The format for an abstract is very different, however. This project will require an abstract in the Spring 2025.\nPoster - November 2024 - google slides (or something else, like quarto) containing the working draft for our poster, due in November. The document itself is stored on the main AGIE project drive in the Resources/CS-25-307 folder.\nPoster - April 2025 - google slides (or something else, like quarto) containing the working draft for our poster, due in November.

Why? Are they still active? What was learned? Did they create any rubrics or other artifacts relevant to our project?\nNSF ADVANCE Summary - Task 2 - This report that details the NSF advance program, the partners and papers, and other important features that can influence our direction. Who is responsible for overseeing this draft? ONE person should be owner and others should contribute.\nNIH Landing Page Review - Task 3 - examples of NIH landing pages, what is required, what makesa good or bad landing page. Considerations and lessons learned for design of our landing page.\nAGIE Repository Design - Task 4 - This document describes the AGIE repository design including user personas, information architecture, data structure, etc.\nAGIE Repository Users Guide - Task 5 - This document provides an overview of the AGIE site, how it operates, and how to modify it."
