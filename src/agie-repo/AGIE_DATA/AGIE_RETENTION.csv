Assessing a Student Mentorship Programme at the University of Limpopo: Mentees’ Perspectives,"Letsoalo, ME; Chia, E","This quantitative study, which used secondary data of 55 mentees, out of which 18 (32.73%) were male and 37 (67.27%) were female, investigated university students' perceptions of the Baditi Students Support Programme (BSSP), a mentoring initiative at the University of Limpopo, focusing on gender differences and the programme's overall effectiveness. It highlights mentoring and learning as ongoing, reciprocal processes that benefit mentors and mentees, contributing to a dynamic learning community. The findings indicate that gender does not significantly affect BSSP’s perceptions, with both male and female mentees sharing similar views on its effectiveness and expressing general satisfaction. However, concerns were noted regarding the absence of a student handbook for mentees and the practicality of assigning multiple mentors to one mentee. The study underscores the critical role of mentor selection and preparation and suggests the exploration of alternative mentoring models. It recommends that the University of Limpopo should ensure comprehensive mentor training, support, and systematic evaluation methods to improve its mentoring programme. Furthermore, the study indicates a gap in research on mentoring, particularly for students with high abilities, suggesting an area ripe for further study in the context of higher education.",2024,,"African Journal of Gender, Society & Development",13,4,137-137–161,3151354603,https://doi.org/10.31920/2634-3622/2024/v13n4a7,,#87,Letsoalo 2024,"",""
Mandatory Quotas and Women’s Representation on South African Mining Boards: Levelling the Field or Perpetuating Inequalities?,"Moraka, Nthabiseng V","Globally, women have been a minority in corporate boardrooms for decades, with little improvement witnessed over time. Even with the introduction of quota legislation, boardrooms worldwide are slow in recruiting and retaining women directors. This study examined the impact of quota policies, specifically the South African Mining Charter, on board representation in South African mining companies. In-depth interviews with 36 board members (20 women and 16 men) across six Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed (JSE) mining companies formed the basis of the analysis of the implementation of the quota system. By means of thematic data analysis, the findings of this research revealed contrasting outcomes of quota system implementation in the mining sector boards of quota policy implementation. Firstly, findings show that quotas propelled compliance-based appointments, which were not skills- or merit-based. Secondly findings showed that the quota system facilitated the recruitment of more black women to boards by signalling a tick box exercise, which facilitated a negative board reception. Several black women experienced a sense of mockery, leading to a need to prove their competence, which often resulted in an added burden, particularly for women who regarded themselves, as competent as their male counterparts. Regardless, the women interviewed affirmed that quota targets needed to be imposed with more focus on merit-based recruitment to enhance the radical transformation of board compositions. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and scholars seeking a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics surrounding the implementation of quota legislation. It concludes that quotas are required to enforce radical changes in the gender composition of boards. The implementation of quotas through a competitive recruitment process aimed at selecting skilled women is recommended. A critical mass board (at least three women) as a minimum threshold is recommended to ensure that women are empowered to transform board compositions, cultures, and influence decisions.",2024,,"African Journal of Gender, Society & Development",13,3,331-331–353,3112750479,https://doi.org/10.31920/2634-3622/2024/v13n3a16,,#88,Moraka 2024,"",""
ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEMES IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS ON MATERNAL MORTALITY,"Ilevbare, Oluwatosin; Jato, Terungwa Paul J","This study investigated the relationship between Nigerian women's access to health insurance and maternal mortality, also considering the moderating role of women demographics. The coverage of National/State Health Insurance (NHI) especially as it relates with gender, age of respondents, type of health insurance, level of education of respondents, and area of residence was assessed. A cross-sectional survey of 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset was used. For every 1% rise in the number of women enrolled with health insurance, there is a 53.4% decrease in maternal mortality rate. It was also discovered that the level of education and age significantly influence their access to health insurance, which in turn influenced rate of maternal mortality. The need to strategically increase women's enrolment and coverage in NHI is imperative as this can potentially improve women's health outcomes especially among women with low educational qualification and residents of rural areas. It is therefore recommended that there is a strong policy in place to ensure effective inclusion of vulnerable members (women and children) and rural women under the national/state health insurance scheme.",2024,,Gender & Behaviour,22,2,22810-22824,3153258066,,,#89,Ilevbare 2024,"",""
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ATTRITION FROM THE MEDICATION DISPENSING PROGRAMME IN THE NORTH WEST PROVINCE AMONGST PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV,"Masemola, O; Musie, M; Coetzee-Prinsloo, I","The Centralised Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) programme, introduced in South Africa in 2014, works in partnership with the Health Systems Trust (HST) on behalf of the National Department of Health. The aim of the programme is to provide access to stable HIV- infected clients to receive treatment outside of the clinic at pick up points with shorter queues in a convenient area. This study intended to explore and describe the factors that contribute to the attrition rate amongst people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from the CCMDD programme in the Bojanala District, Northwest Province. A qualitative, explorative, and descriptive approach guided the study. Twelve people living with HIV were purposively sampled and individual interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. Data analysis was done using content analysis. Three main themes emerged from the data, namely patient-related factors, healthcare provider-related factors and resource-related factors, with sub-themes such as financial challenges, patient-nurse interaction, stigmatization, and inadequate knowledge of ARV therapy; resource provider-related issues like medication availability and inconvenient collection periods, addressing these factors is crucial to improving retention in the programme . Results: The factors emerged indicated the need for strategies to address financial support for patients, community education to reduce stigmatization, and enhanced patient education on ARV therapy. Strengthening patient-nurse interactions and ensuring consistent follow-up from the healthcare providers are also essential. Recommendations include ensuring reliable medication availability and flexible collection periods to accommodate patients' schedules.",2024,,Gender & Behaviour,22,2,22838-22846,3153257688,,,#90,Masemola 2024,"",""

Toward a new conceptual framework: Employing a Black feminist approach to the recruitment and retention of Black women faculty in health and medical degree programs,"Wade, Jeannette M","The sociodemographic makeup of the professoriate in health and healthcare has been shown to have direct implications for graduation rates among minoritized populations, diversity in healthcare, the prevalence of health equity scholarship, and population health broadly. Black women academics, who navigate higher education as members of two minoritized groups, need to be intentionally recruited and retained using tailored approaches. Given the historical and ongoing dearth of Black women faculty in health and healthcare, and the mounting literature on health equity highlighting the benefits of Black women representation in healthcare, I propose an approach to the recruitment and retention of Black women using a Black feminist theory. This conceptual framework outlines barriers to recruiting and retaining Black women faculty, as well as culturally tailored and gender-specific means to mitigate them, to create a safe space for Black women scholars to seek employment and thrive once they are there.",2024,,Women's Health,20,,,3150156721,https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057241307091,,#92,Wade 2024,"",""
Changes of bone turnover markers and bone mineral density among postmenopausal Thai women with osteoporosis receiving generic risedronate,"Ammarin Suwan; Tanavalee, Chotetawan; Panyakhamlerd, Krasean; Ngarmukos, Srihatach; Chavaengkiat, Suchanant; Tanavalee, Aree; Chavarin Amarase; Bumphenkiatikul, Thanapob","BackgroundOsteoporosis has been recognized as a significant health issue in Thailand. Pharmacological interventions are important way to prevent fracture. However, one of the main challenges in selecting a medication is high cost, particularly for brand-name drugs. Data on generic bisphosphonate use in Thai are still lacking. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of generic risedronate in postmenopausal Thai women with osteoporosis.MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from December 2022 to January 2024. Serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and procollagen type I N-propeptide (P1NP) were measured at baseline. All participants subsequently received 35 milligrams of oral risedronate once weekly for 52 weeks. Serum CTX and P1NP were remeasured at different time points. BMD was reevaluated at 52 weeks after risedronate treatment initiation.ResultsA total of 80 participants were included. The mean age was 65.2 ± 6.6 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.45 ± 3.49 kg/m2. The median (IQR) serum CTX level at 12 weeks was significantly lower than that at baseline (0.28 (0.16–0.46) ng/mL versus 0.44 (0.26–0.64) ng/mL, respectively; p value < 0.01). The suppression of serum CTX was confirmed at 52 weeks after treatment initiation. Compared with those at baseline, the serum P1NP levels were significantly lower at 24 weeks after treatment initiation (30.33 (19.19–39.58) ng/mL versus 41.90 (30.33–68.67) ng/mL, respectively; p value < 0.01). In terms of the BMD assessment at 52 weeks, significant improvements were observed in both areal BMD (g/cm2) and T scores at all measured sites compared with baseline. The lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD increased from baseline by 4.76%, 3.84% and 4.54%, respectively.ConclusionPostmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were treated with generic risedronate demonstrated significant suppression of the bone remodelling process at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Additionally, significant improvements in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD were observed at 12 months of therapy. These findings suggest that generic risedronate could be considered a reasonable and interesting option for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Thailand.",2024,,BMC Women's Health,24,,1-9,3126416667,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03404-5,,#93,AmmarinSuwan 2024,"",""
Barriers and facilitators of retention in care after cervical cancer screening: patients’ and healthcare providers’ perspectives,"Owokuhaisa, Judith; Turyakira, Eleanor; Ssedyabane, Frank; Tusubira, Deusdedit; Rogers Kajabwangu; Musinguzi, Pius; Galiwango, Martin; Randall, Thomas C; Kakongi, Nathan; Castro, Cesar M; Atukunda, Esther C; Maling, Samuel","BackgroundCervical cancer continues to threaten women’s health, especially in low-resource settings. Regular follow-up after screening and treatment is an effective strategy for monitoring treatment outcomes. Consequently, understanding the factors contributing to patient non-attendance of scheduled follow-up visits is vital to providing high-quality care, reducing morbidity and mortality, and unnecessary healthcare costs in low-resource settings.MethodsA descriptive qualitative study was done among healthcare providers and patients who attended the cervical cancer screening clinic at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in southwestern Uganda. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed in line with the social-ecological model to identify barriers and facilitators.ResultsWe conducted 23 in-depth interviews with 5 healthcare providers and 18 patients. Health system barriers included long waiting time at the facility, long turnaround time for laboratory results, congestion and lack of privacy affecting counselling, and healthcare provider training gaps. The most important interpersonal barrier among married women was lacking support from male partners. Individual-level barriers were lack of money for transport, fear of painful procedures, emotional distress, and illiteracy. Inadequate and inaccurate information was a cross-cutting barrier across the individual, interpersonal, and community levels of the socio-ecological model. The facilitators were social support, positive self-perception, and patient counselling.ConclusionsOur study revealed barriers to retention in care after cervical cancer screening, including lack of partner support, financial and educational constraints, and inadequate information.

Development and validation of a prediction model for postoperative urinary retention after prolapse surgery: A retrospective cohort study,"Kim, Min Ju; Lee, Sungyoung; Lee, So Yeon; Oh, Sumin; Jeon, Myung Jae","BackgroundPostoperative urinary retention (POUR), a common condition after prolapse surgery with potential serious sequelae if left untreated, lacks a clearly established optimal timing for catheter removal. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for postoperative urinary retention lasting > 2 and > 4 days after prolapse surgery.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of 1,122 patients undergoing prolapse surgery. The dataset was divided into training and testing cohorts. POUR was defined as the need for continuous intermittent catheterization resulting from a failed spontaneous voiding trial, with passing defined as two consecutive voids ≥ 150 mL and a postvoid residual urine volume ≤ 150 mL. We performed logistic regression and the predicted model was validated using both training and testing cohorts.ResultsAmong patients, 31% and 12% experienced POUR lasting > 2 and > 4 days, respectively. Multivariable logistic model identified 6 predictors. For predicting POUR, internal validation using cross-validation approach showed good performance, with accuracy lasting > 2 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.73) and > 4 days (AUC 0.75). Split validation using pre-separated dataset also showed good performance, with accuracy lasting > 2 (AUC 0.73) and > 4 days (AUC 0.74). Calibration curves demonstrated that the model accurately predicted POUR lasting > 2 and > 4 days (from 0 to 80%).ConclusionsThe proposed prediction model can assist clinicians in personalizing postoperative bladder care for patients undergoing prolapse surgery by providing accurate individual risk estimates.",2024,,BMC Women's Health,24,,1-7,3066894095,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03171-3,,#95,Kim 2024,"",""
Retaining U.S. stem women faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic: the important role of family-supportive supervisor behaviors to lower work-to-life conflict,"Lawson, Katie M; Lee, Soomi; Smith, Claire; Thiem, Kelsey C","PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the careers of U.S. women faculty in computer science (CS) – a field with few women and high attrition rates among women – due to difficulties balancing increased work and family demands (author citation). Thus, it is important to understand whether supervisors may help to decrease this work-to-life conflict and increase the odds of retaining women faculty. This study examined whether family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) were associated with better retention-related job outcomes (e.g., lower turnover intentions) among women faculty in CS, and whether this association was mediated by lower work-to-life conflict.Design/methodology/approachA total of 379 CS faculty across the U.S. (54% women, 52% with children at home) were surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fall 2020-Spring 2021).FindingsCompared to men, women CS faculty reported significantly higher work-to-life conflict, and that higher work-to-life conflict predicted poorer retention-related work outcomes for all faculty. However, for women only, FSSB predicted lower levels of work-to-life conflict, and in turn, better retention-related work outcomes.Practical implicationsResults suggest that emotionally-supportive supervisor behaviors may lower work-to-life conflict during the pandemic, which has important implications for retention-related work outcomes among women faculty in CS.Originality/valueResearch has yet to disentangle how managers can help to retain women CS faculty in light of the increasing and changing work and home demands due to the pandemic.

"MICROINSURANCE, GENDER DISPARITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF SMEs IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN NIGERIA","Olowu, Akinseye","Mitigating the possible consequences of negative occurrence is managed differently across male and female owned businesses. This is due to their perception of risk and the accessibility of resources. However, since risk management comes at a cost to the insured, the novelty of micro insurance in the Nigerian business environment avails small businesses the opportunity to be insured. This study therefore examined the influence of micro insurance access on the performance of selected male and female owned SMEs in the agriculture sector using multi-stage sampling technique. A total of two hundred and fifty (250) copies of questionnaire were administered equally to agriculture product exporters but only two hundred and twenty-nine (229) copies were useable for this study representing 91.6% response rate. The stated hypotheses were tested using regression analysis at 0.05 level of significance. The findings revealed that the business efficiency of female owned SMEs were more significantly influenced by their accessibility of micro insurance, while the customer satisfaction and employee retention of male owned SMEs were more influenced by their accessibility of micro insurance when compare with their counterparts in the agriculture sector. It is however recommended that the responsibilities of micro insurance firms should go beyond insuring the SMEs, rather they can act as business and managerial advisors to the SMEs in order to ensure sustainability of both parties. However, understanding this disparity is critical for policy makers in the pursuit of meeting up with SDG 5 on gender equality and empowerment.",2023,,Gender & Behaviour,21,3,21982-21993,3153913215,,,#97,Olowu 2023,"",""
"EXPLORING THE INTERPLAY OF MASCULINITY, MORTALITY, AND CULTURAL CUSTOMS IN WOLE SOYINKA'S THE STRONG BREED",Anonymous,"This paper explores the interplay between masculinity, mortality, and cultural customs in Wole Soyinka's The Strong Breed.

Despite the extensive research conducted on the play, there has been limited exploration of these specific aspects. The paper delves into the deeply ingrained gender roles, rituals, and beliefs that shape the characters' lives. The true man in the play is a man who is willing to die for the sake of others. Masculinity, as portrayed by the protagonist Eman, becomes a complex and tragic force driving both destruction and redemption. At the heart of the narrative are the cultural customs that define the character's existence. In this paper, the traditional representation of death and dying is a catalyst for envisioning masculine identity.

The purpose of the present research was to replicate and extend the results of previous studies concerning the connections that ED has with partner-directed behaviors using a sample of heterosexual romantic couples. Specifically, we used an actor-partner interdependence mediation model to examine whether the associations that ED had with men’s mate retention behaviors, partner-directed insults, partner-directed violence, and partner-inflicted injuries were mediated by suspicious jealousy, but not reactive jealousy. These associations were examined in 113 romantic couples, using men’s self-reports, and partner-reports provided by their female partners. Results indicated that suspicious jealousy (but not reactive jealousy) mediated the associations that ED had with men’s use of partner-directed behaviors, such that higher levels of ED were associated with men experiencing more suspicious jealousy, which, in turn, was associated with more cost-inflicting mate retention behaviors, benefit-provisioning mate retention behaviors, partner-directed insults, partner-directed violence, and partner-inflicted injury.

The proposed hypotheses were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling.FindingsThe outcomes from the test of hypotheses suggest that women’s compassionate managerial leadership behaviors negatively relate to physical isolation among virtual workers. Conversely, a positive link was found between women’s compassionate managerial leadership behaviors and trust building. Further, an inverse association was found between women’s compassionate managerial leadership behaviors and turnover intention among virtual workers.Practical implicationsBased on the findings, organizations may consider deploying more women managers to virtual work schedules to address trust, isolation and turnover intention challenges. Also, HR practitioners may consider training male managers in virtual work on how to restructure their relationships with subordinates to reflect compassionate attributes so that subordinates can feel safe sharing their worries with them for timely support.

Robotic life of casino employees: exploring well-being dimensions in the gambling industry in Malaysia,"Chaichi, Kamelia; Trupp, Alexander; Ranjanthran, Mageswari; Thirumaran, K","PurposeEmployee well-being in a casino work environment is crucial for the quality of work-life and employees' performance. This study examines the dimensions of well-being at a casino in Malaysia to gain deeper insights into employee challenges and motivational factors to arrive at practical mitigation efforts.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a qualitative approach involving 14 semi-structured interviews with casino employees in Malaysia. Interviews lasted 30 min to 2 h at a time when Covid-19 was raging in 2021. Responses were analysed via a data-driven approach and coded using NVivo software to delineate the contents into analytical categories of well-being dimensions.FindingsThe findings suggest that employees at the casino face challenges in achieving work-life balance. Employee's well-being suffers from insufficient break time, irregular working hours affecting family time, managing customer temper tantrums and lack of emotional support systems and remunerations altered by the pandemic. Women employees were particularly vulnerable.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings suggest a need to create better working conditions and address well-being with counselling support for stress management, a balanced approach by employers to the “customer is always right” mantra, creating promising career pathways and supervisors to have better oversight of workaholics. The research focused only on one casino and there was limited access to management departments for an organizational perspective.Originality/valueThis study adds to the body of knowledge on employee well-being in the context of a casino. It suggests hospitality and tourism organizations review their human resource practices that would ease the stresses at the workplace and create support systems to promote employee well-being.

The Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. Computer Science Faculty’s Turnover Intentions: The Role of Gender,"Lawson, Katie M.; Barrineau, MaryJon; Woodling, Chloe M.; Ruggles, Sydney; Largent, David L.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for college faculty, with evidence that it has the potential to exacerbate pre-pandemic gender inequities in work demands (Tugend, 2020). The impact of the pandemic may be particularly difficult for women in male-dominated STEM fields such as computer science that pose additional challenges and had high attrition rates among women faculty pre-pandemic (NSF, 2019; Weisgram & Diekman, 2017). The present study examined the mechanisms through which gender may have implications for changes in turnover intentions due to the pandemic among computer science faculty, with a focus on changes in work-family conflict and workplace attitudes. A total of 317 tenure-line and non-tenure line computer science faculty across the U.S. (54.26% women, 49.84% tenured) completed a survey that included items examining whether the pandemic changed work-family conflict, work-related attitudes (job satisfaction, sense of belonging, burnout), and turnover intentions. Results of analyses indicated that identifying as a woman indirectly predicted larger increases in turnover intentions due to the pandemic, through increased work-family conflict, burnout at work, and decreased feelings of job satisfaction. The results suggest that the pandemic has the potential to increase women’s attrition from computer science faculty positions, further exacerbating their underrepresentation.",2023,,Sex Roles,88,7-8,383-396,2807979806,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-023-01361-1,,#107,Lawson 2023,"",""
Thriving at work with ADHD: antecedents and outcomes of proactive disclosure,"McIntosh, Cheryl K; Hyde, Shelia A; Bell, Myrtle P; Yeatts, Paul E","PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine factors relating to the decision to proactively disclose a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a concealable stigmatized identity, before experiencing performance issues at work. These factors include stigma consciousness, psychological safety, and job demands. Proactive disclosure is also measured in relation to thriving.Design/methodology/approachData were collected through the online research platform Prolific. Variables of interest were measured using surveys of 166 working adults who have ADHD. Path analysis was used to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe authors hypothesized that stigma consciousness is negatively related to proactive disclosure of ADHD at work and that psychological safety and job demands are positively related to it. The authors further hypothesized that proactive disclosure mediates the relationship between these variables and thriving at work. The results partially support these hypotheses, indicating that stigma consciousness is negatively related to proactive disclosure while psychological safety is positively related. Proactive disclosure fully mediates the relationship between stigma consciousness and thriving and partially mediates the relationship between psychological safety and thriving. Job demands relate to thriving but are not significantly related to proactive disclosure.Practical implicationsOrganizations can help employees who have concealable disabilities to proactively disclose them and thrive by providing a psychologically safe environment where disabilities are not stigmatized.Originality/valueThis study diverges from previous studies by measuring positive contextual and individual factors that help employees who have ADHD to thrive in the workplace.

"""Am I More than a Housewife""? An Exploration of Education, Empowerment, and Gender Preference in Relation to Female Genital Cutting/Mutilation in the Far North Region of Cameroon","Nyok1, Maurine Ekun","Despite the United Nations (UN) efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, gender discrimination remains visible in most regions of Cameroon. Traditional practices such as female genital cutting/mutilation and early marriage violate the human rights of their victims and continue to perpetuate gender gaps, leaving women vulnerable and dependent on their male counterparts for their daily needs. The aim of this ethnographic study is to examine the influence of the traditional practice of female genital cutting/mutilation (FGC/FGM) in the face of modernity and as a driver of gender inequality. Study participants were girls and women from the Far North Region of Cameroon and activists and academics involved in the study of FGC/FGM. A total of 36 participants were interviewed. This study shows that within these communities, the practice of FGC/FGM contributes to constructing gaps between men and women in education, empowerment, and offspring gender preference. By examining how these gaps are perpetuated, this study highlights the reasons for the region's high illiteracy rate among women, the lack of female empowerment, and why parents prefer having male children over female children. This study also reveals that women in this part of Cameroon are primarily recognized only in specific areas of life, such as in the housewife role, their ability to satisfy their husbands, start biological reproduction, and perform household chores. Victims of FGC/FGM are often limited to household roles, thereby depriving them of fundamental human rights and opportunities. This study contributes to the existing research on how the practice of FGC/FGM promotes gender inequalities in different areas of life. This work is rooted in the shared experiences of women themselves, revealing how they conceptualize the practice of FGC/FGM.",2023,,Journal of International Women's Studies,25,1,1-16,2778390721,,,#109,Nyok1 2023,"",""

Care work tends to be gendered and we therefore expect that lockdown will have impacted men and women differently. This study used mixed methods to investigate the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on care work perfomed by different categories of staff at a South African university. Findings from thematic analysis reveal common themes which emerged around care work in the home during lockdown. These are, inter alia, the importance of community, balance, partnership and career. Within these common themes, different experiences are further dissected in this article. We conclude that gender norms underpinning care work are complex, fluid and context dependent, but that the lockdown helped participants realise the importance of achieving the right work-life balance.",2022,,Gender & Behaviour,20,4,20469-20486,2793117155,,,#111,Claassen 2022,"",""
PATTERNS AND PREDICTORS OF CHILDHOOD UNDERNUTRITION IN NIGERIA FROM 2008-2018: A POOLED DATA ANALYSIS,"Philip, Falade Adekunle; Kolawole, Odusina Emmanuel","Childhood undernutrition remain a public health problem, despite several policies and initiatives are being implemented to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 3, which aim to eradicate all forms of hunger and malnutrition and to improve child well-being by 2030. This study examined the pattern and predictors of Childhood Undernutrition in Nigeria from 2008-2018. The study used a cross-sectional dataset from Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys years 2008, 2013 and 2018. The respondents selected were 7,394 women of reproductive age with at least one child in the five years preceding the surveys. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis of frequency distribution, bivariate analysis of Chi-square test and multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression model. The stunting and underweight cases among children though slightly decreased over the years, were still on high side. Stunting was 47.5% in 2008, 36% in 2013 and 36% in 2018 while underweight was 31.1% in 2008, 30.5% in 2013 and 22.7% in 2018. The multivariate analysis showed that childhood stunting and underweight was statistically significantly associated with age of mothers, age at first birth, region, religion, level of education, wealth status, place of delivery, birth order, antenatal visit, place of residence, visitation to health facility within the last 12 months, exposure to media and employment status, preceding birth interval, decision making on health care and contraceptive use (P < 0.05). The study concluded that age of mothers, age at first birth, region, religion, level of education, wealth status, place of delivery and birth order were related to childhood under-nutrition in Nigeria. The study ascertained the needs for intervention programmes against childhood under-nutrition would help to mitigate short and long terms adverse outcomes among children in Nigeria.

Is childcare cost a barrier to women managers' retention and progress at large firms?,"Choudhary, Amod","Purpose>The impact of childcare cost and childcare responsibilities has generally negatively impacted women in workforce.

The relationship between the severity of perimenstrual symptoms and a regular exercise habit in Japanese young women: a cross-sectional online survey,"Mizuta, Rami; Maeda, Noriaki; Komiya, Makoto; Suzuki, Yuta; Tashiro, Tsubasa; Kaneda, Kazuki; Tsutsumi, Shogo; Ishihara, Honoka; Kuroda, Sayo; Urabe, Yukio","Background Experiencing perimenstrual symptoms is a major health concern for young women. Women in the reproductive age experience menstruation about once a month, and many experience perimenstrual symptoms. Drug therapies such as painkillers (commonly used) and hormonal medications help to achieve symptomatic relief from perimenstrual symptoms. However, many women are concerned about tolerance and compliance of the drugs used to treat perimenstrual symptoms and lack awareness on how to cope with perimenstrual symptoms. If the association between exercise habits and the severity of symptoms is emphasized in young women, methods for coping with perimenstrual symptoms can be established, not relying only on pharmaceuticals. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the severity of perimenstrual symptoms in young Japanese women with and without a regular exercise habit.Methods A cross-sectional study using an online survey was sent among 500 Japanese women aged 18–25 years. The severity of perimenstrual symptoms was assessed using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ). The differences in MDQ scores between those with and without exercise habits (exercise for more than 30 min for 2 days a week) were compared using the chi-square test and Mann–Whitney U test. The logistic regression analysis detected subscales of the premenstrual and menstrual symptoms affected by an exercise habit.Results 282 (56.4%) young Japanese women were answered this survey. Respondents were divided into the exercise group (n = 157) and the non-exercise group (n = 125). The exercise group had significantly low premenstrual and menstrual MDQ scores. The results of the logistic regression analysis stated that the subscale related to negative emotion before menstruation was associated with an exercise habit. In the analysis performed during menstruation, a statistically significant association was detected between an exercise habit and a behavioral change such as avoiding interaction with others.Conclusions This study suggested that exercise habits may reduce the severity of perimenstrual symptoms and could help to develop a non-pharmacological coping strategy. In addition, this study provides useful information for young women who want to prevent perimenstrual symptoms but do not have an exercise habit.

We adapted a multilevel intervention to improve HIV outcomes and overall well-being among trans women sex workers living with HIV. The intervention, called Abriendo Puertas (AP; Opening Doors), included: individual counseling, peer navigation, and community mobilization “open houses.” The purpose of this article is to describe acceptability and initial outcomes of the adapted AP pilot and explore intervention experiences to inform recommendations for improvement.Methods: After an iterative adaptation process, we recruited 30 trans women sex workers living with HIV to participate in the pilot. We conducted baseline and endline (12-months) surveys to compare HIV care and treatment outcomes and qualitative interviews to assess intervention experiences with a subsample (n=20).Results: Intervention retention was high, with 86.7% of participants (n=26/30) completing both baseline and endline surveys. At endline, there was a significant increase in current anti-retroviral therapy (ART) use (70.0% to 84.6%, p<0.03) and positive, but not significant, trends in missed care appointments in the past 6 months (34.5% to 20.0%, p<0.39) and not having missed any ART doses in the past 4 days (85.7% to 95.5%, p<0.50). Intervention acceptability was high across all components: individual counseling (96.1%), peer navigation (80.8%), and open houses (84.6%). Participants emphasized that trust and being treated with respect allowed them to relax and improve their self-esteem. Limited trust and cohesion among trans women, however, limited more extensive engagement with peer navigation and community mobilization components.Conclusion: Future efforts to strengthen the AP intervention with trans women sex workers should continue to address emotional, instrumental, and informational support needs related to living with HIV through individual counseling, peer navigation, and open houses while also enhancing group-level activities to build trust and generate a collective commitment to promote the well-being of the community.",2021,,Transgender Health,6,3,148-155,2536822133,https://doi.org/10.1089/trgh.2020.0058,,#118,Barrington 2021,"",""
Building an Inclusive Talent Pipeline: A Study on Women of the Indian Informational Technology Sector,"Alok, Swati; Banerjee, Sudatta; Khan, Mohammed A Rahman","Of the many women that are a part of the Informational Technology (IT) workforce, very few make it to senior roles. Occupational commitment measured as affective (AC), normative (NC), and continuance (CC) as well as career satisfaction (CS) are considered to be crucial in understanding this pattern of women not making it to senior roles. AC explains one's emotional attachment to their career, NC is the obligation to stay the course in a career, and CC explains the opportunity cost to transfer from one career to the next. This study aims to understand the role of individual determinants (career identity, career adaptability) and occupational culture fit (the concept of screening potential candidates that is focused on aligning employees and employers with shared values, beliefs, and attitudes). This study also focuses on forms of organizational support (managerial support, job autonomy) that either act as enablers or barriers to sustaining commitment and satisfaction in IT occupations. Data collected from 200 IT women with at least 5 years of experience working in top 20 NASCOM companies were regressed to test the hypotheses. The result indicated that women with high scores in occupational culture (i.e., greater congruence with IT occupational demands) show higher career satisfaction (CS), affective commitment (AC), and normative commitment (NC). This indicates that there is a chance for organizations to actively improve women's occupational demand of long, late, and erratic work schedules by looking at their safety and providing flexi-timing to help them manage a work-life balance. A performance evaluation system that focuses on results, rather than hours of effort, and that allows women flexibility to attend to certain late-night commitments at home could go a long way in helping them achieve a better culture fit. Women with strong career identities show higher AC and CC. Women that have high career identities are intrinsically motivated and place a high value on their work; hence, they continuously seek skill improvement opportunities. Employers can utilize this knowledge to proactively identify female employees with high career identities early in their professional journey then engage them in tasks that are meaningful and aligned with their interests and values. Further, results indicated that job autonomy-a person's ability to have an influence over what happens in their work environment, in particular, the ability to influence matters that are relevant to their personal goals-led to higher CC; higher managerial support leads to career satisfaction, thereby indicating that managers can provide support by providing a participative decision-making mechanism and flexible timing for better work-life balance.",2021,,"Journal of International Women's Studies, suppl.

To address these gaps in the literature, we carried out two studies to develop and validate a new Mating Effort Questionnaire (MEQ). In Study 1, we report a pilot study in which participants’ responses to an item pool were submitted to exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, we replicated the structure found in Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample. A three-factor solution yielded the best fit. The three factors reflected respondents’ allocation of energy to attracting high mate value partners when already mated, seeking out romantic partners when single, and investing in their current romantic partner and relationships. Strong partial measurement invariance held across the sexes, implying that observed scores may be used to compare them. We also found evidence of concurrent validity via associations between the MEQ and constructs such as sociosexual orientation, K-factor, mate retention behaviors, and respondents’ sexual behavior.

Mapping the health systems response to violence against women: key learnings from five LMIC settings (2015–2020),"Sikder, Shegufta Shefa; Ghoshal, Rakhi; Bhate-Deosthali, Padma; Jaishwal, Chandni; Nobhojit Roy","Background Violence against women (VAW) is a global challenge, and the health sector is a key entry point for survivors to receive care. The World Health Organization adopted an earlier framework for health systems response to survivors. However, documentation on the programmatic rollout of health system response to violence against women is lacking in low and middle-income countries. This paper studies the programmatic roll out of the health systems response across select five low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and identifies key learnings.Methods We selected five LMIC settings with recent or active programming on national-level health system response to VAW from 2015 to 2020. We synthesized publicly available data and program reports according to the components of the WHO Health Systems Framework. The countries selected are Bangladesh, Brazil, Nepal, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka.Results One-stop centers were found to be the dominant model of care located in hospitals in four countries. Each setting has implemented in-service training as key to addressing provider knowledge, attitudes and practice; however, significant gaps remain in addressing frequent staff turnover, provision of training at scale, and documentation of the impact of training. The health system protocols for VAW address sexual violence but do not uniformly include clinical and health policy responses for emotional or economic violence. Providing privacy to survivors within health facilities was a universal challenge.Conclusion Significant efforts have been made to address provider attitudes towards provision of care and to protocolize delivery of care to survivors, primarily through one-stop centers. Further improvements can be made in data collection on training impact on provider attitudes and practices, in provider identification of VAW survivors, and in prioritization of VAW within health system budgeting, staffing, and political priorities.

This study aims to evaluate early treatment with estradiol valerate on bone turnover markers after surgically induced menopause.Methods This prospective study included 41 pre and perimenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy with oophorectomy for benign gynecologic conditions. Two weeks after the operation, all participants were assessed for menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) indications. Estrogen therapy was prescribed for those who had indications and accepted treatment (hormone treatment group). The others who had no MHT indication were allocated to the no-treatment group. Serum CTX and P1NP levels at preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative were measured and set as the primary outcome.

Postoperative urinary retention after pelvic organ prolapse surgery: influence of peri-operative factors and trial of void protocol,"Anglim, B C; Ramage, K; Sandwith, E; Brennand, E A","Purpose Transient postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is common after pelvic floor surgery. We aimed to determine the association between peri-operative variables and POUR and to determine the number of voids required for post-void residuals (PVRs) to normalize postoperatively.Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 992 patients undergoing pelvic floor surgery at a tertiary referral centre from January 2015 to October 2017. Variables assessed included: age, BMI, ASA score, anaesthesia type, type of surgery, length of postoperative stay, surgeon, bladder protocol used, and number of PVRs required to “pass” the protocol.Results Significant risk factors for POUR included: placement of MUS during POP surgery, anterior repair and hysterectomy with concomitant sacrospinous vault suspension. A total of 25.1% were discharged requiring catheterization. Patients receiving a concomitant mid-urethral sling (MUS) were 2.2 (95% CI1.6–2.9) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.8–3.1) times more likely to have elevated PVR after their second TOV and third TOV (p < 0.0001), respectively, compared with those without concomitant MUS. Permitting a third TOV allowed an additional 10% of women to pass the voiding protocol before discharge. The median number of voids to pass protocol was 2. An ASA > 2 and placement of MUS were associated with increasing number of voids needed to pass protocol.Conclusions While many women passed protocol by the second void, using the 3rd void as a cut point to determine success would result in fewer women requiring catheterization after discharge. Prior to pelvic floor surgery, women should be counselled regarding POUR probability to allow for management of postoperative expectations.",2021,,BMC Women's Health,21,,1-11,2528895427,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01330-4,,#123,Anglim 2021,"",""
Feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored physical activity intervention for Arab-Australian women,"Aymen El Masri; Kolt, Gregory S; George, Emma S","Background Despite being one of the largest migrant groups in Australia, few physical activity interventions exist for Arab-Australians. The primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week culturally tailored physical activity intervention for Arab-Australian women.Methods This study used a single-group pretest–posttest design, and was informed by extensive formative research and consultation involving the Arab-Australian community. Participants were insufficiently active Arab-Australian women aged 35–64 with no current illness or injury that would limit physical activity participation. The intervention comprised 6 face-to-face physical activity and education sessions over 12 weeks. The intervention was conducted at 2 separate intervention sites in Western Sydney, Australia. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, session attendance, and retention. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed through a process evaluation questionnaire completed post-intervention. Accelerometers and the short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire were used to measure physical activity at baseline and post-intervention. Descriptive statistics were used for feasibility and acceptability outcomes, and changes in physical activity were examined using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.Results Of the 53 women who were contacted or expressed interest, 22 were eligible and enrolled in the study. Participants were primarily recruited through direct contact by Arab-Australian community workers and by word-of-mouth. Average session attendance was 63% and the retention rate post-intervention was 68%. The culturally-related intervention components, such as the appropriateness of content, and women-only setting, were rated highly favourably (4.33 to 4.87/5). General intervention elements, such as the face-to-face delivery, knowledge and approachability of facilitators, and session structure, were also rated favourably (4.33 to 4.93/5), and the lowest scored item was the intervention session frequency (3.2/5). There were no statistically significant changes in physical activity post-intervention.Conclusions The findings from this study highlighted factors related to recruitment and delivery that need to be considered when developing physical activity interventions for Arab-Australian women. Further research is required using a larger sample and a randomised controlled trial design to examine the longer-term impact on physical activity, and to also examine ways of increasing intervention engagement and retention among Arab-Australian women.Trial Registration: ANZCTR, ACTRN12618001392257.

Sexual Minority Women in Longitudinal Survey Research: Is Attrition a Problem?,"Campbell, Alice; Perales, Francisco; Baxter, Janeen","As more longitudinal surveys collect information on sexual orientation, evaluating the quality of these data and understanding how sexual minorities engage with the survey process are increasingly important endeavors. This study constitutes the first systematic analysis of sexual orientation as a predictor of attrition from longitudinal surveys. Drawing upon the minority stress model, we developed testable hypotheses about how sexual identity and sexual identity change relate to panel attrition. These hypotheses were subsequently tested using data from two national cohorts of Australian women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (one born 1973–1978, n = 11,262, and one born 1989–1995, n = 16,689). In the older cohort, sexual minority women were more likely to attrit from the survey than exclusively heterosexual women—largely due to noncontact rather than noncooperation. The associations faded once sociodemographic and health-related covariates were included in the models. Further, higher rates of noncontact were observed among women who changed their sexual identity in a more same-sex-oriented direction, compared to women with a stable sexual identity. None of these associations were apparent in the younger cohort. Taken together, our results suggest that sexual minority status may be a risk factor for panel attrition among older but not younger cohorts of women and that improved efforts to locate and contact participants who are generally vulnerable could increase the retention of sexual minorities in longitudinal studies. Effect sizes were nevertheless small, suggesting that existing research on sexual orientation using longitudinal surveys is unlikely to be biased by non-random attrition of non-heterosexual individuals.",2020,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,49,5,1443-1461,2414130741,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01669-z,,#127,Campbell 2020,"",""

FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CIGARETTE SMOKING AND ITS HEALTH EFFECTS AMONGST STUDENTS AT A SELECTED UNIVERSITY IN SOUTH AFRICA,"Thendele, M; Mashau, M S; Tshitangano, T G; Murwira, T S","Background: Globally, cigarette smoking is causing preventable deaths in developing countries especially among the youth. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to assess factors that contribute to cigarette smoking and its health effects amongst students at a selected university in South Africa. Methodology: A cross-sectional descriptive quantitative survey design was conducted at a rural-based university in South Africa. Convenience sampling was used to select 407 students. A self-administered questionnaire was utilised to gather data and was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Chi-square tests (y2) were employed to determine the association between smoking and demographic variables. Results: The prevalence of smoking among students was (175/43.3%). Most participants were females and the mean age of the sample population was 24. The study found perceived personal, social-cultural, and environmental factors that contributed to cigarette smoking among students. The majority of the students perceived factors that drive students to smoke cigarettes as being stress (322/80,2%), having friends that smoke (278/78.4%), having family members (223/74.8%), having a roommate (297/72.7%), lack of rules/signage that prohibits smoking in campus (281/69%), easy availability of cigarettes in campus (252/62%), absence of parental influence (224/55%), and regular adverts of cigarette (267/65%). Students were aware that smoking causes lung diseases 332 (81.5%), lung cancer 354 (87.8%), heart diseases 308 (75.6%), hypertension (260/64.6%), effects on unborn babies (327/80.4%), delays in wound healing, (299 /74%) and chances that it triggers asthma (317 /78.1%). Conclusion: The study concludes that students smoke cigarettes due to a variety of factors, therefore, there is a need to target these factors when developing on-campus anti-smoking strategies.",2020,,"Gender & Behaviour, suppl.

THE IMPACT OF ELECTRICITY TARIFF INCREASE ON INDIGENT WOMEN IN SOUTH AFRICA,"Odeku, Kola O","This article looks at the persistent electricity tariff hikes in South Africa and their impact on women, especially the indigent women considering the fact that many indigent women are single parents and they rely solely on conventional electricity being supplied by Eskom for virtually all their domestic and enterprise activities. While Eskom generates and supplies electricity, the price with which it supplies to the consumer is determined by National Energy Regulator (NERSA). In the event of any electricity price review, NERSA has to grant Eskom permission to increase or not to increase the tariff. In recent years, Eskom has continuously been approaching NERSA for permission to increase the cost of electricity considering that it is the only regulator with mandate to approve any price increases. These increases are huge burden on women and many households despite the Free Basic Electricity (FBE) which is not adequate for an average household. This article indicates that it is unfair to transfer the financial debt that has been accumulated as a result of corruption, mal-administration and mismanagement by Eskom to consumers, especially indigent women. It is suggested that the FBE programme should continue but remarkable reform should be made to make the incentive more useful and adequate.

It’s complicated: a multi-method approach to broadening participation in STEM,"Valerie Gray Hardcastle; Furst-Holloway, Stacie; Kallen, Rachel; Jacquez, Farrah","PurposeA lot is known about systemic barriers to broadening participation (BP) in STEM. Empirical research has demonstrated the existence and impact of implicit bias, stereotype threat, and micro-aggressions on a sense of belonging, organizational productivity and leadership opportunities. We also know that achieving greater participation of women and faculty of color in the STEM disciplines is complicated and depends on altering complex and multi-layered interactions between activities and actors. Further, because researcher and institutional goals vary as a function of target population and context, generalizable models can struggle in the face of larger BP efforts. Through the authors experience as an NSF ADVANCE-IT awardee, the authors believe that a dynamic, multi-scaled and organizational level approach is required to reflect the reciprocal dialogue among research questions, best practices, tailored applications and quantifiable goals. The authors describe several examples of research, programming activities and program evaluation that illustrate this approach. In particular, the authors describe both the programming successes and challenges, with the aim of helping others to avoid common mistakes by articulating very broad and, the authors’ hope, generalizable “lessons learned.” The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo better understand the barriers for women in STEM, the authors utilized an iterative methodology. Specifically, the authors conducted a social network analysis, an exit survey of departed faculty, longitudinal analysis of career trajectories and research productivity, and a survey on the interaction between values and climate.FindingsThe analyses suggest three strategies better retain women in STEM: improve women’s professional networks; re-aling policy documents and departmental practices to better reflect faculty values; and improve departmental climate.Practical implicationsThe pay-off for using this more complex research approach to triangulate onto specific challenges is that the interventions are more likely to be successful, with a longer-lasting impact.Originality/valueWith continuous institutional research, metric refinement, and program evaluation the authors are better able to develop targeted programming, policy reform, and changes in institutional practice.

Land Grant University implemented retention and advancement efforts campus-wide rather than only in STEM areas, including five FLCs for women, URM faculty and NTT faculty. The primary sources of data were retention and promotion data of all faculty at the institution (including the FLC participants) and participant observations of the five FLCs for five years.FindingsThe analysis of retention and advancement data showed that participation in FLCs positively impacted retention and promotion of participants. The analysis of participant observations allowed the authors to gain insights into what was happening in FLCs that differed from faculty’s experiences in home departments. The authors found that FLCs created third spaces that allowed individuals to face and transgress the most damaging aspects of organizational culture and dwell, at least for some time, in a space of different possibilities.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors suggest additional studies be conducted on FLCs and their success in improving retention and advancement among women, URM and NTT faculty. While the authors believe there is a clear professional growth and satisfaction benefit to FLCs regardless of their effect on retention and advancement, NSF and NIH programs focused on increasing the diversity of faculty need to know they are getting the return they seek on their investment and this line of research can provide such evidence as well as enhance the rigor of such programs by improving program elements.Practical implicationsFLCs offer higher education institutions a unique opportunity to critically reflect and understand organizational conditions that are not inclusive for groups of faculty. Professional interactions among colleagues are a critical place where academic and cultural capital is built and exchanged. The authors know from the authors’ own research here, and from much previous social science research that women, URM and NTT faculty often experience exclusionary and isolating professional interactions. FLCs should be created and maintained alongside other more structural and cultural interventions to improve equity for all faculty.Originality/valueThe study’s contribution to the literature is unique, as only a few studies have tracked the subsequent success of participants in mentoring or networking programs.

Women in STEM are underrepresented and more likely to perceive their STEM educational environments as threatening than do men. U.S. Women majoring in STEM fields (n = 579) completed a questionnaire measuring each construct of a model of threatening academic environments proposed by Inzlicht et al. (2009). Supporting the model, greater gender stigma consciousness predicted greater gender-based rejection sensitivity. Gender rejection sensitivity predicted more negative perceptions of campus climate. More negative climate predicted more experiences of stereotype threat, which in turn predicted lower perceived control. Lower perceived control predicted greater disengagement from STEM domains, which predicted lower self-esteem. Differences also emerged between women in male- compared to female-dominated STEM subfields and between racial minority and majority women. This model describes how experiences of threatening environments may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in STEM. The model provides an overview for researchers, educators, and practitioners to better understand the relations among hostile STEM climates, experiences of identity threat, and academic disengagement. Interventions addressing environmental and individual factors in the model may improve retention and women’s experiences in STEM.",2019,,Sex Roles,80,7-8,469-488,2069212137,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0942-4,,#141,Casad 2019,"",""
Unclogging the pipeline: advancement to full professor in academic STEM,"Helga Van Miegroet; Glass, Christy; Ronda Roberts Callister; Sullivan, Kimberly","PurposeWomen remain underrepresented in academic STEM, especially at the highest ranks. While much attention has focused on early-career attrition, mid-career advancement is still largely understudied and undocumented. The purpose of this paper is to analyze gender differences in advancement to full professor within academic STEM at a mid-size public doctoral university in the western USA, before and after the National Science Foundation (NSF)-ADVANCE Program (2003–2008).Design/methodology/approachUsing faculty demographics and promotion data between 2008 and 2014, combined with faculty responses to two waves of a climate survey, the magnitude and longevity of the impact of ADVANCE on mid-career faculty advancement across gender is evaluated.FindingsThis study documents increased representation of women in all ranks within the STEM colleges, including that of full professor due to ADVANCE efforts. It also demonstrates the role of greater gender awareness and formalization of procedures in reducing the variability in the time as associate professor until promotion to full professor for all faculty members, while also shrinking gender disparities in career attainment. As a result of the codification of the post-tenure review timeline toward promotion, more recently hired faculty are promoted more swiftly and consistently, irrespective of gender. Post-ADVANCE, both male and female faculty members express a greater understanding of and confidence in the promotion process and no longer see it as either a hurdle or source of gender inequality in upward career mobility.Research limitations/implicationsWhile data were collected at a single university, demographics and career experiences by women mirror those at other research universities. This study shows that within a given institution-specific governance structure, long-lasting effects on faculty career trajectories can be achieved, by focusing efforts on creating greater transparency in expectations and necessary steps toward promotion, by reducing barriers to information flown, by standardizing and codifying the promotion process, and by actively engaging administrators as collaborators and change agents in the transformation process.Originality/valueThis study addresses mid-career dynamics and potential mechanisms that explain gender gaps in the promotion to full professor, a largely understudied aspect of gender disparities in career attainment within STEM. It shows how institutional policy changes, intended to alleviate gender disparities, can benefit the career trajectories of all faculty members.

"The Power of Language: Gender, Status, and Agency in Performance Evaluations","Smith, David G; Rosenstein, Judith E; Nikolov, Margaret C; Chaney, Darby A","In the workplace, women often encounter gender stereotypes and biases that reinforce the existing gender hierarchy, may hinder women’s career aspirations and retention, and may limit their ability to be promoted—especially in traditionally male organizations. Long-standing and widely held (although often unconscious) beliefs about gender can reinforce women’s perceived lower status position relative to men’s. Because men are described/prescribed as agentic (often masculine) and women as communal (often feminine), women leaders are often evaluated as being status-incongruent. We explore the gendered assignment of leader attributes with particular attention to associations of agentic competence (deficiency for women) and agentic dominance (penalty for women). We examined peer evaluations of 4344 U.S. Naval Academy students who are assigned attributes from a predefined list. Although men and women received similar numbers of descriptive (positive) attributes, women received more proscriptive (negative) attributes than did men and these individual attributes were predominantly feminine. These findings offer evidence that women leaders’ status incongruity may be associated with perceived competence (agentic deficiency). A contribution of our analysis is theory testing using data from a real-life performance evaluation system. Additionally, our research contributes to our knowledge of gendered language and status characteristics in performance evaluations and can assist researchers and practitioners with developing interventions. Understanding the association of gender status beliefs with evaluation processes may facilitate changing workplace culture to be more gender-inclusive through less biased and stereotypical performance evaluations.",2019,,Sex Roles,80,3-4,159,2033531696,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0923-7,,#143,Smith 2019,"",""

Our objective was to investigate associations of social support at 6 months postpartum with women’s health behaviors that have previously been shown to predict weight retention at 1 year postpartum.Methods At 6 months postpartum in Project Viva, a pre-birth prospective cohort in Massachusetts, women reported social support using the Turner Support Scale, depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, diet using PrimeScreen, average number of hours walking, light/moderate and vigorous physical activity, television viewing, and sleeping each day.Results Among 1356 women, greater partner support was associated with higher levels of walking (OR 1.36, 95% CI [1.01, 1.82]) and intake of fiber (OR 1.43, 95% CI [1.06, 1.91]) and lower intake of trans-fat (OR 1.49, 95% CI [1.11, 2.01]).

The paper reviewed two sets of literature that frame differently the construction of identities. The first set of literature is on conceptualisation of identities, and the second set of literature is on theorisation of identities. The paper argues that identities are not static, rather forms of subjectivity of an individual that are subject to change overtime depending on the own sense of agency. In this paper, wider social context and workplace context are found to be pertinent in the identity formation. To this end, the paper pointed out that narratives of what it takes to be an academic are also pertinent since they illustrate how individuals become academics, how they navigate or maneuver through systems, and the challenges they face.

Three research questions and two hypotheses were raised to guide this study. The study employed survey research design and population for this study comprised all the SS II students in Government-owned Senior Secondary Schools in Warri Township of Delta state. A sample size of two hundred (200) school going adolescents were drawn from selected secondary schools in Warri township of Delta State using multi-stage sampling technique. Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) with reliability coefficient 0.786 was used for data collection. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentages and mean) and inferential statistics (t-test and ANOVA). The findings of the study revealed that school going adolescents are academically motivated; male andfemale school going adolescents differ in their academic motivation and older and younger school-going adolescents did not differ. Based on the findings, the study concludes that school going adolescents possess elements of academic motivation and gender played a role in their academic motivation while age did not. The study recommends that parents, teachers, and other education stakeholders should endeavour to extend an appropriate measure of support either psychologically or materially or physically to sustain this level of academic motivation among school-going adolescents.",2019,,"Gender & Behaviour, suppl.

Muscle metabolism and atrophy: let’s talk about sex,"Rosa-Caldwell, Megan E; Greene, Nicholas P","Skeletal muscle health is a strong predictor of overall health and longevity. Pathologies affecting skeletal muscle such as cancer cachexia, intensive care unit treatment, muscular dystrophies, and others are associated with decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Recent research has begun to determine that these muscular pathologies appear to present and develop differently between males and females. However, to our knowledge, there has yet to be a comprehensive review on musculoskeletal differences between males and females and how these differences may contribute to sex differences in muscle pathologies. Herein, we present a review of the current literature on muscle phenotype and physiology between males and females and how these differences may contribute to differential responses to atrophic stimuli. In general, females appear to be more susceptible to disuse induced muscle wasting, yet protected from inflammation induced (such as cancer cachexia) muscle wasting compared to males. These differences may be due in part to differences in muscle protein turnover, satellite cell content and proliferation, hormonal interactions, and mitochondrial differences between males and females. However, more works specifically examining muscle pathologies in females are necessary to more fully understand the inherent sex-based differences in muscle pathologies between the sexes and how they may correspond to different clinical treatments.",2019,,Biology of Sex Differences,10,,,2293475876,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-019-0257-3,,#147,Rosa-Caldwell 2019,"",""
Sex-specific regulation of cardiac microRNAs targeting mitochondrial proteins in pressure overload,"Sanchez-Ruderisch, Hugo; Queirós, Ana Maria; Fliegner, Daniela; Eschen, Claudia; Kararigas, Georgios; Regitz-Zagrosek, Vera","Background Maladaptive remodeling in pressure overload (PO)-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may lead to heart failure. Major sex differences have been reported in this process. The steroid hormone 17β-estradiol, along with its receptors ERα and ERβ, is thought to be crucial for sex differences and is expected to be protective, but this may not hold true for males. Increasing evidence demonstrates a major role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in PO-induced LVH. However, little is known about the effects of biological sex and ERβ on cardiac miRNA regulation and downstream mitochondrial targets. We aimed at the analysis of proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism testing the hypothesis that they are the target of sex-specific miRNA regulation.Methods We employed the transverse aortic constriction model in mice and assessed the levels of five mitochondrial proteins, i.e., Auh, Crat, Decr1, Hadha, and Ndufs4.Results We found a significant decrease of the mitochondrial proteins primarily in the male overloaded heart compared with the corresponding control group. Following computational analysis to identify miRNAs putatively targeting these proteins, our in vitro experiments employing miRNA mimics demonstrated the presence of functional target sites for miRNAs in the 3′-untranslated region of the messenger RNAs coding for these proteins. Next, we assessed the levels of the functionally validated miRNAs under PO and found that their expression was induced only in the male overloaded heart. In contrast, there was no significant effect on miRNA expression in male mice with deficient ERβ.Conclusion We put forward that the male-specific induction of miRNAs and corresponding downregulation of downstream protein targets involved in mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to sex-specific remodeling in PO-induced LVH.",2019,,Biology of Sex Differences,10,,,2183454842,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-019-0222-1,,#148,Sanchez-Ruderisch 2019,"",""
School context: implications for teachers of color,"Madsen, Jean; Mabokela, Reitumetse Obakeng; Luevanos, Elisabeth A","PurposeBy 2026, students of color will make up 54 percent of the school-age population. Literature on recruiting and retaining teachers of color reveal that teachers of color are underrepresented in US schools (Castro et al., 2018). Cultural differences between teachers and students result in higher number of students of color being expelled or suspended, low graduation rates and lower numbers of students of color in advanced math, science and gifted courses. With an emphasis on retaining teachers of color the purpose of this paper is to examine how traditional school contexts play a role in teacher retention.Design/methodology/approachThis was a qualitative case study that examined white teachers’ perceptions about their interactions with African American teachers (Merriam, 1998). A case study was useful in describing the boundaries of the school and how this type of context allowed the researchers to explore intergroup differences between both groups of teachers (Hays and Singh, 2011). Nine white teachers from predominantly white schools in the USA were interviewed (Seidman, 1998). The data were analyzed using what Glaser and Strauss (1967) call a constant comparative method. This process compared the intergroup theory with teachers’ responses.FindingsFindings indicated that white teachers had little or no experience interacting with people who were racially and culturally different from them. Because of their curiosity about race, African American teachers were categorized as the “black expert.” White teachers asked them to speak with African American parents, give expertise on areas of discipline and chair multicultural events. Group boundaries developed rapidly as white teachers overwhelmed teachers of color with only their racial problems. African American teachers were forced into roles, which prevented them from contributing in other areas. Thus, African American teachers grew tired of only playing one aspect of their teaching.Research limitations/implicationsUpon entering their schools, teachers bring with them a broad array of experiences, knowledge, skills and abilities. This results in a form of assimilation where they become like-minded to their schools’ norms and values. As incoming teachers of color enter with different norms and culture, they mediate boundaries having both groups of teachers adjust to cultural differences (Madsen and Mabokela, 2013). Intergroup differences often occur due to changing demographics in schools. If teachers cannot work through these normative conflicts, it will be reflected in teacher turnover, absences, workplace disagreements and teachers of color leaving.Practical implicationsIf the focus is to recruit teachers of color, there needs to be an emphasis on preparing leaders on how to identify and address intergroup differences. As in Bell’s (2002) study and Achinstein’s (2002) research, when teachers have differences it will have influence how teachers will collaborate. Thus, teachers of color are prevented from sharing their philosophy about teaching students of color. These individuals also share the burden of being the only person who can advocate for students of color, but also serve as cultural translators for other students as well.Social implicationsFuture educators not only need to understand how to teach demographically diverse students, but it is important for them to understand how multicultural capital plays an inclusive role in getting all students to do academically well. The question becomes of how one teaches the importance of “humanistic” commitments for all children.Originality/valueBooysen (2014) believes that identity and workplace identity research only allows for integration of divergent perspectives. More study is needed to understand how do workers navigate their identity through the workplace. Workplace identity among group members results in power discrepancies and assimilation verses the preservation of micro cultural identity. Thus, both groups often have competing goals and there is a struggle for resources. Cox (1994) believes that these tensions cause group members to center on preserving of their own culture. Hence, groups are more aware of their need to protect their cultural identity which ultimately affects retention of workers.",2019,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",38,1,56-70,2177147021,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-02-2018-0031,,#149,Madsen 2019,"",""
"EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE MEDIA IN DISSEMINATING HEALTH INFORMATION TO RURAL WOMEN: THE CASE OF MALARIA CAMPAIGNS VIA RADIO IN ANAMBRA STATE, NIGERIA","Nwammuo, Angela N; Salawu, Abiodun","The history of the use of radio programmes at the national and state levels in Nigeria to disseminate malaria prevention and control strategies seems to be as old as the history of the country itself. Radio as a broadcast medium is particularly praised for its strength in enhancing the development process particularly in the rural areas because it is flexible in nature. But despite the fight against malaria over the years, the disease continued to take the lives of children and women of child bearing ages who mostly live in rural communities. This is the reason for the change in the language used in malaria radio campaigns. Indigenous languages are now adopted in producing radio malaria campaigns meant for rural communities in order to achieve higher message comprehension. This study therefore examined the effectiveness of Igbo language in creating awareness about malaria control strategies among women in rural communities of Anambra State, Nigeria. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used in the study as the theoretical framework of analysis. Survey research method was adopted whereas purposive sampling technique was employed in selecting 399 respondents from women in ten rural communities of Anambra State. Questionnaire was used as instrument for data collection. The study found among others that Igbo radio campaign in Sapientia Radio, Onitsha, tagged ""kill mosquito, stop Malaria"" has really helped in reducing the incidences of malaria attack among women in Anambra state who now adopt preventive strategies against malaria as emphasized in the campaign. The reason for this seems to be the use of indigenous language in creating awareness through the campaign.

Herein we report data from the KP-led Princess PrEP program serving men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Thailand. Methods: From January 2016 to December 2017, trained MSM and TGW community health workers delivered same-day PrEP service in community health centres, allowing clients to receive one PrEP bottle to start on the day of HIV-negative testing. Visits were scheduled at Months 1 and 3, and every 3 months thereafter. Uptake, retention and adherence to PrEP services and changes in risk behaviours over time are reported. Results: Of 1467 MSM and 230 TGW who started PrEP, 44.1% had had condomless sex in the past 3 months. At Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12, retention was 74.2%, 64.0%, 56.2%, 46.7% and 43.9% respectively (lower in TGW than MSM at all visits; P < 0.001), with adherence to at least four PrEP pills per week self-reported by 97.4%, 96.8%, 96.5%, 97.5% and 99.5% of respondents respectively (no difference between MSM and TGW). Logistic regression analysis identified age >25 years, being MSM and having at least a Bachelors degree significantly increased retention. Condomless sex did not change over the 12-month period (from 47.2% to 45.2%; P = 0.20). New syphilis was diagnosed in 4.9% and 3.0% of PrEP clients at Months 6 and 12 (cf. 7.0% at baseline; P = 0.007). Among PrEP adherers and non-adherers, there were one and six HIV cases of seroconversion respectively, which resulted in corresponding HIV incidence rates (95% confidence interval) of 0.27 (0.04-1.90) and 1.36 (0.61-3.02) per 100 person-years. Conclusion: Our KP-led PrEP program successfully delivered PrEP to MSM and TGW. Innovative retention supports are needed, especially for TGW and those who are young or with lower education levels. To scale-up and sustain KP-led PrEP programs, strong endorsement from international and national guidelines is necessary.",2018,,Sexual Health (Online),15,6,542-555,2138996117,https://doi.org/10.1071/SH18065,,#159,Phanuphak 2018,"",""

Potential adverse effects of botanical supplementation in high-fat-fed female mice,"Fuller, Scott; Yu, Yongmei; Mendoza, Tamra; Ribnicky, David M; Cefalu, William T; Floyd, Z Elizabeth","Background Insulin resistance underlies metabolic syndrome and is associated with excess adiposity and visceral fat accumulation, which is more frequently observed in males than females. However, in young females, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is rising, mainly driven by accumulation of abdominal visceral fat. The degree to which sex-related differences could influence the development of insulin resistance remains unclear, and studies of potential therapeutic strategies to combat metabolic syndrome using rodent models have focused predominantly on males. We therefore evaluated the effects of two nutritional supplements derived from botanical sources, an extract of Artemisia dracunculus L. (termed PMI5011) and Momordica charantia (commonly known as bitter melon), on female mice challenged with a high-fat diet in order to determine if dietary intake of these supplements could ameliorate obesity-induced insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle.Methods Body composition, physical activity and energy expenditure, fatty acid oxidation, insulin signaling, and gene and protein expression of factors controlling lipid metabolism and ectopic lipid accumulation were evaluated in female mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with either PMI5011 or bitter melon. Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t test and repeated measures ANOVA.Results PMI5011 supplementation resulted in increased body weight and adiposity, while bitter melon did not induce changes in these parameters. Pyruvate tolerance testing indicated that both supplements increased hepatic glucose production. Both supplements induced a significant suppression in fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle homogenates treated with pyruvate, indicating enhanced metabolic flexibility. PMI5011 reduced lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle, while bitter melon induced a downward trend in lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle and liver. This was accompanied by transcriptional regulation of autophagic genes by bitter melon in the liver.Conclusions Data from the current study indicates that dietary supplementation with PMI5011 and bitter melon evokes a divergent, and generally less favorable, set of metabolic responses in female mice compared to effects previously observed in males. Our findings underscore the importance of considering sex-related variations in responses to dietary supplementation aimed at combating metabolic syndrome.",2018,,Biology of Sex Differences,9,,,2109054548,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-018-0199-1,,#161,Fuller 2018,"",""
An Intersectional Analysis of the Workplace Experiences of African American Female Athletic Directors,"Mcdowell, Jacqueline; Carter-francique, Akilah","Using intersectionality theory as a lens, the present study investigated the organizational experiences of African American women athletic directors.

Issues such as teen marriage, gender based violence, funding, and infrastructure will be discussed. Alternatives to address these issues will be compared, focusing heavily on what the Guinean population can accomplish themselves, without generous help from the outside. Solutions to this problem include addressing the cultural bias against putting girls in school, eradicating gender based violence, bettering infrastructure deficiencies, and increasing female role models.

One of the major efforts was the decision taken at the United Nations (UN) Millennium Summit in September 2000 where the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was adopted as a framework for the continents development strategy. This agenda is to provide all the developing countries of Africa the prospect and motivation to reduce poverty and reverse the deterioration in human developments. Since the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs have become important tools of monitoring and evaluating progress across nations. The eight time-bound goals are aimed at achieving the following by 2015: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV&AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development. Consequently, African countries have shown their commitments through a number of initiatives. Interestingly, since the adoption of MDGs 16 years ago, even with the recent adoption of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), evidence has shown that little success has been made in this regard.

Results showed improved women's status across the countries with increased proportion of women involved in decision making as well as women who do not justify wife beating. The decomposition models showed that, changes in fertility were due to changes in women's status as well as changes in the background characteristics. The first model showed that the explained changes in fertility largely resulted from women's perception of gender role attitudes compared to women's involvement in household decision making. The second model also showed similar results.

Job Insecurity and Turnover Intentions: Gender Differences and the Mediating Role of Work Engagement,"Metin Camgoz, Selin; Tayfur Ekmekci, Ozge; Bayhan Karapinar, Pinar; Kumbul Guler, Burcu","The present study tests an integrative model that considers differential gender effects for the mediating role of work engagement on the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intentions in a predominantly Muslim country. Job insecurity was divided into two aspects: general concerns about losing one's job and concerns about losing the privileges (such as career advancement, stimulating work, competence, and pay development) that come from one's specific job. Data were collected from 309 private banking employees (107 women, 202 men, with a mean age of 33.58) in Marmara region, Turkey. The results of multi-group path analysis partially support the hypotheses. The differential gender effects for the mediating effect of work engagement were supported only on the concerns about losing job privileges[arrow right]turnover intention linkage, but not on the concerns about losing the job itself[arrow right]turnover intention linkage. Moreover, the mediating effect of work engagement on the relationship between concerns about losing job privileges and turnover intention was found to be stronger for women than for men. For men, work engagement acts only as a partial mediator, suggesting that concerns about the loss of job privileges exerts its effects on turnover intentions both directly and indirectly. Although the direct effect of concerns about losing the job itself on turnover intention is significant, the indirect effect through work engagement turns out to be nonsignificant for both genders.

With more female enrolment in schools, from primary to higher institutions, it is expected that the old system would pave way for equal opportunity to address sustainable development holistically in Africa. Poverty, unemployment, ignorance, religion and culture are the major obstacles to women empowerment. These social issues have an effect upon health development; they aggravate mortality rate despite government focus on primary health care (PHC) as agreed through the Alma Ata Declaration in Kazakhstan.

A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSFORMING AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES THROUGH STUDENT AFFAIRS PROGRAMS,"Heaven, Anthony","It is widely known and publicized that African American males have significant struggles within the realm of higher education. With lower attendance, retention, and graduation rates that most other demographics, African American Males are significantly behind the curve of education. Within the student affairs, there are certain programs and initiatives that should be implemented to help alleviate some of the adjustment issues that African American males encounter in higher education. This paper will explore the conceptual nature of these initiatives and illustrate how they function utilizing the African American Male Research Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin as an example; it will evaluate how the programs can transform the students' perspectives while increasing retention rates and graduation rates. Institutions must establish counseling mandates, cultivate student leadership/involvement, create mentoring programs, and improve career-counseling services. All of the above programs are components of student affairs that can be implemented in order to help transform African American males and promote their success in and outside of higher education.",2015,,"Race, Gender & Class",22,1/2,54-64,1757044909,,,#182,Heaven 2015,"",""
Adherence to Malaria Treatment during Pregnancy: Do Availability and Utilization of Medical facilities translate to Compliance?,"Nwokocha, Ezebunwa E","Malaria is a major health issue in sub-Saharan Africa with pregnant women and children at greater risk of exposure to the disease than other population cohorts. Studies on malaria related maternal mortality in Nigeria have focused largely on preventive behaviour and healthcare providers' knowledge of treatment regimen. Negligible attention has been paid to adherence of care seekers to treatment in relevant contexts. Employing the cross-sectional survey method, 927 pregnant women in Ondo state, Southwest Nigeria were selected through a multistage sampling technique. In addition, 12 In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted among relevant stakeholders. Results showed that adherence to malaria treatment among pregnant women was influenced by social, residential and demographic factors in both rural and urban areas of the state. Expectant mothers without formal education reported higher level of adherence to medication (r=-631 p< .034) than those of higher educational status, indicating that the level of education does not necessarily influence adherence to medication. Policy and national programmes aimed at maternal mortality reduction should recognise the important role that culture plays in people's perception and behaviour and by implication, aetiology of diseases. Without a feasible, people-oriented and context-specific intervention, malaria induced maternal morbidity and mortality will remain high not only in Ondo State but Nigeria in general.",2014,,Gender & Behaviour,12,2,6329-6340,1657548468,,,#183,Nwokocha 2014,"",""
Female business faculty attrition: paths through the labyrinth,Amy Klemm Verbos; De Vee E. Dykstra,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore female business faculty perceptions about attrition from a business school to uncover factors that might assist in female faculty retention in business schools. Design/methodology/approach - Using a qualitative study approach and guided by past literature, the paper systematically analyses open-ended responses to interview questions and notes emergent themes. Findings - The major themes that emerged as factors leading to attrition: first, an exclusionary and managerialist culture which marginalized and demoralized women; second, curtailed career opportunities, including a lack of gender equity in promotion and tenure; third, poor leadership; and fourth, break up of a critical mass of women. The factors then that might assist in female faculty retention are a critical mass of women, gender equity, inclusive, collaborative cultures, psychological safety, and ethical leadership. The career patterns of the women indicated that a labyrinth is an apt metaphor for their career paths. Research limitations/implications - This research examines just one school from the perspective of women who left. It holds promise as the basis for future studies across business schools and to faculty within business schools to determine whether the emergent themes hold across schools.

This cross-sectional design study utilized 2008 NDHS dataset and focused on married women aged 15-49 years (n=20,009) in stable union. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, binary and multinomial logistic regression models (α=.05). The mean age of the women was 31.0 ± 8.7years, 32.7% have CGP among which 23.7% have son preference. The GSP for son was predominantly high among women in the; South-East (46.0%), rich wealth index (26.8%) and secondary level of education (28.8%). Age, region, residence, education, sex composition of the living children, religion, ethnicity, marriage type, wealth index, current work activity, media exposure and family planning media exposure were significantly associated with CGP and GSP (p<0.05). After controlling for potential confounding factors, the likelihood of CGP was 0.69(C.I=0.61-0.78; p<0.001), 1.87(C.I=1.55-2.25; p<0.001), 1.64(C.I= 1.47-1.84; p<0.001) and 0.81(C.I=0.70-0.93; p<0.01) among women in North-West, South-East, South-South and South-West respectively when0 compared with their counterparts in North-Central.

"Influences on visit retention in clinical trials: Insights from qualitative research during the VOICE trial in Johannesburg, South Africa","Magazi, Busisiwe; Stadler, Jonathan; Delany-Moretlwe, Sinead; Montgomery, Elizabeth; Mathebula, Florence; Hartmann, Miriam; van der Straten, Ariane","Doc number: 88AbstractBackground: Although significant progress has been made in clinical trials of women-controlled methods of HIV prevention such as microbicides and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), low adherence to experimental study products remains a major obstacle to being able to establish their efficacy in preventing HIV infection. One factor that influences adherence is the ability of trial participants to attend regular clinic visits at which trial products are dispensed, adherence counseling is administered, and participant safety is monitored. We conducted a qualitative study of the social contextual factors that influenced adherence in the VOICE (MTN-003) trial in Johannesburg, South Africa, focusing on study participation in general, and study visits in particular.Methods: The research used qualitative methodologies, including in-depth interviews (IDI), serial ethnographic interviews (EI), and focus group discussions (FGD) among a random sub-sample of 102 female trial participants, 18 to 40 years of age. A socio-ecological framework that explored those factors that shaped trial participation and adherence to study products, guided the analysis. Key codes were developed to standardize subsequent coding and a node search was used to identify texts relating to obstacles to visit adherence. Our analysis includes coded transcripts from seven FGD (N = 40), 41 IDI, and 64 serial EI (N = 21 women).Results: Women's kinship, social, and economic roles shaped their ability to participate in the clinical trial. Although participants expressed strong commitments to attend study visits, clinic visit schedules and lengthy waiting times interfered with their multiple obligations as care givers, wage earners, housekeepers, and students.Conclusions: The research findings highlight the importance of the social context in shaping participation in HIV prevention trials, beyond focusing solely on individual characteristics.

Yet, it is important for researchers to also be aware of and draw insights from common patterns in the experiences of women across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Here, we review studies on gender disparities across college STEM on measures that have been correlated with retention. These include disparities in academic performance, engagement, self-efficacy, belonging, and identity. We argue that observable factors such as persistence, performance, and engagement can inform researchers about what populations are disadvantaged in a STEM classroom or program, but we need to measure underlying mechanisms to understand how these inequalities arise. We present a framework that helps connect larger sociocultural factors, including stereotypes and gendered socialization, to student affect and observable behaviors in STEM contexts. We highlight four mechanisms that demonstrate how sociocultural factors could impact women in STEM classrooms and majors.

Gender Diversity in Computer Science at a Large Public R1 Research University: Reporting on a Self-study,"Babe-Vroman, Monica; Nguyen, Thuytien N.; Nguyen, Thu D.","With the number of jobs in computer occupations on the rise, there is a greater need for computer science (CS) graduates than ever. At the same time, most CS departments across the country are only seeing 25-30% of women students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, a large public R1 research university, using three data sets that span thousands of students across six academic years. Specifically, we combine these data sets to study the gender gaps in four core CS courses and explore the correlation of several factors with retention and the impact of these factors on changes to the gender gap as students proceed through the CS courses toward completing the CS major. For example, we find that a significant percentage of women students taking the introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which may be a contributing factor to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that part of the retention task is attracting these women students to further explore the major. Results from our study include both novel findings and findings that are consistent with known challenges for increasing gender diversity in CS. In both cases, we provide extensive quantitative data in support of the findings. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",2022,,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,22,2,,,10.1145/3471572,,#188,Babe-Vroman 2022,"",""

Increasing Women's Participation in CS at Large Public Universities: Issues and Insights,"Rezwana, Jeba; Maher, Mary Lou","Despite rapidly growing interest in Computer Science (CS), CS has the second lowest participation rate for women of all science and engineering degrees, according to a recent report by the US National Science Board [16]. The reasons for women's underrepresentation and their experiences may differ from university to university. Universities are very different in terms of types of students, student profiles, students' socio-economic status, race, number of students, admission requirements, and resources. For example, some universities can create gender balance in introductory courses through selective admission. However, typically, admission practices in large public universities are not able to achieve gender balance for CS majors. As a result, there are lower percentages of women in the CS major in large public universities than in selective schools. In addition, large public universities tend to have a larger number of CS students when compared to private universities. To understand women students' experiences and struggles in computer science at a large public university in the United States and to find ways to intervene in favor of gender equity in computer science, we conducted in-depth interviews with women students in introductory programming courses. In this article, we present women students' experiences, struggles, expectations and offer potential interventions based on the findings to encourage women to consider CS as their major and stay in the CS major. Our interview data shows there is a persistent effect of lack of prior programming experience and gender bias that leads to a negative experience for women students in introductory CS courses.

Online learning in COVID-19 pandemic: an empirical study of Indian and Turkish higher education institutions,"Churi, P.; Mistry, K.; Asad, M.M.; Dhiman, G.; Soni, M.; Kose, U.","Purpose Online learning is essential in today's world. The COVID-19 has resulted in shutting down all the universities across the globe. Countries like India and Turkey (lower-income countries) are suffering a lot in giving the best classroom practice to their students through online mode. The entire way of teaching-learning has changed drastically, and it is a need of an hour. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. It is therefore important to understand from student's perspectives about learning online. The paper systematically surveys the perception of learning online for Indian and Turkan students. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this goal, 594 samples of students (from India and Turkey country) have been taken into considerations, and through statistical measures, the results were analyzed. The set of four research questions comprising of effect of study on COVID-19 pandemic, perception of learning online in COVID-19 pandemic, perception of different genders in learning online and perception of Indians over Turkan students in learning online were analyzed through statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation and so on. Findings The descriptive statistics of various responses across various dimensions (gender, country) reveals that there is no effect in learning online as compared to classroom-based teaching. On the other hand, there is no significant difference in gender and country in learning online. Originality/value Online learning has become crucial in higher education as far as pandemic situation is concerned. Many higher education institutions across different countries are suffering various problems from student point of view.

The survey results show that both genders view male geoscientists as substantially more gender biased than female scientists. Moreover, female geoscientists are more than twice as likely to experience negative gender bias at their workplaces and scientific organizations compared to male geoscientists. There are also pronounced gender differences regarding (i) the relevance of role models, (ii) family-friendly working conditions, and (iii) the approval of gender quotas for academic positions.

Not feeling recognized as a physics person by instructors and teaching assistants is correlated with female students' lower grades,"Cwik, S.; Singh, C.","Student motivational beliefs in introductory physics courses can influence their course outcomes as well as their retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines and future career aspirations. Prior research has shown that students' perceived recognition by others as a physics person is important in predicting their physics identity and career choices. This study used validated survey data from 827 students in the first of two college algebra-based introductory physics courses primarily taken by bioscience majors, in which women make up approximately 67% of the class. We investigated how the students' perceived recognition by instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) as a physics person predicts their grade at the end of a mandatory physics course for bioscience majors in which women are not outnumbered by men. We found that overall women had lower perceived recognition than men as a physics person and their perceived recognition played an important role in predicting course grades controlling for high school GPA and math SAT scores. Since physics as a discipline presents a barrier to women due to deep-rooted societal stereotypes and biases about who can excel in it, the numerical representation of women alone in these courses does not imply that they will feel recognized by their instructors and TAs as a physics person without an intentional effort to make the learning environment equitable and inclusive.

"Effect of gender, self-efficacy, and interest on perception of the learning environment and outcomes in calculus-based introductory physics courses","Yangqiuting Li; Singh, C.","Students’ motivational beliefs about physics can influence their learning outcomes as well as retention in their majors and career choices. Moreover, due to societal stereotypes and biases about who belongs in physics and can succeed in physics, women often have lower motivational beliefs about physics than men. The expectancy-value theory emphasizes the importance of self-efficacy and value in predicting students’ short- and long-term academic and professional outcomes, but there are few studies focusing on how the learning environment shapes these motivational beliefs of women and men. Investigating how the perception of learning environment in introductory physics courses for the engineering, physical science, and mathematics majors in their first year of college predicts the motivational beliefs of women and men can be useful in making the learning environments equitable and inclusive so that the underrepresented students, e.g., women, are not disadvantaged. In this study, we adapt prior identity framework to investigate how the learning environment (including sense of belonging, perceived peer interaction, and perceived recognition) predicts students’ physics self-efficacy, interest, and identity by controlling for their self-efficacy and interest at the beginning of a calculus-based introductory physics course. We surveyed 1203 students, 35% of whom identified as women. We found signatures of inequitable and noninclusive learning environment in that not only were female students’ physics self-efficacy and interest lower than male students’ at the beginning of the course, but the gender gaps in these motivational constructs became even larger by the end of the course. Analysis revealed that the decrease in students’ physics self-efficacy and interest were mediated by the learning environment and predicted students’ physics identity.

Gender Diversity in STEM Disciplines: A Multiple Factor Problem,"Botella, C.; Rueda, S.; Lopez-Inesta, E.; Marzal, P.","Lack of diversity, and specifically, gender diversity, is one of the key problems that both technological companies and academia are facing these days. Moreover, recent studies show that the number of female students enrolled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines have been decreasing in the last twenty years, while the number of women resigning from technological job positions remains unacceptably high. As members of a higher education institution, we foresee that working towards increasing and retaining the number of female students enrolled in STEM disciplines can help to alleviate part of the challenges faced by women in STEM fields. In this paper, we first review the main barriers and challenges that women encounter in their professional STEM careers through different age stages. Next, we focus on the special case of the information theory field, discussing the potential of gendered innovation, and whether it can be applied in the Information Theory case.

Closing the gap between the percentage of nonwhite workers, women, and other underrepresented groups in the higher education IT workforce and the percentage in the US labor force would help alleviate the higher education staffing challenges. But to close this gap, colleges and universities need more effective approaches to not only recruitment but also retention of diverse employee populations. Moving forward to recruit a diverse workforce without having an effective retention strategy is like trying to fill a leaky bucket.",2018,05/,EDUCAUSE Review,53,3,26-8,,,,#205,Woo 2018,"",""
Sources of gender differences in competency beliefs and retention in an introductory premedical science course,"Witherspoon, Eben B.; Schunn, Christian D.","Gender disparities in retention in pathways to science continue to vary widely by course. Undergraduates intending to study prehealth and premedicine often represent a majority of students enrolled in introductory science courses, contribute to a large number of eventual science degree earners, and are a population that typically includes a high number of women. However, gender differences in attrition, grades, and attitudes persist in the introductory science courses required by undergraduate preheath and premedical programs, particularly within the physical sciences (i.e., Chemistry and Physics). We use structural equation modeling to study 416 undergraduate students across multiple sections of an Algebra-based Physics course, a common course on the prehealth and premedical track where large gender differences in grades, retention and competency beliefs have been documented. Our analysis focuses on identifying potential academic and attitudinal sources for gender differences in students' beliefs about their Physics abilities at the end of the course, and retention to the second physics course, which is often influenced by these competency beliefs. Results suggest that while men's ability beliefs in Physics are relatively stable and largely derived from early performance indicators, this is a smaller source of ability beliefs for women. Instead, women's ability beliefs are mediated during the course through their sense of belonging in Physics, and the extent to which they believe that Physics ability is fixed or malleable. These findings can inform the design of interventions in Physics courses that specifically target the development of ability beliefs for women intending medical careers. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.",2022,,Journal of Research in Science Teaching,59,5,695-719,,10.1002/tea.21741,,#206,Witherspoon 2022,"",""
Illuminating the Role of Classmates in Reducing the Participation Gender Gap in Lecture-Based Engineering Classes,"Dutta, Nikita S.; Arnold, Craig B.","Contribution: This work sheds light on how classmate behaviors influence gender gaps in verbal participation in lecture-based engineering classes. It is found that after a woman participates in class, there is a temporarily increased likelihood a woman will participate again afterward. Background: Women continue to be underrepresented in STEM higher education, particularly in engineering. Positive classroom experiences are key to retaining women undergraduates, but despite research into the value of interactive teaching that allows classmates to aid each other's learning, lecturing is still most common in collegiate STEM classrooms. Research Questions: This study considers how classmates influence gender gaps in student verbal participation, even during traditional lecturing. Methodology: One thousand and three hundred and eighty seven student comments are observed over 89 class periods in ten engineering courses. The variation in student verbal participation levels with gender is analyzed, and its correlation with student speaking order, as well as other factors related to the classroom structure, is investigated. Findings: A statistically significant gender gap in class participation is observed, which is not fully explained by factors like class size or comment type. It is found, however, that when one woman participates, it increases the likelihood a woman will participate afterward, pointing to the role of classmates. This trend and the participation gender gap overall are eliminated when isolating classes taught by women. These results suggest that hearing either a woman classmate or instructor speak in class makes other women more likely to do so. As participation is linked to everything from student performance to confidence, this provides an avenue to increase gender equity in classroom experiences through small pedagogical changes that can be readily implemented into traditional lecturing. © 2022 IEEE.",2022,,IEEE Transactions on Education,65,4,584-591,,10.1109/TE.2022.3151824,,#207,Dutta 2022,"",""
Overstaying our welcome: On the rise of women's seniority in the academy,"Stadnyk, T.A.","Issues surrounding gender equality are—and should be—front and centre in the water resources community, and other science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Very necessarily, the focus tends to be on recruitment, offering support for students and early career academics. The leaky pipeline concept used to describe the incremental loss of women from STEM fields with career duration describes a disproportionate loss of senior women, creating a parallel problem where highly qualified, top tier academics are lost from the system after significant financial and personnel investment by institutions. Ultimately, the leaky pipeline undermines the extensive investment of the hydrology and other STEM communities in equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) recruitment and retention programmes by cutting short career ambitions and the trajectories of diverse top performing individuals, resulting in no net benefit of EDIA policy investments and a lack of diversity with seniority. Addressing this critical gender gap requires the attention and support of the hydrology community of practice with specific focus on generating opportunities for advancement, confronting systemic and structural biases and improving education around allyship. Institutions and professional organizations need to consciously grow diversity in leadership and recognize and outwardly manage the perception of academic excellence around slow research and education that attracts increased diversity. Supporting allyship, reducing competitiveness among community members and reinforcing collaboration will not only attract, but retain, a higher proportion of diversity in the hydrology community, academia and STEM professions in general. It is time for the water resources (and other STEM) communities to demand broader accountability and recognition of the barriers to women, implement and reward more diverse definitions of research excellence, and offer allyship training to the community of practice at large. © 2024 The Authors.

Female undergraduate stem persistence: a focus on the role of living and learning communities,"Nix, S.; Roberts, K.L.; Hughes, R.M.","Despite multiple policy changes over the last three decades, women are still underrepresented in many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at the undergraduate level. This issue is a major policy concern for federal and state governments as well as higher education institutions. Colleges and universities have created a number of recruitment and retention policies to address women's underrepresentation in STEM fields. One of the longest running responses has been living-learning communities (LLCs) - programs designed to provide safe places for women to network and meet role models who can help them through their respective STEM courses and disciplinary climates. This study investigates how participation in a STEM LLC at one university relates to college and STEM-related educational outcomes by comparing participants to matched (via propensity score matching) STEM majors in the institution's general population. We found that WISE students were about 40% more likely than their non-WISE counterparts to graduate from college. WISE students were three times more likely to complete physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences degrees than non-WISE students. This finding is important since these majors have shown the most persistent gender disparities over time in the U.S. In conclusion, this study highlights the positive relationship between participation in a single-sex STEM LLC on women's persistence in PEMC majors. Therefore, this study suggests that women-only STEM LLC's may be a valuable piece of the answer to improving the representation of women in the PEMC majors.",2016,/,Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering,22,4,349-71,,,,#211,Nix 2016,"",""
"Differences in the self-perceptions of resilience, grit, and persistence among first-year engineering undergraduates","Moreno-Hernandez, Amanda D.; Mondisa, Joi-Lynn","There is a significant demand for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates to meet impending workforce needs. However, some research studies seem to indicate that academic and personal challenges deter students from persisting toward degree completion. Resilience and grit are often seen as critical attributes to counter these challenges. By understanding the roles of resilience, grit, and persistence in engineering undergraduates' experiences, institutions can develop, implement, and improve mechanisms that assist in student retention. This work examines the potential differences in the self-perceptions of resilience, grit, and persistence among first-year engineering undergraduates. For this study, we developed an online survey compiled from existing validated scales and administered the survey to first-year engineering undergraduates at a large Midwestern university. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on a sample of 167 students to determine differences between groups based on sex, grade point average, race, and citizenship. Results indicate that students' resilience and grit may extend beyond their academic experiences. There were also differences among participants' self-perceptions across race and sex when evaluating self-assessment of resilience and among citizenship status when evaluating grit. However, there was no statistical significance found when evaluating persistence contrary to findings from other studies. Additional qualitative research (e.g., interviews) is recommended to understand additional underlying factors of these findings. This study warrants the need for institutions to collectively address the role of resilience, grit, and persistence in the experiences of first-year engineering undergraduates. As a result, this work may assist in identifying strategies that help address the needs of engineering students and support their matriculation into the STEM workforce. © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.",2021,,International Journal of Engineering Education,37,3,701-711,,,,#212,Moreno-Hernandez 2021,"",""

Gender & Self-Efficacy: A Call to Physics Educators,"Henderson, R.; Sawtelle, V.; Nissen, J.M.","Many students across the United States enter college with aspirations of becoming a successful career scientist within the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded in physics has significantly lagged behind the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded in the other STEM disciplines. Of the physics bachelor’s degrees awarded nationally in 2014, only 20% were conferred to women. As a part of the conversation on recruitment, retention, and diversity in physics, researchers have focused on students’ self-efficacy (SE), or one’s personal beliefs in their capabilities to execute a specific task. Self-efficacy is highly correlated with performance and success, career aspirations, and student persistence, particularly in physics. In addition, many studies have shown that men and women evaluate their science SE differently with women, on average, reporting a lower SE toward science. This article will provide a robust literature review about the research reporting on the gender differences in science SE, specifically within the physics discipline. We will highlight common resources educators can use to measure students’ SE in their own physics classrooms, the standard findings that SE decreases in introductory physics courses but not in other science courses, and within physics the decreases tend to be larger for female students.",2020,05/,Physics Teacher,58,5,345-8,,10.1119/1.5145533,,#214,Henderson 2020,"",""

Keeping women in systems engineering: gender dynamics in the field,"Palmer, Erika","The representation of women in systems engineering is very low, which indicates that the field is not utilizing the best possible talent.

The dynamics of this push-pull relationship have yet to be investigated operationally. This study addresses this research gap with a system dynamics model illustrating how women are attracted to and repelled from engineering careers. Because system engineers are found in all engineering disciplines, the model focuses on engineering in general. The results indicate that the success of K-12 initiatives does not continue into university education.

Self-efficacy of engineering students at a South African university-findings from a longitudinal study,"Lourens, Ann S.; Pannell, Liesl S.","Internationally and nationally, governments, professional body organisations and higher education institutions and are launching initiatives to attract and retain women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) fields. This article reports on the fourth phase in a longitudinal study aimed at determining the levels of self-efficacy of first-year engineering students at a South African university. It further reports on the impact of co-curricular interventions, presented as a leadership development programme (LDP), that was developed to assist women engineering students (WES) belonging to the Women in Engineering Leadership Association (WELA) to improve their feelings of self-efficacy. It was proposed that these interventions could contribute to WELA members outgrowing their perceived insecurities and negative perceptions and result in well-balanced, self-assured and effective WES, and, in turn, women engineer employees. Participation in and completion of the LDP could thereby improve the retention of women in the field of engineering. To measure the self-efficacy of engineering students, the Self-Efficacy Instrument for Engineering Students (SEIES) was developed. The instrument measured students' perceived motivation and confidence relative to nine identified subscales. The findings of the study indicated no significant differences in the self-efficacy of male engineering students (MES), WES and WELA members, even though the results indicated that WELA members scored slightly higher on most of the subscales measured. Based on this study, it became evident that specifically-designed developmental programmes such as WELA could have a positive influence on the self-efficacy of WES.

The unequal impact of parenthood in academia,"Morgan, Allison C.; Way, Samuel F.; Hoefer, Michael J.D.; Larremore, Daniel B.; Galesic, Mirta; Clauset, Aaron","Across academia, men and women tend to publish at unequal rates. Existing explanations include the potentially unequal impact of parenthood on scholarship, but a lack of appropriate data has prevented its clear assessment. Here, we quantify the impact of parenthood on scholarship using an extensive survey of the timing of parenthood events, longitudinal publication data, and perceptions of research expectations among 3064 tenure-track faculty at 450 Ph.D.-granting computer science, history, and business departments across the United States and Canada, along with data on institution-specific parental leave policies. Parenthood explains most of the gender productivity gap by lowering the average short-term productivity of mothers, even as parents tend to be slightly more productive on average than nonparents. However, the size of productivity penalty for mothers appears to have shrunk over time. Women report that paid parental leave and adequate childcare are important factors in their recruitment and retention.

Women are under-represented in soil science leadership positions. Women receive SSSA awards at lower rates than their participation in the society. Women face attrition more than men as they advance the soil science career ladder. Diversity and inclusion are important pathways to grow and innovate soil science. The soil science discipline has undergone significant changes since its establishment in the 1900s; from strong connections with agronomy to a broader focus on ecosystems, earth, and environmental sciences while also during this period experiencing a notable increase in diversity among soil scientists. In this review, we explore soil science from the perspective of gender demographics and disciplinary foci of soil scientists. We examine graduate student enrollment metrics; employment information in academia, the federal government, and the private sector; and membership data from SSSA to gain deeper insight into these changes and the implications for the future of soil science. Women earn nearly half of the advanced soil science degrees. The number of women pursuing soil science careers has also increased, albeit less markedly, as women now comprise 24, 26, and 20% of the soil scientists in academic faculty positions, federal agencies, and private industry, respectively. However, there is reason for concern that women linger in intermediate levels of employment, and further attrition occurs along the career ladder with only ∼18% of the highest employment levels held by women; even fewer reach executive leadership levels in any sector. The growing participation of women in soil science is further reflected in a nearly 45% increase in female membership and meeting attendance in SSSA over the past decade, but recognition of their accomplishments and their presence in SSSA leadership positions remains low. We provide recommendations toward greater inclusion and gender diversity as this represents an important pathway to grow and innovate our science. © 2019 The Authors.",2019,,Soil Science Society of America Journal,83,5,1278-1289,,10.2136/sssaj2019.03.0085,,#221,Vaughan 2019,"",""

Subjects included seven career women physicists with master's degrees in physics and doctorates in physics-related fields. The influences of psychological and social variables were evaluated to generate theories on proposed strategies for inclusiveness. Various latent constructs related to career interest and retention were identified, including early interest in physics and mathematics, recognition of the societal value of physics, and positive experiences with role models. Tensions in their career pathways were related to pervasive feelings of inadequacy, lack of social support, negative stereotypes, awareness of minority status, and struggles with work-life balance.

While existing literature gives insights into factors shaping retention and progression in university engineering students, comparatively less is known about the development of primary and secondary school students' engineering aspirations. Purpose: This paper contrasts science and engineering analyses to explore how relationships between background and attitudinal factors and aspirations change across primary and secondary schools. We examine the relative influence of gender on aspirations in both science and engineering. Design/Method: We drew on survey data from more than 20,000 English students from the ASPIRES projects. A multilevel regression approach is implemented to test for the effects of gender, ethnicity, and cultural capital on science and engineering aspirations. Results: Gender is the main factor related to engineering aspirations, while science aspirations are influenced by a broader range of factors. School-level factors become increasingly important for engineering aspirations. We also report evidence of the early distinctiveness of young women who aspire to engineering in terms of their relatively high self-concept and motivations. Conclusions: The association of engineering with masculinity is evident in aspirations from age 10, and students aspiring to engineering are distinctive in several respects.

Using Team-Based Learning to Promote Engineering Students' Performance and Self-Efficacy in a Technical Writing Class,"Shenghua Zha; Shenghua Wu; Estis, J.M.","Introduction: Technical writing is an essential skill set for engineering students. Many studies have been conducted, but very few have used experimental or quasiexperimental design to identify an optimal instructional method in a technical writing class. Situating the case: Team-based learning (TBL) is a well-structured learning method that prior studies have found to enhance students' academic performance. TBL includes individual and collaborative learning activities from lower to higher cognitive levels. Peer leadership, as evidenced in other studies, uses appointed student leaders to promote equal and active group participation and shows a potential to solve the gender issue found in engineering class collaborations. About the case: In this case, we infused peer leadership in TBL in three technical writing sessions of an engineering lab class. Appointed student leaders were responsible for initiating and sustaining discussions, asking each group member's input, and seeking collective decisions on solutions. The other class used traditional TBL activities. Methods/approach: Nonparametric analyses were conducted to compare students' technical writing skills and self-efficacy, as well as gender differences in two classes. Results/discussion: Students in the peer-led TBL class showed better technical writing skill retention than their counterparts in the traditional TBL class. The gender difference was identified in the traditional TBL class. However, we did not find any difference in students' self-efficacy between the peer-led and traditional TBL sections, though both observed a significant improvement at the end. Conclusions: We suggest studies with large sample sizes and equal distribution of female and male students.",2021,/,IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,64,4,456-67,,10.1109/TPC.2021.3110619,,#234,ShenghuaZha 2021,"",""
Developing an Innovative Sustainable Science Education Ecosystem: Lessons from Negative Impacts of Inequitable and Non-Inclusive Learning Environments,"Cwik, S.; Singh, C.","Societal stereotypes and biases about who belongs in science courses and who can excel in them can impact short- and long-term outcomes of students from marginalized groups, e.g., women, including their grades and beliefs about science as well as retention in science disciplines. Therefore, developing a sustainable science education ecosystem requires fostering equitable and inclusive learning environments in which students from all demographic groups have comparable outcomes. Here we describe a study with more than five hundred students in an introductory physics course at a large research university in the US that investigated female and male students' perceptions of the inclusiveness of the learning environment (including their sense of belonging, perceived recognition by others such as instructors, and perceived effectiveness of peer interaction) and how it predicted their physics course grades, self-efficacy, interest, and identity at the end of the course. We find gender differences in perceptions of the inclusiveness of the learning environment disadvantaging female students and that these perceptions played a major role in explaining student outcomes. These inequitable trends in the context of physics can be useful for contemplating how to develop an innovative sustainable science ecosystem using hands-on and minds-on science and create an equitable and inclusive learning environment to help all students excel in science.",2022,/,Sustainability,,,11345 (18 pp.),,10.3390/su141811345,,#236,Cwik 2022,"",""
Hybrid working from home improves retention without damaging performance,"Bloom, N.; Han, R.; Liang, J.","Working from home has become standard for employees with a university degree. The most common scheme, which has been adopted by around 100 million employees in Europe and North America, is a hybrid schedule, in which individuals spend a mix of days at home and at work each week1,2. However, the effects of hybrid working on employees and firms have been debated, and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development3-5. Here we ran a six-month randomized control trial investigating the effects of hybrid working from home on 1,612 employees in a Chinese technology company in 2021-2022. We found that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes. Null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working did not affect performance grades over the next two years of reviews. We found no evidence for a difference in promotions over the next two years overall, or for any major employee subgroup. Finally, null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working had no effect on the lines of code written by computer-engineer employees. We also found that the 395 managers in the experiment revised their surveyed views about the effect of hybrid working on productivity, from a perceived negative effect (−2.6% on average) before the experiment to a perceived positive one (+1.0%) after the experiment. These results indicate that a hybrid schedule with two days a week working from home does not damage performance.",2024,/,Nature,630,8018,920-5,,10.1038/s41586-024-07500-2,,#237,Bloom 2024,"",""
The roles of the protestant work ethic and perceived identity compatibility in graduate students’ feelings and attitudes toward stem and non-stem fields,"Shin, J.E.L.; Rosenthal, L.; Levy, S.R.; Lytle, A.; London, B.; Lobel, M.","In the United States, women’s underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and men's underrepresentation in non-STEM fields remain persistent disparities that hinder the full equality and participation of men and women in particular career domains. Research and theory aimed at identifying the factors that contribute to engagement and retention of these underrepresented groups is needed. Individuals use fundamentally held beliefs, such as the Protestant work ethic (PWE), to make sense of and respond to academic situations. Findings from 834 graduate students at the start and end of their first year revealed that among STEM women, PWE-Equalizer (belief that everyone has equal ability to succeed) had a positive and PWE-justifier (belief that people are responsible for their disadvantage) had a negative association with perceived identity compatibility and feelings and attitudes toward one's field; further, perceived identity compatibility mediated the associations of PWE-Equalizer and PWE-justifier with feelings and attitudes. Among non-STEM men, similar results held for PWE-Equalizer but less so for PWE-justifier. Among the majority groups (STEM men and non-STEM women), there was an inconsistent pattern in the associations among PWE, perceived identity compatibility, and feelings and attitudes, such that the associations were mostly not significant for these groups although some of the findings were similar to that of STEM women and nonSTEM men.

"Influential factors in customer satisfaction of transit services: Using crowdsourced data to capture the heterogeneity across individuals, space and time","Luo, Shuli; He, Sylvia Y.; Grant-Muller, Susan; Song, Linqi","In a rapidly evolving and highly competitive transportation market, increasing customer satisfaction and ridership retention are essential for transit agencies. Understanding how different market segments perceive transit services can help service providers to identify potential priority areas and develop specialised strategies to address their varying travel concerns. However, traditional studies have predominantly investigated the variations across socioeconomic cohorts or travel characteristics but ignored the complex effect of spatial, temporal, and user heterogeneity. Recently social media data has attracted growing interest from academia as an alternative way to compensate public attitude surveys with a high volume of semantic, spatial, and temporal information. This study collected 177,807 microblogs from Sina Weibo to understand how customer satisfaction varies among different market segments characterised by social, temporal, and spatial heterogeneity. Methodologically, this study applies sentiment analysis as a real-time measurement of customers' satisfaction towards transit services, covering safety, crowdedness, reliability, personnel behaviour, and comfort. A beta regression model is then applied to identify the most important explanatory factors and the extent to which explanatory factors affect customers' satisfaction, respectively. The result indicates that age, gender, travel mode, time, and space significantly contribute to customers’ satisfaction with the transit system. Their varying impacts on different service attributes are also identified in this study. This study also reveals the highly polarised nature of online sentiment, explaining gendered attitudes. Our research framework could be used as a benchmark for other service industries to conduct similar market segment analysis and integrate it into the policy decision process. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Transport Policy,131,,173-183,,10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.12.011,,#239,Luo 2023,"",""
Biotechnological Approaches to Enhancing English Vocabulary Teaching Across Chinese and Western Cultures Using Bio Corpus Technology,"Ben, Peidi; Ma, Kun","This paper explores the innovative application of bio corpus technology in enhancing English vocabulary teaching across Chinese and Western cultures in higher education. Initially, the study defines and categorizes semantic types and relations, outlining the critical steps in constructing a bio-corpus. The analysis then focuses on the differences in English vocabulary usage between Chinese and Western cultures, examining these variations through the lenses of life etiquette, gender, and emotional connotations to improve teaching methods. Further, the paper delves into the application of bio corpus technology in analyzing syntactic features relevant to English vocabulary instruction. By using bio-corpus to examine these features, the study confirms the effectiveness of this approach in comparison to traditional teaching methods. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in English vocabulary scores when utilizing bio corpus technology, with scores increasing from 39 to 58, a marked improvement over traditional methods. Additionally, in vocabulary mastery, while the meaning and lexical significance values were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), significant improvements were observed in collocation and utilization (p  © 2024, Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.

Vex robotics competitions: Gender differences in student attitudes and experiences,"Sullivan, Amanda; Bers, Marina Umaschi","Aim/Purpose Educational robotics competitions are a popular way to increase students' inter-est in science and engineering during their K-12 years. However, female stu-dents are typically underrepresented in these competitions. The goal of this study is to determine differences in the experiences of male and female robotics competition students in order to better support female students and increase their representation in competition leagues. Background VEX Robotics Competitions are one of the fastest-growing educational robot-ics competitions available to middle school and high school students around the world. Despite growing numbers of participants, VEX programs have a notice-able lack of female participants. In order to create a more diverse and repre-sentative program, it is important to investigate why fewer female students par-ticipate in the competitions and what can be done to better support female stu-dents. Methodology Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from VEX mentors and stu-dents through online surveys. A total sample of N=675 VEX mentors and stu-dents participated (n=47 students and n=628 mentors). The surveys asked scaled, multiple choice, and free response questions. Through these surveys, the following research questions are answered: 1) What (if any) are the differences between male and female student experiences with VEX? 2) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' confidence in their technical ability? and 3) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' perfor-mance on VEX related robotics team tasks?

Motivations to Leave Engineering: Through a Lens of Social Responsibility,"Rulifson, Greg; Bielefeldt, Angela","Engineering should include concern for people, communities, and societal welfare at the heart of the profession. Focusing on these helping attributes of engineering may help draw individuals, particularly women, into the field. However, are prosocially motivated individuals leaving engineering during college due to the lack of social responsibility (SR) typically portrayed in their education? Understanding more about students’ reasons for leaving in relation to perceived social responsibilities through their careers can help fill this literature gap. Thirty-four students initially majoring in engineering participated in a qualitative study of SR in engineering. Among this cohort, 7 of 14 women motivated to help people/society through engineering left, compared with 0 of 7 whose professional motivations were less related to social impact goals. Three rounds of hour-long interviews with nine students who left engineering explored reasons for leaving, if/how their personal SR impacted their decision, and social impact opportunities they envisioned through their new potential career path. The interviews show professional prosocial desires are motivation to leave combined with unsupportive environments, decontextualized technical courses, and curricular difficulty.

A Study on Causes of Gender Gap in Construction Management: High School Students' Knowledge and Perceptions across Genders,"Coskun, S.; Washington, C.; Erdogmus, E.","This paper addresses three research questions: (1) According to the pertinent literature, what are the main causes of the current gender gap in the construction industry, particularly for management and leadership roles? (2) Is there a significant difference between male and female high-school-age students regarding their level of knowledge of the construction industry? (3) Is there a significant difference between male and female high-school-age students in their perception of the construction industry and factors impacting their career choice? These research questions are addressed by a review of the literature followed by a discussion of precamp survey results from two consecutive years of a two-week high school summer camp, which is focused on construction science and management. The literature review reveals that the issues are deep-routed and complex but can in general be categorized into two groups: the recruitment and retention of women in construction management and related careers. While the literature review summary in this paper addresses both categories, the focus of the paper remains recruitment, particularly through a study of high school students' level of knowledge and perceptions of construction management. The pre-camp surveys assessed the participants' baseline knowledge and perceptions of construction management as a career. The results showed that the knowledge of construction management as a career is very low, with no statistically significant difference between genders. It must be noted here that the participants are biased positively toward the construction management and related careers, as they chose to attend the camp for a variety of reasons, from wanting an experience on the campus of this university to parents' encouragement. Despite this baseline interest, however, the data show that the participants lacked clarity on what this career really entails. It is suggested, therefore that the general knowledge of this career path across larger and more randomized samples across U.S. will be even lower. The perceptions of the construction industry differed slightly between genders, with females perceiving it as more physically challenging and prioritizing family friendliness when considering career options. In conclusion, both the literature review and the survey data analysis show that the lack of knowledge of this career path, exacerbated by the negative perceptions of the construction industry, contribute to the problem of women not choosing to study construction management. The construction industry continues to make significant improvements in their diversity and inclusion efforts, and there are a variety of paths within the industry for graduates of construction science and management degrees. As such, significant work remains for both the industry and academia to overcome the lack of knowledge and negative perceptions of the industry through increased outreach to better inform high school students, parents, and counselors.",2024,/,Buildings,14,7,2164 (28 pp.),,10.3390/buildings14072164,,#244,Coskun 2024,"",""
Gender differences in the Force Concept Inventory for different educational levels in the United Kingdom,"Mears, M.","The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) is widely used to investigate the effect of education level on conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics but has only recently been scrutinized for gender effects and retention.

All participants were either studying or working at the University of Sheffield in the UK and had completed a similar compulsory level of secondary education. As expected the results show that a greater level of education in physics is associated with a larger average FCI score. However, further analysis shows that there exists a gender gap at all levels of education. The size of the effect of gender is quantified using Cohen’s d and ranges from 0.84 to 1.17 which indicates a large effect due to gender for all levels of education. Despite the FCI having been used as a tool to measure learning gains immediately following instruction in Newtonian mechanics there has been little work to investigate whether this increase in FCI score remains after some time has elapsed. Here the increase in FCI scores is found to remain increased after a three month absence of mechanics-related teaching, and that this retention of FCI scores is independent of gender.

Interpretable Multiview Early Warning System Adapted to Underrepresented Student Populations,"Cano, Alberto; Leonard, John D.","Early warning systems have been progressively implemented in higher education institutions to predict student performance. However, they usually fail at effectively integrating the many information sources available at universities to make more accurate and timely predictions, they often lack decision-making reasoning to motivate the reasons behind the predictions, and they are generally biased toward the general student body, ignoring the idiosyncrasies of underrepresented student populations (determined by socio-demographic factors such as race, gender, residency, or status as a freshmen, transfer, adult, or first-generation students) that traditionally have greater difficulties and performance gaps.

Research-Informed policy change: A retrospective on engineering admissions,"Holloway, Beth M.; Reed, Teri; Imbrie, P.K.; Reid, Ken","Background: Few studies have investigated how engineering education admission policies contribute to the underrepresentation of specific groups. Transforming these policies may significantly affect who becomes an engineer. This article reports the outcome of using research results to inform change in admission policy at a Midwestern public university. Purpose: There were three research questions: Is there statistically significant evidence of admission decision gender bias for engineering applicants? Do affective and cognitive factors predictive of engineering student success differ between men and women? Can a difference in the resulting admitted class be confirmed when such factors inform admission policy? Design/Method: Admissions records were examined for differences in cognitive metrics between men and women. Student records were analyzed before and after the policy change. Neural network modeling of student records predicted the cognitive and affective measures most important for success in retention and graduation. Results: Statistical analysis indicated a gender bias in the admission process results, which was traced back to the policy. Success factor modeling suggested a different set of criteria could mitigate this bias.

Development and verification of the programming resilience scale for university students,Qian Fu; Li-Wen Zhang; Jon-Chao Hong; Yan Dong,"Learning programming challenges students who encounter difficulties such as resolving syntax and format errors. These challenges require students to invoke resilience to overcome programming problems and keep trying. In response, this study developed the programming resilience scale for university students (PRSUS). The snowball-sampling method was used to collect the data of science and engineering undergraduates, and the participants were divided into two groups (n1 = 316, n2 = 358) for an exploratory and a confirmatory factor analysis, respectively. For the PRSUS, 3 items were retained for each of 4 dimensions, namely: persistence, perceived value, difficulty cognition, and incremental belief. The reliability and validity indexes indicate the scale is reliable for measuring programming resilience. Moreover, the results showed that most undergraduates had a high level of programming resilience, and they could judge their level correctly in comparison to their peers. The study also found that, although no significant difference was found among the grade or age groups, the programming resilience of the male students was significantly better than that of the female students. The PRSUS is expected to help researchers and teachers to identify students who have difficulties learning programming and to provide early interventions to students. Implications for practice or policy: Students can use the PRSUS to test if they have a high level of programming resilience and improve their programming resilience in a targeted way. Educators can use the PRSUS to identify students who find it difficult to finish programming learning or to judge whether their teaching can make students morewilling to overcome programming difficulties.",2021,/,Australasian Journal of Educational Technology,37,6,141-55,,10.14742/ajet.6833,,#257,QianFu 2021,"",""

The analyses demonstrate that more than a third of the nation’s top scientists maintain this status over the three consecutive periods, with higher shares occurring in the life sciences and lower ones in engineering. Compared to males, females are less likely to maintain top status. There are also regional differences, among which top status is less likely to survive in southern Italy than in the north.

A comparative study on perceptual evaluations of sports shoe exterior,"Shieh, Meng-Dar; Yeh, Yu-En","We investigated consumer psychology, perception, and aesthetics in relation to sports shoe colors in Taiwan. Semantic differential rating (three emotional adjective pairs) and preference rating questionnaires were distributed among 512 university students to investigate whether their responses to various sports shoe colors differed. The results show that black is one of the most popular colors for sports shoes. The participants preferred designs that incorporated white as the secondary color and disliked those that featured green as the main and secondary colors. In addition, designs incorporating black or red as the main color with a bright color as the secondary color were considered modern. Black and white designs were perceived to be more suited to formal occasions. Furthermore, when the area of the main color exceeded that of the secondary color, the participants perceived a strong sense of simplicity, unless the colors were blue and green. The participants preferred two-color over one-color designs, and three-color designs had a higher correlation with participant preferences. Women required more time than men to evaluate a sample. The men typically examined the samples from a frontal angle, whereas the women focused on the sides of the sample. The scoring scale was polarized (e.g., highest score for modern was -10 and 10 for retro), rendering the values of the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis comparatively low, resulting in weak correlations between variables.

Women Engineering Graduate Students Changing Professional Interests in Academia,"Meyers, Kerry L.; Goodrich, Victoria; Wei, Siqing","The disproportionately low number of women in engineering faculty roles is concerning to academic administrators, faculty, and students. Prior studies have focused on engineering identity but not on how the interests of women engineering graduate students may change throughout their program progression. The research reported here focuses on the differences in the professional plans of women engineering graduate students early in their Ph.D. programs as compared to those near completion of their graduate studies. A mixed method study was conducted using survey and focus groups at a medium-sized, Midwestern, private institution during the summer 2021. A survey was sent to about 600 engineering PhD students (both male and female) with analysis primarily utilizing Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Additionally, focus groups of four to six students were conducted based on program progression and gender to better understand the quantitative findings. Survey responses were analyzed by program progression, gender, and international status. Results show that women engineering Ph.D. students' interest in an academic career decreases as they progress through their graduate studies. There are also differences between domestic and international Ph.D. students in terms of their professional interests which is entangled with their legal and immigration status. It is recommended that engineering graduate programs offer formal professional discernment opportunities for 2nd year Ph.D. students, both male and female, to help them to recognize the opportunities available to them upon program completion.

Predictors of University Attrition: Looking for an Equitable and Sustainable Higher Education,"Vidal, J.; Gilar-Corbi, R.; Pozo-Rico, T.; Castejon, J.-L.; Sanchez-Almeida, T.","The failure and dropout of university studies are issues that worry all nations due to the personal, social, and economic costs that this they entail. Because the dropout phenomenon is complex and involves numerous factors, to reverse it would involve a comprehensive approach through interventions aimed at the factors identified as key in the decision to drop out. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to determine the profile of students who enter the EPN (STEM higher-education institution) to analyze the characteristics that differentiate students who drop out early in their career and those who stay in school. A sample of 624 students who accessed the EPN leveling course (a compulsory course at the beginning of their studies) participated in the study. A total of 26.6% of the participants were women. A total of 50.7% of the participants passed the course. Data referring to social, economic, and academic variables were analyzed. Comparison techniques, as well as artificial neural networks, were used to compare characteristic profiles of students who passed the leveling course and those who dropped out. The results showed significant differences between the profiles of the students who passed and those who dropped out with regard to the variables related to previous academic performance and motivational and attributional aspects. The artificial neural networks corroborated the importance of these variables in predicting dropout.

Comparison of Perceptions of Barriers to Advancement for Women in Radiation Oncology between Men and Women Physicians,"Tam, A.; Thomas, R.; Kaul, A.; Barry, P.N.; Li, Y.R.","Purpose/Objective(s)While women now comprise the majority of medical school matriculants, there continues to be a disparity in representation of women in leadership roles and an attrition in the promotion pipeline in medicine. Prior studies have shown that women physicians face unique barriers to advancement in radiation oncology. Thus, understanding how perceptions of these barriers among men and women differ may shed light on why the ""leaky leadership pipeline"" exists.Materials/MethodsAn anonymous survey was disseminated to the American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO) members via email and social media between February and May 2023. In addition to demographics (age, gender, race, practice setting), respondents were asked to respond to statements about their perceptions of the gender barriers in the following domains: (a) equal access, (b) work-life balance, (c) gender bias, and (d) leadership support using a validated 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analyses with chi-square were performed using STATA.ResultsA total of 1107 respondents completed the survey. A majority of (77.1%) identified as female with 22.0% as male (the rest as either non-binary, transgendered, or decline to answer). More than half (53.8%) of participants were aged 30-39, with 76.0% identifying as (non-Hispanic) White. Only a minority (28.1%) of participants are employed at academic medical centers. Overall, we found that men and female radiation oncologists held similar perceptions, with no significant differences in rating between the two groups for 34 of the 45 statements (75.6%; p>0.05). The domains on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" had the most varied ratings, with significant differences in rating for five (41.7%) of 12 statements and five (26.3%) of 19 statements in the respective domain. For example, from the ""leadership support"" domain, 62.1% of women agreed that their chairs tried to ensure that women physicians were not subject to gender-based biases, compared to 52.9% of men (p = 0.01), and 61.1% of women agreed that their chairs were supportive when women physicians talked about work-family issues, compared to 56.1% of men (p = 0.02). Whereas statements from the ""equal access"" domain, 59.7% of women agreed that women physicians had equal access to career development opportunities (compared to 51.6% of men; p = 0.01) and 61.0% of women agreed that women physicians received equitable salaries (compared to 53.3% of men; p = 0.02).ConclusionIn this survey of radiation oncologists, we found that women and men shared similar perceptions of barriers to advancement for women physicians. However, there were some varied perspectives on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" and, unexpectedly, more men expressed concerns about gender equality within these domains than women physicians. Future studies are needed to better understand how differences in gender bias awareness may inform policy changes to overcome the ""leaky pipeline"" for women in radiation oncology.

Latin American Women and Computer Science: A Systematic Literature Mapping,"Holanda, Maristela; Silva, Dilma Da","Contributions: The underrepresentation of women in computer science (CS) majors has long been a focus of attention in many academic documents, the majority of them from the United States and Europe. There is, however, a lack of information about educational interventions (EIs) for women in computing in Latin America. The contribution of this article is to cover this gap and describe what researchers in Latin American countries have been publishing about the recruitment and retention of women in the CS field. Background: Many EIs targeting female students at different educational levels - K-12, undergraduate, and graduate - have been undertaken to increase the participation of women in computing in Latin America. However, descriptions of these activities rarely are included in international academic databases. Research Questions: This literature mapping addresses two main research questions (RQ) about the topic of women in computing in academic publications in Latin American countries: RQ1) what are the characteristics of the publications about women in computing in Latin America? and RQ2) what are the published interventions to recruit and retain women in computing in Latin America? To answer RQ1, six subquestions were created covering year, language, country of origin, document type, and professional track. Furthermore, for RQ2, two subquestions were created involving educational level and the use of software development with a female theme. Methodology: This investigation used the systematic literature mapping process. To achieve a broad coverage of papers, the following sources were included: Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, the proceedings of the Latin American Women in Computing Conference (LAWCC), and those of the Women in Technology (WIT) workshop colocated with the annual conference of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC).

We hypothesized that distancing from gender would be associated with higher well-being for women faculty in STEM. As predicted, the less gender-identified women faculty in STEM were, the better their emotional well-being and the less work-related stress they reported. These relationships were not observed for women in non-STEM disciplines.

"Role of mentorship, career conceptualization, and leadership in developing women's physics identity and belonging","Rosenberg, J.L.; Holincheck, N.; Fernandez, K.; Dreyfus, B.W.; Wardere, F.; Stehle, S.; Butler, T.N.","The percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees in physics (25%) in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging.

With respect to mentorship, consistent with the existing literature, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people.

Inclusion of women to ICT engineering–lessons learned,"Lagesen, Vivian Anette; Pettersen, Ivar; Berg, Line","This paper address how we may understand inclusion strategies designed to reduce the gender gap in higher education in engineering and ICT engineering in particular.

However, such changes seem to be not very sustainable, and need continuous effort. Based on our findings and a review of previous research we argue that inclusion efforts are instrumental in gaining a higher share of women in ICT, but that the win may be short-lived. We suggest that there is a need also to work for a higher share of women faculty to obtain more sustainable recruitment and retainment of women in ICT. Moreover, we found that the probability of dropout among men students was systematically reduced with increased gender balance, which indicates that more gender-balanced programs are more attractive to remain in for both men and women. © 2021 The Author(s).

Damage caused by women’s lower self-efficacy on physics learning,"Kalender, Z.Y.; Marshman, E.; Schunn, C.D.; Nokes-Malach, T.J.; Singh, C.","Self-efficacy is an aspect of students’ motivation that has been shown to play a critical role in students’ engagement, participation, and retention in academic careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Since women are underrepresented in STEM domains such as physics, we studied female and male students’ self-efficacy and its relation to learning outcomes in physics that can be useful for creating equitable and inclusive learning environments. In a longitudinal study, we surveyed approximately 1400 students in calculus-based physics 2 courses to investigate students’ motivational beliefs in physics using a validated survey. We examined female and male students’ self-efficacy scores and the extent to which self-efficacy related to learning outcomes (students’ grades and conceptual post-test scores), especially the significant gender difference in conceptual post-test scores. To reveal the unique contribution of self-efficacy on outcomes, we controlled for several other variables including Physics 1 grades, SAT math scores, and conceptual pretest scores in physics. We found that the gender differences in conceptual post-test performance were mediated by the model variables. In particular, initial self-efficacy differences showed a direct effect on outcomes even when controlling for students’ prior physics knowledge and skill differences, and self-efficacy also had the strongest total gender effect on conceptual learning.

Studying the student's perceptions of engagement and problem-solving skills for academic achievement in chemistry at the higher secondary level,"E., S.; Benjamin, A.E.W.","Student engagement has emerged as a crucial factor in higher education, playing a vital role in shaping the overall quality of learning outcomes. It refers to the active involvement and participation of students in specific activities that research has consistently linked to improved academic achievements. The pervasiveness of the term 'student engagement' has significantly shaped the higher education landscape, reinforcing its importance in fostering effective learning environments. In the realm of higher education, educators are continuously exploring diverse pedagogical approaches to enhance student engagement through active learning. This study focuses on the problem-solving learning model and its implementation to foster a deeper understanding of student engagement, including their positive behaviour, participation in activities, and cognitive capabilities. In this study, a quasi-experimental design was employed, incorporating pre-test, post-test, and non-equivalent control group elements. This specific design was chosen due to the constraints of randomly assigning students to groups. Instead, intact classes were randomly selected and assigned to either the control or experimental groups. The sample study was 476 higher secondary-level chemistry students collected from different higher secondary schools. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select schools from the target population. Initially, schools were selected using a purposive sampling technique, focusing on those with fully equipped chemistry laboratories and qualified chemistry teachers. Additionally, consideration was given to including both female and male students in co-educational chemistry classes, as gender was considered a relevant variable for the study. This study adopts a quasi-experimental design, utilizing an achievement and retention test in chemistry as its primary instrument. The validity of this instrument was ensured through face validation by three expert evaluators. To eliminate the errors of non-equivalence arising from the non-randomization of the research subjects, the analysis of covariance (ANOVA) was used in analysing the data and to remove the error of initial differences in ability levels among the research subjects. The findings of the study demonstrated that students in the experimental group experienced a notable increase in problem-solving success compared to their counterparts in the control group, a difference that became evident right from the first intervention. This study establishes a positive correlation between student engagement and their learning outcomes, indicating that higher engagement leads to better academic performance. Additionally, it observes that the correlation between boys' and girls' problem-solving skills and their learning outcomes is comparatively weaker, suggesting potential variations in how problem-solving abilities impact academic achievement among genders. It also reveals that there is a positive influence on student engagement and problem-solving skills in students' academic achievement. Despite the challenges encountered, the results demonstrated the vital role of the problem-solving learning model, when coupled with student engagement, in fostering students' critical thinking skills concerning reaction rate material.

Using faultline theory (Lau and Murnighan, 1998) as a foundation, we hypothesized that women in STEM have more negative perceptions of their departmental diversity climate, have more negatively discrepant perceptions of their departmental diversity climate, and that this greater perceptual discrepancy relates to higher turnover intentions compared to men in STEM fields and compared to women and men in non-STEM fields. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 737 (62% male, 86% White) faculty who completed an online faculty climate survey. The hypotheses were fully supported. Results point to not only the occurrence of negative diversity climate perceptions but the discrepancy of these perceptions to others in the same work environment. They also suggest the importance of raising dominant group members' awareness of problematic diversity climates so that their perceptions align more closely with those in minoritized positions.",2022,/,Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering,,,49-67,,10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.2021030910,,#279,Miner 2022,"",""
Examining doctoral degree attrition rates: Using expectancy-value theory to compare student values and faculty supports,"Artiles, Mayra S.; Matusovich, Holly M.","US degree completion data show that historically underrepresented students and women are less likely to complete doctorate degrees, particularly in engineering. While there are many studies on persistence, few compare student and faculty perspectives especially in engineering. The purpose of this case study is to compare what experiences motivate doctoral students and what experiences faculty aim to provide based on what faculty believe motivates students, particularly for women and historically underrepresented students in the United States. Drawing on Eccles' Expectancy Value Theory, we answer the questions: What relationships exist between ability beliefs and subjective task values for underrepresented students persisting in earning a doctorate in engineering? How do student and faculty beliefs compare? Our findings show that while both students and faculty agree on ability beliefs to remain motivated, they showed differences in the value they assigned to doctoral experiences; students focus on attainment value and faculty on utility value. Our findings suggest that both advisors and students should prioritize clear communication in their needs and intentions to better support student motivation in the doctoral degree process. While the context of this study is in the US, practitioners can find parallels in our findings to other contexts and their respective underrepresented populations. Our findings have the indirect impact that supporting the motivation of underrepresented students in particular can contribute to increasing diversity in doctorate degree completion rates. © 2020 Tempus Publications.

Closing the gender gap in the Australian astronomy workforce,"Kewley, L.J.","Australian data show that women's participation at the senior levels in astronomy remains at historically low levels, and that women depart astronomy at two to three times the rate of men.

If the status quo is maintained, the fraction of women at all levels will be below 30% for at least 60 years. If gender parity in hiring and retention targets are adopted, the fraction of 33% women at all levels can be achieved in 20 years. If affirmative action is introduced, the fraction of 33% and 50% women at all levels can be achieved in 10 and 25 years, respectively.

Schema and emotion in memory retrieval following video-based learning: An artificial intelligence study,"Vidanaralage, A.J.; Dharmaratne, A.T.; Haque, S.","Adapting innovative educational technologies to bolster students' academic learning is increasing rapidly. This study explored schema congruent and incongruent participants behaviour when experiencing video-based materials as the medium of learning within the frame of a flipped learning environment. The participants watched an educational learning video on a given topic and completed memory retention tests in different time variations: immediate and delayed. Additionally, an artificial intelligence-based emotion analysis examined the emotional valency of participants during two phases: study phase and test phase. The experiment comprised 16 healthy young adult volunteers (8 schema congruent, 8 schema incongruent; 9 males [56.25%], 7 females [43.75%]; age range 20-34 years, mean age 27.31 years, SD = 2.87 years). A combination of statistics-based and AI-based analysis evaluated the effectiveness of video-based learning in terms of retrieval accuracy, response time and emotional valence. The findings indicate that retrieval accuracy for the schema incongruent group was better than schema congruent. Response time for schema congruent group was quicker than schema incongruent. Both groups exhibited more negative emotions during the study phase but more positive emotions during the test phase.Implications for practice or policy: Acceptance testing of video-based learning in tertiary education for different schema groups of students by assessing their emotional state helps educators to enhance pedagogy.

A preliminary investigation into individual differences that predict men’s preferences for cues to fertility in women’s faces,"Welling, Lisa L. M.; Orille, Alex","Purpose: Women have evolved to conceal overt signs of ovulatory status. Evidence shows that men find high fertility women to be more attractive than low fertility women, suggesting that men may be sensitive to subtle cues to fertility. However, studies have yet to explain the variance in men’s sensitivity to such cues. The present study aimed to identify psychological variables that predict men’s preferences for ovulatory cues in women’s faces in an attempt to provide support for or against three hypotheses for concealed ovulation: The Paternal Investment Hypothesis, The Reduced Infanticide Hypothesis, and the Cuckoldry Hypothesis. We also tested whether men with lower sociosexual orientation show a higher preference for cues to ovulation than men with a higher sociosexual orientation. Methods: Heterosexual men (N = 182) completed a survey that assessed levels of various mating market traits, which were used to predict scores on a face preference task comprised of fertile-phase and non-fertile-phase images of the same women. Results: Although men did prefer the faces of women near ovulation more than when they were photographed at other times of the menstrual cycle, the three main hypotheses tested were not supported. However, sociosexuality did negatively predict preference for the high-fertility faces among single participants. Conclusion: The findings suggest that single men who are lower in sociosexuality may benefit from discriminating between fertile and non-fertile women. Future research directions regarding different ovulatory cue stimuli and mechanisms of cue detection are discussed.

Sociocultural factors might play an important role among Hispanic women; however, very few studies have examined this association. Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine the associations between acculturation and maternal diet, physical activity, and PPWR. Design: This is a cross-sectional study of baseline data from 282 Hispanic women participating in the FitMoms/Mamás Activas study, a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of primarily an internet-based weight control program, in reducing PPWR among low-income women. We performed multivariable linear regression to examine the association of acculturation with diet quality, physical activity, and PPWR at study entry. Results: A total of 213 (76%) women had acculturation scores reflecting Mexican orientation or bicultural orientation, whereas 69 (24%) had scores that represented assimilation to Anglo culture. Women who were more acculturated had lower intakes of fruits and vegetables, lower HEI scores, and lower physical activity levels than women who were less acculturated (p < 0.05). We found an association between acculturation and PPWR in that for every 1-unit increase in acculturation score, PPWR increased, on average, by 0.80 kg. Conclusion: Higher acculturation was associated with poorer diet and physical activity behaviors and greater PPWR.

We examined the accumulation of HIV stigma experiences over 1 year in relationship to treatment retention among 251 men and women marginally engaged in HIV care in the southeastern United States. Results showed that cumulative stigma experiences predicted poorer retention in care, with greater stigma experiences related to less consistency in attending scheduled medical appointments.

We analyzed DC surveillance data to examine retention among YMSM living with HIV infection in DC. Methods: We characterized correlates of retention in HIV care (≥2 clinical visits, ≥3 months apart, within 12 months of diagnosis) among YMSM in DC to inform and strengthen local HIV care efforts. We analyzed data from DC HIV surveillance system for YMSM aged 13–29 years diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 and alive in 2013.

Does gender of administrator matter? National study explores US university administrators’ attitudes about retaining women professors in STEM,"Williams, Wendy M.; Mahajan, Agrima; Thoemmes, Felix; Barnett, Susan M.; Vermeylen, Francoise; Cash, Brian M.; Ceci, Stephen J.","Omnipresent calls for more women in university administration presume women will prioritize using resources and power to increase female representation, especially in STEM fields where women are most underrepresented. However, empirical evidence is lacking for systematic differences in female vs. male administrators’ attitudes. Do female administrators agree on which strategies are best, and do men see things differently? We explored United States college and university administrators’ opinions regarding strategies, policies, and structural changes in their organizations designed to increase women professors’ representation and retention in STEM fields. A comprehensive review of past research yielded a database of potentially-effective, recommended policies. A survey based on these policies was sent to provosts, deans, associate deans, and department chairs of STEM fields at 96 public and private research universities across the U.S. These administrators were asked to rate the quality and feasibility of each strategy; 474 provided data, of which 334 contained complete numerical data used in the analyses. Our data revealed that female (vs. male) administrators believed the 44 strategies were higher in quality overall—but not higher in feasibility—with 9 strategies perceived differently by women and men, after imposing conservative statistical controls. There was broad general agreement on the relative-quality rankings of the 44 strategies. Women (vs. men) gave higher quality ratings to increasing the value of teaching, service, and administrative experience in tenure/promotion decisions, increasing flexibility of federal-grant funding to accommodate mothers, conducting gender-equity research, and supporting shared tenure lines enabling work-life balance. Women (vs. men) believed it was more feasible for men to stop the tenure clock for 1 year for childrearing and for universities to support requests for shared tenure lines, but less feasible for women to chair search committees. Our national survey thus supported the belief that placing women into administration creates greater endorsement of strategies to attract and retain women in STEM, although the effectiveness of these strategies was outside the scope of this research. Topics of disagreement between women and men are potentially important focuses of future policy, because female administrators may have insights into how to retain women that male administrators do not share.

One of the hallmark symptoms of PTSD is the repeated retrieval and re-experiencing of the initial fear memory even long after the traumatic event has occurred. Women are nearly twice as likely to develop PTSD following a trauma than men, thus sex differences in the retrieval of fear memories is highly relevant for understanding the development and maintenance of PTSD. In the current study, we aimed to examine sex differences in the retrieval and extinction of either recent or remote fear memories. To do so, we conditioned male and female rats either 1 day (recent) or 28 days (remote) prior to testing retrieval and extinction. While there was no effect of sex or retention interval on initial retrieval, we found that remotely conditioned females exhibited higher rates of freezing than remotely conditioned males in later retrieval/extinction sessions, suggesting a sex difference in the retrieval and/or extinction of remote, but not recent, fear memories. Overall, these results are the first to demonstrate a sex difference in the extinction of remote fear memory, and this may contribute to the differential expression of fear-related disorders like PTSD in men and women.

Additionally, among men higher CD4+ at ART initiation and decreased time between testing and ART initiation was associated with higher rates of retention. Maintaining physical health, a patient-centered treatment environment, supportive partnerships, few negative consequences to disclosure, and the ability to seek care in facilities outside of their community of residence were found to promote retention in care. Conclusions: Features of the ART delivery system in the SEARCH intervention and social and structural advantages emerged as facilitators to retention in HIV care among men. Messaging around the health benefits of early ART start, decreasing logistical barriers to HIV care, support of flexible treatment environments, and accelerated linkage to care, are important to men’s success in ART treatment programs. Men already benefit from increased social support following disclosure of their HIV-status. Future efforts to shift gender norms towards greater equity are a potential strategy to support high levels of engagement in care for both men and women.

Female perception of a partner’s mate value discrepancy and controlling behaviour in romantic relationships,"Danel, Dariusz P.; Siennicka, Agnieszka; Glińska, Kinga; Fedurek, Piotr; Nowak-Szczepańska, Natalia; Jankowska, Ewa A.; Pawłowski, Bogusław; Lewandowski, Zdzisław","Mate value discrepancy (MVD) between heterosexual partners is an important factor influencing relationship satisfaction which, in turn, has an effect on the quality and the stability of the relationship. Therefore, partners’ involvement in mate retention behaviours, such as controlling behaviours, can be related to MVD and our study aims to determine whether such an association exists. In order to do so, we analysed female perception of MVD and their opinion regarding the intensity of controlling behaviours performed by themselves as well as their romantic partners. Female perception of the intensity of controlling behaviours performed by both partners was the highest in couples where a woman assesses her own mate value (MV) as higher than her partner’s MV and significantly different than in relationships where male MV exceeded those of the female. Our study also indicates that MVD should be taken into account when analysing sex differences in intensities of mate retention behaviours. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the significance of the relationship length for controlling behaviour intensity. Findings are discussed within an evolutionary perspective.

Fleeing the ivory tower: Gender differences in the turnover experiences of women faculty,"Martinez, Larry R.; O'Brien, Katharine R.; Hebl, Michelle R.","Purpose: Prior research has established that women and men faculty have different experiences in their professional and personal lives and that academic turnover can be costly and disruptive to home institutions. However, relatively little research has examined gender differences in the antecedent events that contributed to faculty members' voluntary turnover decisions. This study aims to fill this gap. Materials and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained in two ways: by directly contacting faculty members who had voluntarily left their positions through the human resource departments at six institutions and through more wide-scale snowball sampling. The surveys, administered via paper or web based, measured the extent to which participants' experiences with harassment/discrimination, family-related issues, and recruitment/retention offers impacted their decisions to leave. Qualitative data were coded by raters into numerical values, and mean differences based on gender were assessed for these and the quantitative data. Results: Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest that female academicians reported experiencing significantly more gender-based harassment/discrimination, were much more likely to cite family-related reasons for leaving, and reported receiving significantly fewer external job offers and internal retention offers than their male counterparts. Conclusions: Academic science departments should be keenly aware of and strive to reduce instances of harassment/discrimination against female academicians, offer more support for family-related issues and encourage faculty to take advantage of these programs, and conduct search and retention efforts fairly regardless of faculty gender.

It examines how socioecological level and gender influence high-performance sport system (HPSS) stakeholders' perspectives of the relative importance and feasibility to address athlete attrition factors within an Australian high-performance pathway system (HPPS). Design: Mixed methods. Methods: Sub-analysis was conducted of rating data from 30 participants who had contributed to identifying 83 statements in 13 clusters in a previous Concept Mapping study. The 13 clusters were statistically analysed in ‘R’ using cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) to determine differences in perceived importance and feasibility between 1) socioecological levels, and 2) genders. Results: Mean ratings for 11 and three of the 13 clusters were statistically significantly different between at least two of the five socioecological levels, for importance and feasibility, respectively. Athletes had the largest variation in mean ratings from the most (athlete health 4.59), to least (performance potential 2.83) important cluster, when compared to the other four socioecological levels. There were statistically significant differences between the ratings between genders (Men/Women) for two clusters for each rating scale: Importance: ‘athlete health’ (M3.33:W3.84 [p 0.012]); ‘performance potential’ (M3.35:W2.57; [p 0.001]), Feasibility: ‘abuse and mismanagement of health’ (M2.97:W3.68; [p 0.000]) and ‘athlete health’ (M2.54:W3.33; [p 0.000]). Conclusions: This study highlights the need to implement more robust athlete attrition monitoring protocols.

Gender differences in perceptions of resources and turnover intentions of work‐linked couples in masculine occupations,"Huffman, Ann Hergatt; Olson, Kristine J.","Employees in work‐linked marriages have spouses that share the same family and the same workplace and/or occupation. Whereas, in recent years, there has been increasingly more research on dual‐career marriages (i.e. both spouses work, but not necessarily at the same workplace and/or occupation), there has been very little research on work‐linked marriages. The current study focuses on work resources (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviour and job control) as key mediating processes that explain the effect of gender on turnover intentions among work‐linked employees in masculine occupations (i.e. military). Investigating gender differences is important because, compared with men, women are more likely to be in work‐linked marriages and to leave their jobs. Based on role theory and conservation of resource theory, we predicted that gender was related to turnover intentions, and this relationship would be mediated by key explanatory variables (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviours, job control and psychological distress). Mediation analyses, conducted on a sample of men and women in work‐linked marriages (n = 309), provide support for the hypothesized model. These findings offer guidance for understanding gender differences among work‐linked employees in masculine occupations, and how these differences can affect important outcomes such as turnover intentions.

The study collected client- and program-level data in 4 waves in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 from 34 publicly funded methadone treatment programs serving 11,169 clients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The sample included 29.8% female and 70.2% male clients, where 10.6% identified as Black or African American, 41.5% as Latino, 44.2% as non-Latino white, and 3.8% as Other. We conducted two multilevel negative binomial regression models to examine direct and moderated relationships related to both access (days on the waitlist) and retention (days in treatment) while accounting for clients clustered within programs. Gender disparities existed in both access and retention where women spent more time than men waiting to enter treatment but then remained in treatment longer. Further, female clients identifying as African American, Latino, and Other were at greater risk for shorter treatment duration than those who identified as non-Latino white and men. Overall, OUD clients receiving methadone treatment in low-income neighborhoods experienced barriers to access and retention in treatment associated with mental illness, family responsibilities, and use severity. OUD clients with MediCal insurance eligibility were consistently more likely to gain access to and remain in methadone treatment. Overall, findings call for improving treatment access and retention for women with OUD who receive methadone in outpatient methadone treatment programs through comprehensive, gender-specific, and evidence-based programming.

"Gender inequalities in unpaid public work: Retention, stratification and segmentation in the volunteer leadership of charities in England and Wales","Clifford, David","While gender inequalities in employment (paid public work) and domestic and reproductive labour (unpaid private work) are a prominent focus within the sociological literature, gender inequalities in volunteering (unpaid public work) have received much less scholarly attention. We analyse a unique longitudinal dataset of volunteer leaders, that follows through time every individual to have served as a board member (trustee) for a charity in England and Wales between 2010 and 2023, to make three foundational contributions to our understanding of gender inequalities in unpaid public work. First, the salience of vertical gender stratification and horizontal gender segmentation in trusteeship shows that gendered inequalities in work extend to public work in general—encompassing unpaid public work, and not only paid public work. In terms of gender segmentation, we find that women are over‐represented as trustees in a small number of fields of charitable activity but under‐represented across the majority of fields. In terms of gender stratification, we find that women are under‐represented on the boards of the largest charities; under‐represented as chairs of trustee boards; and particularly under‐represented as chairs of the largest charities. Second, the dynamics underlying gendered differences in unpaid public work, which show higher rates of resignation for women trustees, resonate with research on paid employment which emphasises the importance of attrition to an understanding of how gendered inequalities in work are reproduced. This means that increasing the retention of women, not only the recruitment of women, becomes central to the policy agenda. Third, we show that there has been a decline in gender stratification and gender segmentation in trusteeship since 2010. This decline over time in gendered inequalities in unpaid public work provides an interesting counterpoint to influential research documenting a ‘stall’ in the reduction of gendered inequalities in paid employment.

However, it is unknown whether intersections between social categories—race, socioeconomic status (SES), sex, and age—influence the association of varying forms of discrimination with telomere length. We examined these associations in a socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse urban sample. Methods: Cross-sectional data were from 341 middle-aged (30–64 years) African American and White, community participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study (HANDLS). Multiple regression models examined up to 3-way interactions between a discrimination measure (i.e., everyday, racial, gender, lifetime burden, and frequency of discrimination across sources) and two social categories. Results: After adjusting for depressive symptoms, waist circumference, and lifetime substance use, two themes emerged: 1) among women with higher SES, a) greater lifetime discrimination burden (b = -0.23, p = .011), gender discrimination (b = -0.29, p = .040), and racial discrimination (b = -0.24, p = 0.023) and 2) among younger adults, irrespective of race and sex, greater frequency of discrimination across sources (b = 0.002, p = .008) was associated with shorter telomeres. Conclusions: Irrespective of race, women with higher SES and younger adults reporting greater discrimination may be at particular risk for accelerated aging. Telomere attrition promotes and accelerates chronic health conditions for which there are health disparities.

Linking undergraduate professional identity development in engineering to major embeddedness and persistence,"Burleson, Seterra D.; Major, Debra A.; Hu, Xiaoxiao; Shryock, Kristi J.","Although the development of professional identity is thought to play a central role in the career development process, little empirical research has examined change in professional identity over time and its connection to adjustment and persistence in a professional field of study. In this research, latent growth modeling was used to examine the effects of pre-college professional identity and change in professional identity through the first year of college in a sample of engineering students (N = 295). Results indicated that professional identity prior to entering college and rate of change in professional identity over the first year of study were related to major embeddedness dimensions of fit (i.e., match between oneself and the major), links (i.e., professional connections), and sacrifice (i.e., costs and benefits associated with leaving the major). Rate of change in professional identity was also positively related to persistence in the engineering major the following year. Despite the general utility of professional identity in predicting embeddedness, men and women differed in several important parameter estimates. This research suggests professional identity development is best conceptualized and empirically examined as a dynamic process that occurs over time, contributes to understanding of the factors underlying adjustment and persistence of women and men in STEM career pathways, and emphasizes the importance of fostering pre-college professional identity and professional identity development early in professional programs of study.

We use a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a time-matched psychoeducation control to test MMWR effects on residential treatment retention. We used clinical staff-determined residential site discharge status and discharge date from the SUD treatment site record to determine retention. We tested for study group differences in retention defined as time to treatment non-completion without improvement (i.e., patient left treatment before completion of the treatment plan and made little or no progress toward achieving treatment goals based on clinical team determination), as well as differences in self-report of study intervention mechanisms of action (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, distress, affect, and drug and alcohol craving). The analytic timeframe for the survival analysis was from study intervention start date to 150 days later. The sample (N = 200) was female, majority amphetamine/methamphetamine users (76%), Hispanic (58%), with a history of incarceration (62%).

Survival analysis of the intent-to-treat sample showed the risk of non-completion without improvement was lower in MMWR as compared to the control group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.16–1.08, p = .07). Both groups improved on select self-reported mechanism measure scores at immediate post-intervention, but only in the MMWR group did class attendance (dosage) have a large-size correlation with improved mindfulness (r = .61, p < .01), distress tolerance (r = 0.55, p < .01) and positive affect (r = 0.52, p < .01) scores.

New routes to recruiting and retaining women in STEM: Policy implications of a communal goal congruity perspective,"Diekman, Amanda B.; Weisgram, Erica S.; Belanger, Aimee L.","Despite advances within a wide range of professional roles, women remain a minority in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and occupations. The gender gap in mathematics and science performance has converged, and so it is important to consider the motivational reasons that might underlie the differential STEM pursuits of women and men. The goal congruity perspective contends that a fundamental cause of gender gaps in STEM pursuits is the gender difference in communal motivation (i.e., an orientation toward others). STEM fields may be particularly likely to deter communally oriented individuals because these fields are thought to impede goals of directly benefitting others, altruism, or collaboration. In this review, we examine how the communal goal perspective might address the challenges of gender gaps in STEM pursuits from childhood through adulthood. We review the logic and evidence for the goal congruity perspective, and we examine two other deterrents to women in STEM—work‐family challenges and stereotyping—from the perspective of this framework. We then examine particular recommendations for policy actions that might broaden participation of women and girls, and communally oriented people generally, in STEM.

Parting ways: Sex-based differences in premedical attrition,"Grace, Matthew K.","Despite women's greater propensity to enter college aspiring to careers in medicine, they are less likely than men to persist in these ambitions. Past research suggests that students' experiences in coursework strongly influence their decision to continue along or depart from the premedical track, yet it remains unclear whether women and men have differential experiences in coursework that contribute to sex-based disparities in premedical attrition. To gain insight into whether and how premeds' experiences in coursework contribute to gendered patterns of attrition, this study employs a mixed methods design that combines longitudinal survey data collected from premedical students at a large state university with in-depth interview data collected from a subset of respondents. Survey results (n = 268) demonstrate that while women report more stress from premedical coursework than men, these differences do not help to explain the female-male gap in attrition. Rather, it is women's lower levels of affinity for premedical coursework—specifically, their less positive evaluations of premed coursework, and greater enjoyment of non-premed courses—that contribute most notably to the gender gap in attrition. Qualitative results (n = 39) suggest that women's affinity for premed coursework is diminished by more frequent, negative interactions with faculty, and a tendency to interpret low grades in premedical coursework as a sign that this career track is a ‘poor fit’ for their strengths and aptitudes. These findings broadly align with scholarship on the role of self-expressive decision-making in curricular sex segregation. Interview data also point to a critical factor for sustaining women's medical career aspirations: clinical experiences. Ranging from shadowing, to volunteer experiences, to jobs in local hospitals, these experiences allow women to ‘try on’ the role of doctor and inspire resilience in the face of academic adversity. The implications of findings for future research on premedical education are discussed.

In the present study, we explore behavioral methods adopted to cyberstalk intimate partners. Participants (N = 449, 50.1% men) recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk completed an online questionnaire and we assessed a range of intimate partner cyberstalking behaviors across mating contexts (i.e., short-term v long-term relationships) and goals (i.e., mate retention v mate attainment). These cyberstalking behaviors were factor analyzed (i.e., Exploratory Factor Analysis) and reduced to reveal three dimensions: Passive, invasive, and duplicitous. Both men and women largely engage in passive cyberstalking, though women perpetrated more overall, passive, and invasive intimate partner cyberstalking. Women were also likely to adopt invasive behaviors to retain a long-term mate and attain a short-term mate. We also examined associations between the Dark Tetrad traits, social motives, and cyberstalking. All Dark Tetrad traits were associated with more overall cyberstalking but demonstrated differential patterns across the three forms, substantiating a dimensional conceptualization of this online behavior. Results of the current study contribute to establishing a theoretical framework to understand perpetration of intimate partner cyberstalking, ultimately contributing to managing the potentially harmful online behavior.

"Recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine: How institutions are addressing gender disparities","Carr, Phyllis L.; Gunn, Christine; Raj, Anita; Kaplan, Samantha; Freund, Karen M.","Objective: Greater numbers of women in medicine have not resulted in more women achieving senior positions. Programs supporting the recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine could help to achieve greater advancement of more women to leadership positions. Qualitative research was conducted to understand such programs at 23 institutions and, using the social ecological model, examine how they operate at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels. Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted with faculty representatives (n = 44) of the Group on Women in Medicine and Science, Diversity and Inclusion, or senior leaders with knowledge on gender climate in 24 medical schools. Four trained interviewers conducted semistructured interviews that addressed faculty perceptions of gender equity and advancement, which were audiotaped and transcribed. The data were categorized into three content areas—recruitment, promotion, and retention—and coded a priori for each area based on their social ecological level of operation. Findings: Participants from nearly 40% of the institutions reported no special programs for recruiting, promoting, or retaining women, largely describing such programming as unnecessary. Existing programs primarily targeted the individual and interpersonal levels simultaneously, via training, mentoring, and networking, or the institutional level, via search committee trainings, child and elder care, and spousal hiring programs. Lesser effort at the academic community and policy levels were described. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that many U.S. medical schools have no programs supporting gender equity among medical faculty. Existing programs primarily target the individual or interpersonal level of the social ecological interaction. The academic community and broader policy environment require greater focus as levels with little attention to advancing women’s careers. Universal multilevel efforts are needed to more effectively advance the careers of medical women faculty and support gender equity.

Retaining female postgraduates in academia: The role of gender and prospective parenthood,"Crabb, Shona; Ekberg, Stuart","Women remain under-represented in almost all academic levels at universities internationally, and previous evidence has suggested that women move out of the university system in increasing numbers as they progress from postgraduate study to an academic career. The current study aimed to explore the role of gender in the reports of study experiences and future career plans of Australian postgraduate research students (n = 249). Questionnaire data indicated women were significantly less likely than men to rate an academic career as appealing. In particular, female postgraduate students without dependent children were least likely to want to pursue an academic career.

Serial pattern retention in male and female rats,"Sharp, Jessica L.; Miller-Cahill, Megan E.; Riccio, David C.; Fountain, Stephen B.","Serial pattern learning is a model paradigm for studying parallel-processing in complex learning in rats. The current experiment extends the paradigm to the study of sequential memory by examining forgetting curves for the component element types that make up a serial pattern. Adult male and female rats were trained in a serial multiple choice (SMC) task in which rats learned a serial pattern of nose-poke responses in a circular array of 8 receptacles mounted on the walls of an octagonal operant chamber. The pattern was 123–234–345–456–567–678–781–818, where digits represent the clockwise positions of successive correct receptacles. Previous work has shown that chunk-boundary elements (the first element of each 3-element chunk), within-chunk elements (the second and third elements in all but the last chunk), and the violation element (the last element of the pattern) are learned via different cognitive mechanisms. After each rat was trained to an 85% correct performance criterion on the violation element, we then assessed serial pattern retention at 24-h, 2-week, and 4-week retention intervals. For chunk-boundary and within-chunk elements, forgetting was observed only at the 4-week retention interval. Sex differences were observed; females performed better than males on within-chunk elements at 24-h and 4-week retention intervals. For the violation element, significant forgetting was observed earlier at the 2-week retention interval as well as at the 4-week retention interval. Thus, pattern elements that were learned slower were forgotten faster. The experiment provides a proof of concept for evaluating forgetting curves separately for the multiple memory systems rats appear to employ concurrently in this paradigm, a method that may prove useful in characterizing the impact of relevant neurobiological manipulations on forgetting in multiple sequential memory systems.

"Sex differences in hippocampal β-adrenergic receptor subtypes drive retrieval, retention, and learning of cocaine-associated memories","Berry, Melanie M.; Miller, Beau; Kelsen, Silvia; Cockrell, Carlee; Kohtz, Amy Stave","Background: Drug seeking behavior occurs in response to environmental contexts and drug-associated cues. The presence of these pervasive stimuli impedes abstinence success. β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) have a longstanding historical implication in driving processes associated with contextual memories, including drug-associated memories in substance use disorders. However, sex differences in the role of β-adrenergic receptors in drug memories remain unknown. Hypothesis: Prior reports indicate a selective role for β2-ARs in retrieval and retention of contextual drug memories in males, and substantial sex differences exist in the expression of β-ARs of male and female rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that there are sex differences in selective recruitment of β-ARs during different stages of memory encoding and retrieval. Methods: The role of β-ARs in driving retrieval and learning of contextual cocaine memories was investigated using cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) in adult male and female Sprague–Dawley rats. Rats were infused directly to the dorsal hippocampus with Propranolol (β1 and β2) or ICI-118,551 (β1) and/or Betaxolol (β2), immediately prior to testing (retrieval), or paired to each cocaine (10 mg/kp, IP) conditioning session (learning). Results: In males, administration of either β1, β2, or combined β1 and β2-ARs before the initial CPP testing reduced the expression of a CPP compared to vehicle administration. In females, β2-ARs transiently decreased CPP memories, whereas β1 had long lasting but not immediate effects to decrease CPP memories. Additionally, β1 and combined β1 and β2-ARs had immediate and persistent effects to decrease CPP memory expression. DG Fos + neurons predicted cocaine CPP expression in males, whereas CA1 and CA3 Fos + neurons predicted cocaine CPP expression in females. Conclusion: There are significant sex differences in the role of dorsal hippocampus β-ARs in the encoding and expression of cocaine conditioned place preference. Furthermore, sub regions of the dorsal hippocampus appear to activate differently between male and female rats during CPP. Therefore DG, CA3, and CA1 may have separate region- and sex-specific impacts on driving drug- associated, or context-associated cues.

Sex differences in proliferation and attrition of pubertally born cells in the rat posterior dorsal medial amygdala,"Mohr, Margaret A.; Michael, Nancy Staffend; DonCarlos, Lydia L.; Sisk, Cheryl L.","The rodent posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) evaluates and assigns valence to social sensory stimuli. The perception of social stimuli evolves during puberty, when the focus of social interactions shifts from kin to peers. Using the cell birthdate marker bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), we previously discovered that more pubertally born cells are added to the rat MePD in males than females. Here we addressed several questions that remained unanswered by our previous work. First, to determine whether there are sex differences in cell proliferation within the MePD, we examined BrdU-immunoreactive (-ir) cells at 2 and 4 h following BrdU administration on postnatal day 30 (P30). The density of BrdU-ir cells was greater in males than in females, indicating greater proliferation in males. Proliferation was substantiated by double-label immunohistochemistry showing that MePD BrdU-ir cells colocalize proliferating cell nuclear antigen, but not the cell death marker Caspase3. We next studied longer time points (2–21 days) following BrdU administration on P30 and found that the rate of cell attrition is higher in males. Finally, triple-label immunohistochemistry of P30-born MePD cells revealed that some of these cells differentiate into neurons or astrocytes within three weeks of cell birth, with no discernable sex differences. The demonstration of pubertal neuro- and glio-genesis in the MePD of male and female rats adds a new dimension to developmental plasticity of the MePD that may contribute to pubertal changes in the perception of social stimuli in both sexes.

"Sex, diurnal variation and retention interval differently affect performance of marmoset monkeys in a recognition memory task for object location","Vannuchi, Clarissa R. S.; Costa, Clara S.; de Jesus, Fernando M.; Maior, Rafael S.; Barros, Marilia","In the spontaneous object-location (SOL) task, the ability to recognize where stimuli were located in a past encounter is assessed. Even if widely used in rodents, several aspects can affect task performance. It is thus important to assess potentially intervening variables in the new monkey SOL task. Here we assessed whether sex (male vs. females), circadian time (morning vs. afternoon) and retention interval (24 vs. 48 h) affect the performance of adult marmosets in this task. Two identical stimuli were initially explored on a 10-min sample trial. Thereafter, preferential exploration of the displaced vs. the stationary object was analyzed on a 10-min test trial. Both sexes similarly explored the displaced object quicker and longer than the stationary item after a 24 h inter-trial interval. This response pattern was also seen when males were similarly assessed in the morning or afternoon. However, males tested after 48 h explored both objects equally and after a similar latency, yet spent more time where the displaced item had been previously located. Task performance was not related to object exploration during encoding and general activity remained constant. Therefore, sex and diurnal variation in circadian time had no effect on this version of the task, whereas place memory naturally decayed after 24 h. Our results underscore the importance of alternative task parameters to evaluate memory decay. Given the widespread use of spontaneous recognition tasks, a more ecologically-inclined task in monkeys will help translate animal data to clinical research.

Sexual selection drives evolution and rapid turnover of male gene expression,"Harrison, Peter W.; Wright, Alison E.; Zimmer, Fabian; Dean, Rebecca; Montgomery, Stephen H.; Pointer, Marie A.; Mank, Judith E.","The profound and pervasive differences in gene expression observed between males and females, and the unique evolutionary properties of these genes in many species, have led to the widespread assumption that they are the product of sexual selection and sexual conflict. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the connection between sexual selection and transcriptional dimorphism, often termed sex-biased gene expression. Moreover, the relative contribution of sexual selection vs. drift in shaping broad patterns of expression, divergence, and polymorphism remains unknown. To assess the role of sexual selection in shaping these patterns, we assembled transcriptomes from an avian clade representing the full range of sexual dimorphism and sexual selection. We use these species to test the links between sexual selection and sex-biased gene expression evolution in a comparative framework. Through ancestral reconstruction of sex bias, we demonstrate a rapid turnover of sex bias across this clade driven by sexual selection and show it to be primarily the result of expression changes in males. We use phylogenetically controlled comparative methods to demonstrate that phenotypic measures of sexual selection predict the proportion of male-biased but not female-biased gene expression. Although male-biased genes show elevated rates of coding sequence evolution, consistent with previous reports in a range of taxa, there is no association between sexual selection and rates of coding sequence evolution, suggesting that expression changes may be more important than coding sequence in sexual selection. Taken together, our results highlight the power of sexual selection to act on gene expression differences and shape genome evolution.

Then, considering the literature on job crafting, we problematize the notion of employees proactively optimizing their work environment to show how some female GPs work within gender constraints to craft a sustainable medical career, with others failing.

The gender equity gap: A multistudy investigation of within-job inequality in equity-based awards,"Klein, Felice B.; Hill, Aaron D.; Hammond, Ryan; Stice-Lusvardi, Ryan","Laws in many countries mandate paying men and women equally when in similar jobs. Such laws, coupled with considerable organizational efforts, lead some scholars to contend that within-job pay inequality is no longer a source of the gender pay gap. We argue important differences in a widely used form of pay heretofore overlooked in existing studies—equity-based awards (i.e., pay where the value is tied to the employing organization’s stock, such as stock and stock options)—may cause underestimation of gender-based within-job pay inequality. Specifically, we theorize that because of differences in both why and how equity-based awards are distributed to employees compared to other forms of pay, a gender gap will exist in equity-based awards, with biased perceptions of retention driving the gap. Using a multimethod study with novel data from two technology organizations, archival data from publicly traded firms, and experimental data, we find consistent support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that using equity-based awards as a means to retain employees, and the rationale and processes associated with distributing such pay, can result in gender-based within-job inequality. Thus, our study sheds light on a previously overlooked form of inequality in the workplace while offering implications for both theory and practice.

Turnover or turnaway? Competing risks analysis of male and female IT professionals’ job mobility and relative pay gap,"Joseph, Damien; Ang, Soon; Slaughter, Sandra A.","This study draws on distributive justice, human capital, and stigmatization theories to hypothesize relationships between relative pay gap and patterns of job mobility. Our study also expands the criterion space of job mobility by contrasting different job destinations when information technology (IT) professionals make job moves. We examine three job moves: (a) turnover to another IT job in a different firm, (b) turnaway-within to a non-IT job, and (c) turnaway-between to a different firm and a non-IT job. We analyze work histories spanning 28 years for 359 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We report three major findings. First, as hypothesized, larger relative pay gaps significantly increase the likelihood of job mobility. Second, IT males and IT females have different job mobility patterns. IT males are more likely to turn over than turn away-between when faced with a relative pay gap. Further, and contrary to predictions from human capital theory, IT males are more likely to turn away-within than turn over. This surprising finding suggests that the ubiquitous use of IT in other business functions may have increased the value of IT skills for non-IT jobs and reduced the friction of moving from IT to other non-IT positions. Third, and consistent with stigmatization arguments, IT females are more likely to turn away from IT than to turn over when faced with a relative pay gap. In fact, to reduce relative pay gaps, IT females tend to take on lower-status jobs that pay less than their IT jobs. We conclude this study with important theoretical, practical, and policy implications.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This quantitative study examined responses from respondents (n = 2,988) of the 2008 National Study of the Changing Workforce using descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVAs, and structural equation models (SEM). The paper focusses primarily on Hispanics and also examined gender differences for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. Findings: Hispanic women reported the highest work-family conflict (work interfering with family (WIF) and family interfering with work (FIW)) and synergy (work-family synergy (WFS)) levels. Job resources are related to WIF for Hispanic women but not Hispanic men. Autonomy was the best predictor of WFS for all groups. Coping mediated the depression-life satisfaction relationship. WIF and WFS were each significantly related to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and life satisfaction were significantly related for all groups except Hispanic women. Job satisfaction-turnover paths were significant.

The review revealed that technology-integrated teaching positively affected students' academic achievement, attitude toward chemistry, and retention capacity. The review result also confirmed that similar benefits were observed from both male and female students in technology-based instruction. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps observed in the field of the impacts of technology-integrated teaching on students' achievement, attitude, and retaining chemistry content. Thus, it is likely to conclude that technology-integrated chemistry instruction improves students' academic achievement, attitude, and retention capacity. It is also possible to conclude that technology-based instruction is gender-friendly. Most of the research has been done in high school using a quasi-experimental design, the researchers recommended that further research in middle schools on different chemistry topics using different research designs (e.g., Design-Based Research) in doing research in this area.",2024,,Education and Information Technologies,29,11,13763-13785,3112178444; EJ1437291,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-12411-2,,#332,Woldemariam 2024,"",""
Role Models in Action through YouTube Videos for Engineering Community College Students,"Lee, Hye Rin; Rutherford, Teomara; Hanselman, Paul; Rodriguez, Fernando; Ramirez, Kevin F; Eccles, Jacquelynne S","Community colleges provide broad access to a college degree due to their less expensive tuition, greater course time offerings, and more open admission policies compared to four-year universities as reported (Juszkiewicz, 2015). These institutions have great potential to diversify who chooses STEM, such as engineering. Such diverse representation is important, because students from different backgrounds can contribute new perspectives that foster creative and innovative approaches to solving problems. However, approximately 40% of the students who enter community college in the U.S. leave before graduation (Xu & Jaggars, 2011). Harnessing the power of social media to reduce attrition, we tested a pilot intervention in which community college students in engineering courses completed a reflection exercise after watching YouTube videos of former engineering students from similar backgrounds who successfully transferred to a four-year college. Quasi-experimental analyses (N = 537) show that students in the intervention received higher engineering course grades and had greater odds of enrolling in an engineering course in the subsequent term compared to those who were not in the intervention. Additionally, we find support for the hypothesis that the intervention has larger benefits for women.

"Gender, Self-Efficacy and Attrition from STEM Programmes: Evidence from Danish Survey and Registry Data","Pedersen, Jens Vognstoft; Nielsen, Mathias Wullum","The persistent gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is often attributed to differences in students' confidence in their own academic abilities (i.e. self-efficacy). Yet, the role of self-efficacy in mediating gender differences in STEM attrition is unclear. To address this issue, we analyse administrative register data and representative survey responses from two cohorts of students (N = 14,427) who entered higher education programmes in 2017 and 2019. In linear models that adjust for high-school performance, parents' education level and other relevant background variables, we find that women have lower average self-efficacy levels than men before entering higher education. This gender gap is not specific to STEM fields but also exists in the humanities and social sciences. Although women have higher dropout rates than men in some, but not all STEM areas (most notably in mathematics and physics), self-efficacy differences do not explain this gap, suggesting that factors beyond prior achievements, sociodemographic background and confidence in one's own abilities perpetuate gender disparities in STEM attrition.",2024,,Studies in Higher Education,49,1,47-61,3040232267; EJ1404171,https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2023.2220702,,#334,Pedersen 2024,"",""
Effects of Technology-Integrated Chemistry Instruction on Students' Academic Achievement and Retention Capacity,"Yesgat, Derejaw; Melesse, Solomon; Andargie, Dereje; Beyene, Belete Bedemo","This study determined how chemistry instruction using technology affected student achievement and retention.

The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent sample t-test were used to statistically examine the data. A one-way ANOVA analysis revealed that, for achievement and retention, respectively, the mean scores of both trial groups showed statistically significant differences from the mean scores of comparison groups F (3.161)=88.568, p<0.05 and F (3.161)=14.75, p<0.05).

Independent sample t-test shows that male and female students' post-test scores for achievement or retention in the experimental group results was (t (42)=1.53; p>0.05 and t (38)=-0.465; p>0.05, respectively. This intervention has no statistically significant gender related impact on students' achievement and retention.

Social Interactions and Practices That Positively Influenced Women's Retention in Their Computer Science Major,"Pantic, Katarina; Clarke-Midura, Jody","Background and Context: Despite over 30 years of research on broadening participation, women are still underrepresented in Computer Science (CS) education. While enrolment in CS majors has increased, women earn only 18% of the CS baccalaureate degrees in the US. Objective: Most research focuses on why women leave CS. This study explores factors (i.e. social interactions and practices) that support retention from the perspective of women who persisted in their CS major. Methods: We interviewed ten participants first by separating them in two focus groups and then by using individual in-depth interviews. Findings: We identified four types of social interactions that support retention of women. In terms of practices, we present four of the most frequent practices, and four practices that characterised retention of women at the periphery. These findings add nuanced understanding of factors that support retention of women through the theoretical lens of legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice.

Predicting Student Retention in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs),"Addison, Letetia; Williams, Densil","Purpose: This paper aims to provide a parsimonious but rigorous model to assist decision-makers to determine critical factors which can lead to higher graduation rates amongst higher education institution (HEI) participants. It predicts the odds of dropout amongst university students, using HEI data from a developing country. This is used as a basis for a Student Retention Predictive (SRP) Model to inform HEI administrators about predicted risks of attrition amongst cohorts. Design/methodology/approach: A classification tool, the Logistic Regression Model, is fitted to the data set for a particular HEI in a developing country. The model is used to predict significant factors for student dropout and to create a base model for predicted risks by various student demographic variables. Findings: To reduce dropout and to ensure higher graduation rates, the model suggests that variables such as age group, faculty, academic standing and cumulative GPA are significant. These indicative results can drive intervention strategies to improve student retention in HEIs and lessen the gap between graduates and non-graduates, with the goal of reducing socio-economic inequalities in society. Originality/value: This research employs risk bands (low, medium and high) to classify students at risk of attrition or drop out. This provides invaluable insights to HEI administrators in the development of intervention strategies to reduce dropout and increase graduation rates to impact the wider public policy issue of socio-economic inequities.",2023,,"Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning",13,5,865-885,2890000993; EJ1397049,https://doi.org/10.1108/HESWBL-12-2022-0257,,#337,Addison 2023,"",""

Engineering Ableism: The Exclusion and Devaluation of Engineering Students and Professionals with Physical Disabilities and Chronic and Mental Illness,"Cech, Erin A.","Background: The experiences of students and professionals with disabilities are routinely excluded from scholarly and policy debates about equity in engineering. Emergent research suggests that engineering is particularly ableist, yet systematic accounts of the possible exclusion and devaluation faced by engineers with disabilities are largely missing. Purpose/Hypothesis: This paper asks, do engineers with disabilities have more negative interpersonal experiences in engineering classrooms and workplaces than those without disabilities? Utilizing a social relational model of disability, I hypothesize that engineers with physical disabilities and chronic and mental illness are more likely to experience exclusion and professional devaluation than their peers and, partly as a result, have lower persistence intentions. Data/Methods: The paper uses survey data from 1729 students enrolled in eight US engineering programs (American Society for Engineering Education Diversity and Inclusion Survey) and 8321 US-employed engineers (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Inclusion Study Survey). Analyses use regression, mediation, and intersectional approaches. Results: Consistent with expectations, engineering students and professionals with disabilities are less likely than their peers to experience ""social inclusion"" and ""professional respect"" at school and work. Students with disabilities are more likely to ""intend to leave their engineering programs"" and professionals with disabilities are more likely to have ""thought about leaving their engineering jobs"" compared to peers, and their greater risks of encountering interpersonal bias help account for these differences. Analyses also reveal intersectional variation by gender and race/ethnicity. Conclusion: These results suggest that engineering harbors widespread ableism across education and work.

Belonging in General Chemistry Predicts First-Year Undergraduates' Performance and Attrition,"Fink, Angela; Frey, Regina F.; Solomon, Erin D.","Feeling a sense of belonging in a learning environment can have positive effects on student success. The impact of this psychosocial variable on undergraduates' achievement and retention has been demonstrated in STEM disciplines, especially for women within physical sciences where large disparities in gender representation persist. The current study explores the relationship between belonging and student success in undergraduate chemistry, where greater gender parity has recently emerged. In particular, this research investigates the belonging of first-year students enrolled in a two-semester General Chemistry course sequence. The study begins by examining whether students' early sense of belonging in the course, indexed by two survey measures (perceived belonging, belonging uncertainty) varies depending on their demographics and academic preparation. The belonging measures are then used as predictors of performance in General Chemistry 1 and 2 and attrition from one semester to the next. Paralleling research in other STEM disciplines, the results show that female students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, reported lower belonging and higher uncertainty than male students within the first weeks of the course. After accounting for demographics, preparation, and participation in a course supplemental program, the belonging measures predicted performance and attrition for all students.

"Nexus between Gender and Language Shift among the Youth in Nairobi County, Kenya","Kimani, Rosemary Wamaitha; Nyarigoti, Naom Moraa; Gathigia, Moses Gatambuki","The phenomenon of language shift is brought about by language contact. Language shift from mother tongue to another language among the youth is an issue that cannot be wished away due to, ""inter alia"", factors like urbanization, migration, multilingualism or bilingualism and the country's language policy. Studies have also shown that there is notable difference in the use of language along gender lines. The objective of this study, therefore, is to assess the nexus between the gender variable and language shift among the youth in Nairobi County, Kenya. The study is anchored on a sociolinguistic theory known as the Domain Theory. The study adopted the ""ex-post facto"" research design. The study targeted students in public day secondary schools in Nairobi County, Kenya. The sample size of the study comprised 98 students drawn from public day secondary schools in three sub-counties in Nairobi County. Questionnaires were used as the tools of data collection. The reliability of the tool was computed using the Cronbach's coefficient method with a reliability coefficient of 0.83. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the findings of the data. Chi-square tests were conducted to establish the relationship between gender and language shift. There was a significant relationship (?2=18.143, p<0.05) between gender and the language used in communication with students of the same sex. There was also a significant relationship (?2 =13.144, p<0.005) between gender and the language used at school. The findings also show that majority of those who use Kiswahili (62%), Sheng (100%), English and Sheng (100%) or Kiswahili and Sheng (100%) are males. The findings, therefore, show that female and male students use languages differently and therefore, language shift occurred differently between the two genders. The findings, therefore, imply that in schools, female students are more likely to use English while male students are more likely to use Sheng. Kiswahili is used equally among males and females while mother tongue is not used at all. The study concludes that gender plays a significant role in language shift among the youth in Nairobi County.

Why Agriculture Teachers Leave: A National Examination of Turnover Intentions and Work-Family Conflict,"Sorensen, Tyson J.; McKim, Aaron J.; Velez, Jonathan J.","Using data from a random sample of secondary school agriculture teachers in the United States, this study explored the work-family conflict and turnover intentions of agriculture teachers. Additionally, this study sought to determine the relationship between work-family conflict and turnover intentions among agriculture teachers. Work-family conflict was split into two domains, work interference with family and family interference with work. Teachers reported the higher level of work-family conflict within the work interference with family domain. However, agriculture teachers in this study identified moderately low turnover intentions. The three variables of interest (i.e., work interference with family, family interference with work, and turnover intentions) were compared by gender with no statistically significant differences identified. The final objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the two work-family conflict variables and turnover intentions. The model predicted 18% of the turnover intentions among agriculture teachers.

Assessing the Link between Stress and Retention and the Existence of Barriers to Support Service Use within HE,"Harris, P. J.; Campbell Casey, S.

This mixed methods study aimed to investigate stress levels of undergraduate students in a post-1992, Scottish university and the potential for measures of stress to act as an indicator of a student's intention to continue. The study sampled primarily engaged students as tests were administered during timetabled classes and required the students' voluntary participation. The level of perceived stress reported by these students appeared to be high (mean PSS-14 scores of 18.42 (SD 8.452) and 24.57 (SD 8.969) for males and females, respectively) and was coupled with intention to drop out across all study levels (12.1% of students sampled reported ""seriously considered dropping out""). Perceived stress score predicted a student's intention to withdraw but this association did not transfer to actual withdrawal, suggesting that other factors, most likely coping mechanisms, play a part in mediating the withdrawal behaviour. Unfortunately, despite the seemingly high levels of stress and potential worry over dropout, students are reluctant to seek support and many were unaware of the support services available through the university. Given the engaged nature of these students, their feelings are unlikely to be made known to staff as they will not necessarily register on non-attendance lists or be flagged because of missing assignments, which are often used as indicators of potential problems.

Lasting Solutions for Advancement of Women of Color,"Verduzco-Gutierrez, M; Wescott, S; Amador, J; Hayes, AA; Owen, M; Chatterjee, A","Despite efforts to improve parity in the biomedical workforce, gender bias persists related to equitable pay, promotion, speaking opportunities, journal editorial positions, research funding, and leadership positions. This bias becomes more prominent for women of color and women with other intersectional identities who come from underrepresented groups. It is critical to understand the barriers that women face and why the pathway is especially challenging for women of color. In this commentary, the authors cite research related to the effects of institutional gender bias in academic medicine, including research on bias against women of color. As academic leaders who come from underrepresented groups, the authors are aware that traditional approaches to reducing this bias have not worked well, and they instead highlight promising strategies aimed at filling the pathway to leadership with women of color who are qualified and ready to take the helm. They address solutions to ensure the academic pathway is supportive. They also provide several recommendations, including: offering more opportunities for mentorship and sponsorship, improving access to formal leadership programming, modeling successful upstander initiatives, recognizing the growing role of minority-based medical societies, implementing early-career education, increasing journal editorial board representation, and expanding promotion criteria.

"A Year into the Pandemic: An Update on Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Medicine","Krukowski, RA; Williams, DCM; Cardel, M","The coronavirus pandemic revealed long-standing, unaddressed fissures in our systems, including dramatic gender inequities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Women have disproportionately carried the burden of childcare and other caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic, and there are strong indications that the pandemic will likely exacerbate preexisting disparities in the pipeline of women in STEMM and in leadership positions. Based on a literature review, our own experiences, and the experiences of our colleagues, we review promising strategies that have been implemented by funding bodies, journals, professional societies, and colleges/universities as well as additional strategies that might be helpful for these entities to implement to move forward with policies in place that address gender inequities and rebuild our institutional systems better. At this moment in time, institutions should collect data on metrics such as recruitment, retention, tenure/promotion, funding, professional society membership, awards/honors, and scientific publishing.

Gender Disparity in Full Professor Rank Among Academic Physicians: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Marhoffer, EA; Ein-Alshaeba, S; Grimshaw, AA; Holleck, JL; Rudikoff, B; Bastian, LA; Gunderson, CG","Purpose The gender gap in promotion in academic medicine is well established. However, few studies have reported gender differences in promotion adjusted for scholarly production and national or international reputation, namely, career duration, publications, grant funding, and leadership positions. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the differences between men and women in achieving benchmarks for promotion and analyze where such differences lie geographically and within specialties. Method A systematic search of Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, Cochrane Library, ERIC, GenderWatch, Google Scholar, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from inception to August 17, 2022. All studies that reported the number of male and female full professors on medical school faculty were included. The primary outcome was the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for promotion to full professor for women compared with men. Results Two hundred forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The unadjusted OR for promotion to full professor for women was 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.41). Sixteen studies reported an AOR. The pooled AOR of promotion for women to full professor was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46-0.77). The AOR for promotion to full professor was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.88) in surgery and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.57-1.11) in internal medicine. Statistical heterogeneity was high (Q = 66.6, I-2 = 79.4%, P < .001). On meta-regression, 77% of the heterogeneity was from studies outside the United States, where more disparity was reported (AOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.22-0.38).

It is unclear whether these differences persist.MethodsWe merged data from the Association of American Medical Colleges on all medical school graduates from 1979 through 2013 with faculty data through 2018, and we compared the percentages of women who would be expected to be promoted on the basis of the proportion of women in the graduating class with the actual percentages of women who were promoted. We calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and used adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models to examine the differences between the early cohorts (1979-1997) and the late cohorts (1998-2013).ResultsThe sample included 559,098 graduates from 134 U.S. medical schools. In most of the cohorts, fewer women than expected were promoted to the rank of associate or full professor or appointed to the post of department chair. Findings were similar across basic science and clinical departments. In analyses that included all the cohorts, after adjustment for graduation year, race or ethnic group, and department type, women assistant professors were less likely than their male counterparts to be promoted to associate professor (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.78). Similar sex disparities existed in promotions to full professor (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81) and appointments to department chair (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.54). These sex differences in promotions and appointments did not diminish over time and were not smaller in the later cohorts than in the earlier cohorts. The sex differences were even larger in the later cohorts with respect to promotion to full professor.ConclusionsOver a 35-year period, women physicians in academic medical centers were less likely than men to be promoted to the rank of associate or full professor or to be appointed to department chair, and there was no apparent narrowing in the gap over time.

Racial and Sex Disparities in Resident Attrition Among Surgical Subspecialties,"Haruno, LS; Chen, X; Metzger, M; Lin, CA; Little, MTM; Kanim, LEA; Poon, SC","Importance Racial and sex disparities are prevalent in surgical trainees. Although retrospective studies on resident attrition have been conducted for individual specialties, this study analyzes racial and sex differences in resident attrition among all surgical subspecialties over an 18-year period.Objective To evaluate the racial and sex differences in resident attrition among surgical specialties over an 18-year period.Design, Setting, and Participants This was a large, cross-sectional, database study that analyzed program-reported resident censuses (program information, resident demographics, and attrition status) obtained by the Association of American Medical Colleges from 2001 to 2018 for trainees in surgical residency programs. Data were analyzed from March 20, 2021, to June 8, 2022.Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic trends (including race and ethnicity and sex) for all surgical subspecialty training programs over an 18-year period. Resident attrition includes all-cause withdrawals, dismissals, and transfers to another specialty. Unintended attrition encompasses all withdrawals, dismissals, and transfers except for changing career plans.Results This study included 407 461 program-reported resident years collected from 112 205 individual surgical residents (67 351 male individuals [60.0%]). The mean percentage of female trainees was 40.0% (44 835) and increased over the study period. Sex disparity remained greatest in orthopedic surgery. Residents who were underrepresented in medicine (URiM) comprised 14.9% (16 695) of all surgical trainees but demonstrated a 2.1% decrease over the study period. Overall attrition rate among all specialties was 6.9% (7759), with an unintended attrition rate of 2.3% (2556). Female residents had a significantly higher relative risk (RR) of attrition (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22; P < .001) and unintended attrition (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26; P < .001) compared with their male counterparts. URiM residents were at significantly higher RR for attrition (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.32-1.48; P < .001) and unintended attrition (RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.75-2.11; P < .001) compared with non-URiM residents. The highest attrition (10.6% [746 of 7043]) and unintended attrition (5.2% [367 of 7043]) rates were in Black/African American residents. The lowest attrition and unintended attrition rates were seen in White residents at 6.2% (4300 of 69 323) and 1.8% (1234 of 69 323), respectively. Black/African American residents were at disproportionate risk for attrition (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.53-1.80; P < .001) and unintended attrition (RR, 2.59; 95% CI, 2.31-2.90; P < .001) compared with all other residents.

Representation of Women Physician Deans in US Medical Schools,"Larson, AR; Kan, CK; Silver, JK","Background: Among U.S. medical school deans, there is a wide gender gap, most prominent at the highest levels. We aimed to discover how well women physicians were represented within the pool of women deans compared with the pool of men deans. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 149 allopathic medical schools in the United States. For each school, information was collected on deans' names, titles, genders, and degree(s). Chi-square analyses were performed to determine association between gender and dean ranks. Results: Of the 2559 deans included from 149 medical schools, 1649 (64.4%) were physicians, and of these, women physicians accounted for 634 (38.4%), a significant under-representation (p < 0.00001). In comparison, the 626 nonphysician doctorate-holders of which women accounted for 291 (46.5%, p = 0.061) were equally represented. Of the 284 deans with bachelor's or master's degrees, women accounted for 180 (63.4%), a significant over-representation (p < 0.00001). This difference was most profound at the lower tier (assistant) dean level. A lower tier physician dean was 1.25 times more likely to be a man than a woman, and a higher tier (dean of medical school, senior associate, vice, or associate) physician dean was 1.16 times more likely to be a man.

Although previous research has suggested potential interventions to broadly address gender inequality in medicine, no research has focused on interventions in the field of gastroenterology. The purpose of this research was to engage women in the field of gastroenterology in Canada, to identify interventions with potential to be effective in addressing gender inequality.Methods A World Caf & eacute; was hosted in 2019 to discuss gender inequality and interventions in gastroenterology. Twelve women employed in the field of gastroenterology (i.e. physicians, nurses, research staff, and trainees) were purposively recruited and participated in the event. The discussion rounds were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematic analyses was conducted using Braun and Clarke's principles.Results Three key themes identifying potential interventions to address gender inequality in gastroenterology were generated: (1) Education; (2) Addressing institutional structures and polices; and 3) Role modelling and mentorship. Participants indicated that interventions should target various stakeholders, including both women and men in gastroenterology, young girls, patients, and administrators.Conclusion Many of the interventions identified by participants correspond with existing research on interventions in general medicine, suggesting that institutional changes can be made for maximum effectiveness. Some novel interventions were also identified, including publicizing instances of gender parity and supporting interventions across the educational and professional lifecourse. Moving forward, institutions must assess their readiness for change and evaluate existing policies, programs, and practices for areas of improvement.For a long time, more men have been doctors than women in Canada. We know about this problem in medicine, but not much about it in gastroenterology. This paper talks about ideas that some women in gastroenterology have to fix the problem.

"Gender Differences in Academic Medicine: Retention, Rank, and Leadership Comparisons From the National Faculty Survey","Carr, PL; Raj, A; Kaplan, SE; Terrin, N; Breeze, JL; Freund, KM","Purpose Prior studies have found that women in academic medicine do not advance or remain in their careers in parity with men. The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.Method The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty. Schools were balanced for public or private status and the four Association of American Medical Colleges geographic regions. The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity.Results After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).

Existing research shows that, while men are more likely than women to be promoted at the different stages of the academic career, no such difference is found when it comes to faculty retention rates. Current research on faculty retention, however, focuses on careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We extend this line of inquiry to the social sciences.MethodsWe follow 2,218 tenure-track assistant professors hired since 1990 in seven social science disciplines at nineteen U.S. universities from time of hire to time of departure. We also track their time to promotion to associate and full professor. Using survival analysis, we examine gender differences in time to departure and time to promotion. Our methods account for censoring and unobserved heterogeneity, as well as effect heterogeneity across disciplines and cohorts.ResultsWe find no statistically significant differences between genders in faculty retention. However, we do find that men are more likely to be granted tenure than women. When it comes to promotion to full professor, the results are less conclusive, as the effect of gender is sensitive to model specification.ConclusionsThe results corroborate previous findings about gender patterns in faculty retention and promotion.

"Analysis of Gender-based Differences in Surgery Faculty Compensation, Promotion, and Retention <i>Establishing Equity</i>","Hoops, HE; Brasel, KJ; Dewey, E; Rodgers, S; Merrill, J; Hunter, JG; Azarow, KS","Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate gender-based differences in faculty salaries before and after implementation of a university-wide objective compensation plan, Faculty First (FF), in alignment with Association of American Medical Colleges regional median salary (AAMC-WRMS). Gender-based differences in promotion and retention were also assessed.Summary Background Data: Previous studies demonstrate that female faculty within surgery are compensated less than male counterparts are and have decreased representation in higher academic ranks and leadership positions.Methods: At a single institution, surgery faculty salaries and work relative value units (wRVUs) were reviewed from 2009 to 2017, and time to promotion and retention were reviewed from 1998 to 2007. In 2015, FF supplanted specialty-specific compensation plans. Salaries and wRVUs relative to AAMC-WRMS, time to promotion, and retention were compared between genders.Results: Female faculty (N = 24) were compensated significantly less than males were (N = 62) before FF (P = 0.004). Female faculty compensation significantly increased after FF (P < 0.001). After FF, female and male faculty compensation was similar (P = 0.32). Average time to promotion for female (N = 29) and male faculty (N = 82) was similar for promotion to associate professor (P = 0.49) and to full professor (P = 0.37). Promotion was associated with significantly higher retention for both genders (P < 0.001). The median time of departure was similar between female and male faculty (P = 0.73).Conclusions: A university-wide objective compensation plan increased faculty salaries to the AAMC western region median, allowing correction of gender-based salary inequity.

Estimating Implicit and Explicit Gender Bias Among Health Care Professionals and Surgeons,"Salles, A; Awad, M; Goldin, L; Krus, K; Lee, JV; Schwabe, MT; Lai, CK","IMPORTANCE The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a validated tool used to measure implicit biases, which are mental associations shaped by one's environment that influence interactions with others. Direct evidence of implicit gender biases about women in medicine has yet not been reported, but existing evidence is suggestive of subtle or hidden biases that affect women in medicine.OBJECTIVES To use data from IATs to assess (1) how health care professionals associate men and women with career and family and (2) how surgeons associate men and women with surgery and family medicine.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This data review and cross-sectional study collected data from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2017, from self-identified health care professionals taking the Gender-Career IAT hosted by Project Implicit to explore bias among self-identified health care professionals. A novel Gender-Specialty IAT was also tested at a national surgical meeting in October 2017. All health care professionals who completed the Gender-Career IAT were eligible for the first analysis. Surgeons of any age, gender, title, and country of origin at the meeting were eligible to participate in the second analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Measure of implicit bias derived from reaction times on the IATs and a measure of explicit bias asked directly to participants.RESULTS Almost 1 million IAT records from Project Implicit were reviewed, and 131 surgeons (64.9% men; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [11.5] years) were recruited to complete the Gender-Specialty IAT. Healthcare professionals (n = 42 991; 82.0% women; mean [SD] age, 32.7 [11.8] years) held implicit (mean [SD] D score, 0.41[0.36]; Cohen d = 1.14) and explicit (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.85]; Cohen d = 0.77) biases associating men with career and women with family. Similarly, surgeons implicitly (mean [SD] D score, 0.28 [0.37]; Cohen d = 0.76) and explicitly (men: mean [SD], 1.27 [0.39]; Cohen d = 0.93; women: mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d = 0.53) associated men with surgery and women with family medicine. There was broad evidence of consensus across social groups in implicit and explicit biases with one exception. Women in healthcare (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.86]; Cohen d = 0.77) and surgery (mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d = 0.53) were less likely than men to explicitly associate men with career (B coefficient, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.04; P < .001) and surgery (B coefficient, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.13; P = .001) and women with family and family medicine.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The main contribution of this work is an estimate of the extent of implicit gender bias within surgery. On both the Gender-Career IAT and the novel Gender-Specialty IAT, respondents had a tendency to associate men with career and surgery and women with family and family medicine.

Women's Experiences of Promotion and Tenure in Academic Medicine and Potential Implications for Gender Disparities in Career Advancement A Qualitative Analysis,"Murphy, M; Callander, JK; Dohan, D; Grandis, JR","IMPORTANCE Gender disparities in career advancement in academic medicine have persisted despite gender parity in medical school matriculation. Although numerous explanations for this gap exist, little is known about women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine.OBJECTIVE To examine women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine to uncover mechanisms associated with the gender disparity in career advancement.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this qualitative study, 52 in-depth, semistructured interviews with women academic medicine faculty members were conducted in 2019. The 52 participants were drawn from 16 medical schools across the US. Institutions were selected using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity of geography and ownership (private or public). Within institutions, purposive and snowball sampling were used to seek diversity with respect to respondents' degree type (MD, PhD, and MD and PhD), age, and career stage. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Data analysis was performed from March to December 2020.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Themes and subthemes in participants' experiences of promotion and tenure.RESULTS The 52 women in this study ranged in age from 34 to 82 years (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [10.7] years). Eighteen respondents (34.6%) held an MD, 4 (7.7%) held both an MD and PhD, and 30 (57.7%) held a PhD. Fourteen respondents (26.9%) were assistant professors at the time of the study, 8 (15.4%) were associate professors, and 30 (57.7%) were full professors. Four main themes within participants' experiences of promotion and tenure that pertain to gender inequities were identified: ambiguous or inconsistent criteria for promotion or tenure; lack of standard processes for reviewing applications and making decisions; vulnerability to malicious behavior of senior faculty, department chairs, and division chiefs; and women seeing men have different experiences of advancement.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The respondents' experiences of promotion and tenure suggest that promotion and tenure processes may be characterized by inconsistency and a lack of oversight, which have the potential to contribute to well-documented patterns of gender disparities in career advancement in academic medicine.",2021,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,4,9,,WOS:000698769200006,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25843,,#430,Murphy 2021,"",""
"Women in neurointervention, a gender gap? Results of a prospective online survey","Power, S; Biondi, A; Saatci, I; Bennett, K; Mahadevan, J; Januel, AC; Ayudhaya, SSN; Agid, R","Background and Purpose Women's representation in medicine has increased over time yet the proportion of women practicing neurointervention remains low. We conducted an anonymous online survey through which we could explore the gender gap in neurointervention, identify potential issues, difficulties, or obstacles women might face, and evaluate if men encounter similar issues. Methods An online questionnaire was designed in SurveyMonkey (R). Invitation to participate was emailed through national and international neurointerventional societies as well as directly through private mailing lists to men and women working in neurointervention. Responses were collected from 10 May 2019 to 10 September 2019. Results There were 295 complete responses, 173 (59%) male and 122 (41%) female. Most respondents (83%) fell within age categories 35-60 years, with representation from 40 countries across five continents. In all 95% were working full time, 73% had worked as a neurointerventionalist for >6 years, 77% worked in University-affiliated teaching institutions. Almost half of the respondents indicated no female neurointerventionalist worked in their center. Female respondents were younger and age-adjusted analysis was undertaken. Significantly fewer females than males were married and had children. Significantly fewer females held supervisory roles, held academic titles, and significantly less had a mentor. Females were less satisfied in their careers. More females felt they receive less recognition than colleagues of the opposite sex. Males had a greater proportion of work time dedicated to neurointervention. Similar proportions of both genders experienced bullying in work (40%-47%); however, sexual harassment was more common for females. There were no differences between genders in how they dealt with complications or their effects on mental well-being. Conclusion There are many potential reasons why women are underrepresented in neurointervention, however, the literature suggests this is not unique to our specialty. Multiple long-term strategies will be necessary to address these issues, some of which are discussed in the article.",2022,,INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY,28,3,311-322,WOS:000695256000001,10.1177/15910199211030783,,#433,Power 2022,"",""
"Evaluating a Medical School's Climate for Women's Success: Outcomes for Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion","Villablanca, AC; Li, YJ; Beckett, LA; Howell, LP","Objective: Women are under-represented in academia. Causative factors include challenges of career-family integration. We evaluated factors reflecting institutional culture (promotion, retention, hiring, and biasing language in promotion letters) as part of an intervention to help shift culture and raise awareness of flexibility policies at the University of California, Davis (UCD). Materials and Methods: Data on faculty use of family-friendly policies were obtained at baseline, and surveys for policy awareness were conducted pre(2010)/post(2013) an NIH-funded study educational intervention. Data on hires, separations, and promotions were obtained pre(2007-2009, 2234 person-year data points)/post(2010-2012, 2384 person-year data points) intervention and compared by logistic regression and for gender differences. Department promotion letters (53) were also analyzed for biasing language. Results: Policy use was overall low, highest for female assistant professors, and for maternity leave. Awareness significantly increased for all policies postintervention. Promotions decreased, likely because of increases in advancement deferrals or tenure clock extensions. Pre/postintervention, female and male hires were near parity for assistant professors, but female hires were substantially lower than males for associate (54% less likely, p=0.03) and full professors (70% less likely, p=0.002). Once hired, women were no more likely to separate than men. Fewer associate/full professors separated than assistant professors (p=0.002, p<0.001, respectively), regardless of gender. Language in promotion letters was not gender biased. Conclusions: We demonstrate a shift at UCD toward a culture of work-life flexibility, an environment in which letters of recommendation show very few biased descriptions, and in which assistant professor hiring is gender equitable. At the same time, a decrease in number of faculty members applying for promotion and an imbalance of men over women at senior hires independent of policy awareness may challenge the assumption that family-friendly policies, while promoting flexibility, also have a positive impact on professional advancement.",2017,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,26,5,530-539,WOS:000401623900019,10.1089/jwh.2016.6018,,#434,Villablanca 2017,"",""

Do STEM women feel ethically and emotionally better prepared for their careers than men?,"Bawa, S; Ananthram, S; Bennett, D; Parida, S","Despite a growing imperative for graduates to possess STEM skills, both to boost their employability prospects and their perceived economic value, it is critical to also consider the professional or 'soft skills' that will enable these graduates to thrive in their careers. Ironically, gender differences in personality and occupational choice are larger, not smaller, in more gender-equal countries. This is known as the gender equality paradox and in STEM it highlights the importance of purposeful initiatives throughout the educational trajectory, even in countries with higher levels of gender equality. This study employed an online self-assessment of perceived employability (PE) using a validated instrument and analyzed the data from 2493 STEM students studying at multiple Australian universities. The findings, underpinned by Social Cognitive Careers Theory, indicate that female report greater confidence than their male peers in ethical literacy and in some emotional literacy skills; these are understood to be critical soft skills for STEM graduates. This distinction is more pronounced in the natural and physical sciences and within information technology fields.

#Shemergency: Use of a Professional Development Group to Promote Female Resident Recruitment and Retention,"Khatri, UG; Love, J; Zeidan, A; Hsu, CH; Mills, AM","ProblemGender inequity in academic medicine is a pervasive challenge. Recommendations have been implemented to reduce inequities for female faculty. However, there are no well-established guidelines for the recruitment and retention of female residents.ApproachTo address challenges faced by female physicians and support the recruitment and retention of female residents, female emergency medicine residents and attending physicians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania formed a professional development group (PDG), #Shemergency, in July 2017. From July 2017 to July 2018, this PDG developed events and initiatives for female residents that addressed methods to improve awareness of and develop skills relevant to well-described gender disparities in mentorship, speakership and conference representation, compensation, evaluations, wellness and service, and award recognition.OutcomesOver its first year (July 2017-July 2018), the PDG created a professional community and enhanced mentorship through a number of events and initiatives. The PDG secured funding for 5 residents to attend a national conference and nominated 5 residents and 2 attending physicians for professional organization awards (4 nominees won).Next StepsAfter the first year, the PDG expanded the number of joint activities with both male and female colleagues and organized a citywide event for female residents and faculty representing 5 different residency programs. Future work will focus on sustainability (e.g., holding fundraising events), generalizability (e.g., expanding the gender-disparity areas addressed as well as spreading the model to other programs), developing additional events and initiatives (e.g., expanding the number of joint activities with male colleagues), and outcome assessments (e.g., distributing pre- and postevent surveys).",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,2,216-220,WOS:000529216900019,10.1097/ACM.0000000000002969,,#438,Khatri 2020,"",""
A Qualitative Analysis of Career Advice Given to Women Leaders in an Academic Medical Center,"Farrugia, G; Zorn, CK; Williams, AW; Ledger, KK","Question What advice regarding the workplace and management strategies are perceived as useful to women leaders in academic medicine? Findings In this qualitative study based on responses from 40 women leaders at the Mayo Clinic, we found that advice could be grouped into 4 categories: leadership styles are perceived as having gendered qualities, a strategic process is required to gain leadership skills, conflicts between personal life and the workplace will occur and should not be a deterrent, and leadership pathways for women involve inevitable hurdles. Meaning The findings of this qualitative study suggest that a long-term view of attaining gender equity for women leaders at academic medical centers will require a combination of programs, including disruptive institutional initiatives and grassroots efforts; 1 approach involves highlighting and disseminating career advice received by female leaders, particularly advice that others have found helpful.Importance Women in academic medicine continue to face systemic obstacles on their paths to leadership. In addition to improving recruitment and advancement opportunities, academic medical centers must facilitate a cultural shift that ensures sustained leadership pathways for women. Objective To better understand, from the perspective of women leaders, the workplace and cultural changes that need to take place in academic medicine to increase inclusivity and gender equity. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study of 40 women physicians and administrators with senior leadership roles at Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit academic medical center and research institution with campuses in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota, examined participants' responses to a question regarding their paths to leadership. Replies were submitted between November and December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Women were asked to describe career advice (positive or negative) they had received that was the hardest to accept but, in retrospect, turned out to be valuable. Results Of 40 participants, 25 (63%) were physicians and 15 (37%) were administrators at Mayo Clinic; 27 (68%) had achieved the role of chair or the administrative equivalent. Career experience ranged from 6 to 40 years. Of the 40 women leaders queried, 38 (95%) provided written responses, which were separated into the 4 following categories: leadership styles are perceived as having gendered qualities, attaining leadership skills involves a strategic learning process, collisions between personal life and the workplace should not deter individuals from pursuing leadership roles, and leadership pathways for women involved hurdles. These categories represented a roadmap illuminating perceptions about the academic medical workplace. Conclusions and Relevance These findings link generalizable principles to help to drive new strategies for gender parity. Shifting the culture of academic medicine begins with fully understanding impediments to women's advancement. The advice women leaders recounted offered a roadmap as well as a glimpse of the extra effort required for women to succeed amid some of the system's limitations and obstacles.

Green transition and gender bias: An analysis of renewable energy generation companies in Latin America,"Arias, K; López, D; Camino-Mogro, S; Weiss, M; Walsh, D; Gomes, LG; Hallack, MCM","This study analyzes how the energy transition might change gender bias in power-generating industries. We employ a sample of 102 renewable energy generation companies from six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, and Uruguay. The analysis shows that renewable gen-eration companies with the highest relative efficiency in the labor-capital ratio are those with the highest participation of women. In addition, the results show that renewable companies are incrementing recruitment of women in energy generation; however, their participation is still lower than the sectorial average. Considering the companies' size, bigger renewables companies tend to hire more women, but those women occupy mostly non-technical positions. In addition, women's participation decreases in positions requiring higher education. Women represent 38 % of STEM employees, 54 % of non-STEM employees, and 55 % of non-qualified employees among the total of people employed in generation companies. This trend is even more acute for renewable energy generation companies, where women represent 36 % of STEM employees, 39 % of non-STEM employees, and 48 % of non-qualified employees. Concerning the role of women in decision-making roles within energy companies, wide gender gaps exist in executive and management positions; the proportion of females in the boardroom and in management roles for renewables generation companies was 24 % and 22 %, respectively.

Effects of sexual harassment on advancement of women in academic medicine: A multi-institutional longitudinal study,"Raj, A; Freund, KM; McDonald, JM; Carr, PL","Background: Sexual harassment of women in academic medicine may impede advancement and productivity. This study analyzes the longitudinal effects of sexual harassment on academic advancement and productivity among women.Methods: We undertook a longitudinal analysis to predict effects of sexual harassment reported in 1995 on career outcomes measured in 2012-13, among a sample of women in academic medicine (N =1273) recruited from 24 U.S. medical schools. Measures included survey data from 1995 on sexual harassment (predictor), and 2012-2013 data on retention in academic medicine, rank, leadership positions, and refereed publications (outcomes), captured from surveys and public records. We used multivariable models to test effects of sexual harassment on study outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographics, employment-related variables, and gender discrimination.Findings: In 1995, 54% of women reported any workplace sexual harassment, and 32% of women reported severe harassment (e.g., threats or coercive sexual advances) in the workplace. Multivariable regression models showed no significant effects of sexual harassment. However, severe sexual harassment was associated with higher odds of attaining full professorship by 2012-2013 (AOR: 1.70; 95% CI 1.03, 2.80; p = 0.04).Interpretation: Contrary to our hypothesis, women reporting severe workplace harassment in 1995 were more rather than less likely to advance to full professor. Women seeking advancement may be more vulnerable to sexual harassment in academic medicine vis a vis greater exposure to those who abuse their position of authority.

Female Medical Student Retention in Neurosurgery: A Multifaceted Approach,"Dixon, A; Silva, NA; Sotayo, A; Mazzola, CA","BACKGROUND: Since 2011, more women than men have graduated from medical school, yet there remains a paucity of female physicians in surgical specialties. After the 2018 Neurosurgery Match, only 17.5% of neurosurgery residents are women. Previous literature documented gender inequality, poor medical school exposure, and lack of female mentorship as reasons for this disparity. We sought to further explore factors that deter female medical students from pursuing neurosurgery.METHODS: A comprehensive survey was created and distributed to the 2017-2018 Rutgers New Jersey Medical School student body, requesting anonymous input from female medical students.RESULTS: Of 104 female respondents, 26.9% had considered neurosurgery as a career and felt dissuaded because of their gender. Of respondents, 88% did not have a senior female medical student pursuing neurosurgery or a female neurosurgical resident as a mentor. More than half of respondents disagreed that they would be dissuaded from a field if they did not have a female mentor. The 88.46% of women who felt that there was a glass ceiling in medicine were also more likely to feel that they would face inequality and adversity that would inhibit training in a male-dominated field. Women who described themselves as seeking challenging and competitive careers strongly felt that they would benefit from exposure to surgical subspecialties during their preclinical years.CONCLUSIONS: Female medical students remain resilient, ambitious, interested in competitive specialties, and eager to explore surgical subspecialties during preclinical years.

Little is known regarding leadership representation and recognition within pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine (PCCM), which has similar to 22% women physicians. We sought to understand the landscape of female PCCM leaders.Methods: We abstracted gender of fellowship program directors (PDs), Department of Medicine (DOM) Chairs and Division Chiefs from academic medical centers with PCCM fellowship programs from 2018 and for comparison 2008. We abstracted leadership and recognition award recipients within four PCCM professional societies from 2013 to 2018 (American Thoracic Society [ATS], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM], American College of Chest Physicians [CHEST], and Society of Critical Care Medicine [SCCM]).Results: In 2018, 29% of PCCM PD, 15% of PCCM Division Chiefs, and 15% of DOM Chairs were women. There were significantly more female PDs in 2018 (29%) compared with 2008 (16%, p = 0.04). On average, 25% of society presidents were women, with 28% of PCCM societal awards going to women, with significant difference between societies (p = 0.04). Each society differed in average distribution of female board members over the 6-year period: ATS 38%, AASM 35%, CHEST 18%, and SCCM 44% (p < 0.001).Conclusion: PCCM leadership and societal recognition are disparate by gender with few women holding top leadership roles and receiving societal recognition. Fortunately, the distribution notably is starting to reflect the specialty's demographics.

The educational gradient of obesity increases among Swedish pregnant women: a register-based study,"Bjermo, H; Lind, S; Rasmussen, F","Background: Overweight or obesity is detrimental during pregnancy. We studied time trends in the educational gradient of overweight and obesity among pregnant women. Differences in overweight and obesity by area of residence and country of birth were also examined.Methods: The study was based on the Swedish Medical Birth Register between 1992 and 2010 and included 1,569,173 singleton pregnancies. Weight and height were registered during the first visit at the antenatal-care clinic. Data on education, country of birth, and area of residence were derived from registers with national coverage.Results: In 2008-2010, 32% of Swedish nulliparous pregnant women were overweight or obese. The relative risk of obesity among lower educated women compared to women with higher education increased from 1.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.85-1.97) in 1992-1995 to 2.09 (95% confidence interval: 2.05-2.14) in 2008-2010. There was an inverse linear relationship between risks of overweight or obesity, and population density and type of residence municipality. An excessive gestational weight gain according to the American Institute of Medicine was observed among 57-63% of the overweight or obese women, but there were small differences by education. Pregnant women born in Africa, Middle East or Latin America had higher risks of being overweight or obese compared to women born in Sweden.Conclusions: The prevalence of obesity as well as the social inequalities in obesity during pregnancy increased in Sweden between 1992 and 2010.

Brazilian initiatives for the entry and retention of women in the computing area: a systematic mapping of literature,"Soares, KD; Ribeiro, PVD; Neto, MGD","Despite the growing advancement of initiatives aimed at gender equality in educational and professional circles, women still face obstacles to being accepted and recognized in areas where male activity predominates. This work aims to provide an updated overview of enabling projects that encourage the insertion and retention of women in the area of information technology (IT) in the Brazilian scenario. To this end, a systematic literature mapping (MSL) was carried out, analyzing and classifying 19 (nineteen) articles from a total of 642 (six hundred and forty-two) candidate studies. The results of this study reveal that the most common strategies to promote female insertion and retention focus on training actions, such as offering short courses, lectures and events involving the dissemination of information and qualification. It was observed that the quantitative ones focus on initiatives aimed at academic qualification at undergraduate level. It was also observed the presence of a minority directly focused on the job market.

Gender Differences and Work-Family Conflicts among Emergency Physicians with Intention to Leave,"Wu, YF; Wang, PC; Chen, YC","Backgrounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among intention to leave, emergency physician clinical activities, work-family conflicts, and gender differences in emergency physicians (EPs). Methods. The survey instrument was a self-administered questionnaire containing basic demographic information and characteristics of clinical activities. The work-family conflicts were assessed by the Chinese version of the work-family conflict (WIF) scale. The questionnaires were mailed to board-certified EPs between January 2014 and August 2014. Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test the difference between subgroups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with intention to leave and gender differences. Results. The study included 222 respondents for analysis after exclusions. Compared with physicians not planning to leave, those planning to leave ED practice showed higher dissatisfaction with their clinical work hours (50.0% versus 31.4%, p = 0.035) and night/day shift ratio (52.9% versus 31.0%, p = 0.013) and tended to work with night/day shift ratio exceeding 40% (67.6% versus 45.7%, p = 0.019). Female physicians were more likely to leave ED practice (females versus males, 26.5% versus 10.1%, p = 0.008). A significantly higher level of WIF scale was noted in the group with intention to leave ED practice (3.7 +/- 0.6 versus 3.3 +/- 0.7, p = 0.001). Conclusions. Females and EPs with higher level of WIF scale were more likely to leave emergency clinical practice. Instead of the number of clinical practice hours, the satisfaction with the clinical work hours and night shift frequency were significantly associated with the intention to leave.",2018,,EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL,2018,,,WOS:000449938700001,10.1155/2018/3919147,,#451,Wu 2018,"",""
Gender challenges within the UK Defence Medical Services: recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce,"Swain, C; Evans, C; Kinkaid, ; Keogh, J; Orr, L; King, K","While there are women represented in some notable positions within the UK Defence Medical Services (DMS), the challenges and barriers to successful female progression have not disappeared.

This article seeks to communicate this problem, illustrated by the lived experiences of DMS female doctors, by exploring the six gender bias barriers ('Glass Walls') that hold women back in the workplace. Cultural change requires a determined effort, driven persistently from the top and at every level of leadership and management. The first step requires recognition and acceptance of the problem.

Institutional Culture of Belonging and Attrition Risk Among Women Health Care Professionals,"Schaechter, JD; Starr, JR; Silver, JK","Objective: Attrition of women health care professionals is high, threatening patient care and advances in health care sciences. Women health care professionals have often reported experiencing challenges in the workplace that lower their sense of belonging and may precipitate their attrition. The current study sought to identify dimensions of workplace belonging in women health care professionals and to determine the relative strength of association of these belonging dimensions with intent to leave (ITL) their institution. Methods: Attendees of a continuing education course on women's leadership skills in health care were surveyed about their ITL and workplace belonging experiences. Dimensions of workplace belonging were identified by factor analysis. The strength of association between ITL and each workplace belonging dimension, as well as their relative strengths of association, were assessed in ordinal regression analyses. Results: Women comprised 99% of survey participants. Three dimensions of workplace belonging were identified: ""institutional culture,"" ""interactions with supervisor,"" and ""interpersonal relationships."" More frequent experiences of support in any of the three belonging dimensions associated strongly with lower ITL. When all three belonging dimensions were considered simultaneously, ITL remained strongly related with experiences of a supportive ""institutional culture"" (odds ratio 0.41, p < 0.0001), while it became much less strongly related with supportive experiences in the other two dimensions. Conclusions: These findings suggest a dominant role of institutional culture in attrition risk in women health care professionals.

The objective of this study was to find out the causes of permanence in STEM careers of women, as well as the possible causes of career abandonment towards another STEM or non-STEM career. This was done by analyzing historical data for admission to STEM careers and using an instrument (survey) for data collection carried out in a private university in Mexico. Historical data indicates that only 17% of the total population were women choosing a STEM career. A survey was carried out for 3 months to obtain information on the factors that affect the decision to opt for a STEM career or to remain in it. It was found that men and women prefer inspiring Faculty who motivate them to continue their careers. Factors such as the competitive environment and the difficulty of teaching with less empathetic Faculty were negative and decisive aspects of decision-making. School achievement did not influence the dropout rate of women in STEM careers. The factors of choice and desertion of women in STEM careers were determined, and actions of educational innovation such as mentoring and timely monitoring of already enrolled female students, digital platforms for students and Faculty, awareness workshops for Faculty, and talks with successful women in STEM areas were proposed.",2023,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,10,1,,WOS:000948452100001,10.1057/s41599-023-01588-z,,#454,Ortiz-Martínez 2023,"",""
Women Physicians in Transition Learning to Navigate the Pipeline from Early to Mid-Career: Protocol for a Qualitative Study,"Leung, TI; Wang, KH; Lin, TL; Gin, GT; Pendharkar, S; Chen, CYA","Background: Women physicians face unique obstacles while progressing through their careers, navigating career advancement and seeking balance between professional and personal responsibilities. Systemic changes, along with individual and institutional changes, are needed to overcome obstacles perpetuating physician gender inequities. Developing a deeper understanding of women physicians' experiences during important transition points could reveal both barriers and opportunities for recruitment, retention, and promotion, and inform best practices developed based on these experiences.Objective: The aim is to learn from the experiences and perspectives of women physicians as they transition from early to mid-career, then develop best practices that can serve to support women physicians as they advance through their careers.Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with women physicians in the United States in 2020 and 2021. Eligibility criteria included self-identification as a woman who is in the process of transitioning or who recently transitioned from early to mid-career stage. Purposeful sampling facilitated identification of participants who represented diversity in career pathway, practice setting, specialty, and race/ethnicity. Each participant was offered compensation for their participation. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Interview questions were open-ended, exploring participants' perceptions of this transition. Qualitative thematic analysis will be performed. We will use an open coding and grounded theory approach on interview transcripts.Results: The Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Health, Medicine, and Life Sciences at Maastricht University approved the study; Stanford University expedited review approved the study; and the University of California, San Diego certified the study as exempt from review. Twelve in-depth interviews of 50-100 minutes in duration were completed. Preliminary analyses indicate one key theme is a tension resulting from finite time divided between demands from a physician career and demands from family needs. In turn, this results in constant boundary control between these life domains that are inextricable and seemingly competing against each other within a finite space; family needs impinge on planned career goals, if the boundary between them is not carefully managed. To remedy this, women sought resources to help them redistribute home responsibilities, freeing themselves to have more time, especially for children. Women similarly sought resources to help with career advancement, although not with regard to time directly, but to first address foundational knowledge gaps about career milestones and how to achieve them.Conclusions: Preliminary results provide initial insights about how women identify or activate a career shift and how they marshaled resources and support to navigate barriers they faced. Further analyses are continuing as of March 2022 and are expected to be completed by June 2022.

Pathways of opportunity in STEM: comparative investigation of degree attainment across different demographic groups at a large research institution,"Costello, RA; Salehi, S; Ballen, CJ; Burkholder, E","BackgroundWe used an opportunity gap framework to analyze the pathways through which students enter into and depart from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees in an R1 higher education institution and to better understand the demographic disparities in STEM degree attainment.ResultsWe found disparities in 6-year STEM graduation rates on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education level. Using mediation analysis, we showed that the gender disparity in STEM degree attainment was explained by disparities in aspiration: a gender disparity in students' intent to pursue STEM at the beginning of college; women were less likely to graduate with STEM degrees because they were less likely to intend to pursue STEM degrees. However, disparities in STEM degree attainment across race/ethnicities and parental education level were largely explained by disparities in attrition: persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) and first generation students were less likely to graduate with STEM degrees due to fewer academic opportunities provided prior to college (estimated using college entrance exams scores) and more academic challenges during college as captured by first year GPAs.ConclusionsOur results reinforce the idea that patterns of departure from STEM pathways differ among marginalized groups.

Meeting the Needs of Mid-Career Women in Academic Medicine: One Model Career Development Program,"Chaudron, LH; Anson, E; Tolbert, JBM; Inoue, S; Cerulli, C","Background: A gender gap in leadership exists in academic medicine. Medical school faculty rosters indicate an overrepresentation of women in entry-level positions. As positions increase in seniority and leadership responsibilities, there is an underrepresentation of women. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully understood, but the mid-career transition is one career point that some scholars hypothesize is part of the leaky pipeline. The University of Rochester Medical Center developed a career development program (CDP) to focus on this pivotal career developmental time period. We assessed the impact of the CDP on self-assessed knowledge, competence, self-identified goals, and promotions.Materials and Methods: Four cohorts of mid-career women completed preself-assessment and postself-assessment and ranked their current knowledge and competence on 11 topics grouped into 3 career development domains. They identified three personal goals and ranked their success in achieving them at the end of the program. Facilitators followed participants annually for promotions and accomplishments.Results: Fifty-one participants reported statistically significant improvements in knowledge and competency in all domains-promotional, organizational infrastructure, and communication. They identified 148 individual goals that we grouped into 4 categories: career development (32%), leadership (26%), networking (22%), and negotiation (20%), and the majority achieved their individual goals.

Satisfaction of Women Faculty in Academic Medicine,"Chaudron, LH; Dandar, V; Lautenberger, D; Bunton, SA; Gordon, LK; Ellinas, EH","Purpose: Research about academic medicine women faculty has focused on comparisons of men and women or specific groups who achieved leadership. To better understand the low percentages of women in academic medicine leadership, attention should be paid to the career continuum within genders. Study findings will inform policies and programs to support women in building careers and acquiring leadership positions. Materials and Methods: Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) StandPoint Faculty Engagement Survey data are used to describe and compare women assistant, associate and full professors' perceptions of (1) career development and advancement opportunities, and (2) a culture and climate that fosters diversity, equity, and inclusion. Specific similarities and differences with men are highlighted. Results: Fifty-nine percent of women respondents were assistant, 25% associate, and 16% full professors. Associate professors of both genders were the least satisfied on the main measures. Women were less satisfied than men at each career stage across the majority of variables. Among women, fewer than half of full and associate professors, and 52% of assistant professors believe they can express their opinions without fear of retribution. While the majority at all ranks (69%-75%) report feeling respected in the workplace, among those who did not, the highest percentage of disrespect based on gender was among associate professors. Conclusions: The perceptions of >7,500 academic medicine women faculty, representing different generations and ranks, underscore the need to broadly address gender inequity and sexism throughout the career continuum. It identifies the mid-career stage as a challenging experience for both men and women.

The presence of this disparity has not been investigated in training programs.OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of a gender disparity in award winners in general surgery residency programs.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective survey study, 32 geographically diverse academic and independent general surgery residency programs were solicited for participation. The 24 participating programs (75.0%) submitted deidentified data regarding the gender distribution of residents and trainee award recipients for the period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed from September 11, 2017, to December 21, 2018.EXPOSURES: Time and the proportion of female trainees.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage of female award winners. A multilevel logistic regression model accounting for the percentage of female residents in each program compared the odds of a female resident winning an award relative to a male resident. This analysis was repeated for the first and second decades of the study. Award winners were further analyzed by type of award (clinical excellence, nonclinical excellence, teaching, or research) and selection group (medical students, residents, or faculty members).RESULTS: A total of 5030 of 13 760 resident person-years (36.6%) and 455 of 1447 award winners (31.4%) were female.

"Sticky Floor, Broken Ladder, and Glass Ceilling: Gender and Racial Trends Among Neurosurgery Residents","Maqsood, H; Younus, S; Naveed, S; Chaudhary, AMD; Khan, MT; Khosa, F","IntroductionDiversity and equity in academic medicine are critically important in improving healthcare standards and patient-related outcomes. Gender and racial disparities are some major challenges faced by the health system. This article reviews the gender and racial trends among residents of neurosurgery in the United States (US).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the data extracted from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)'s annual Data Resource Books from 2007 to 2019. ACGME cataloged gender as men and women and race/ethnicity was categorized as White/non-Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Island, Hispanic, Black/non-Hispanic, Native American/Alaskan, others, and unknown. Counts, proportions, relative, and absolute percentage changes were calculated to highlight trends in resident appointments over time and across the specialty of neurosurgery.ResultsThe number of female residents increased steadily from 10.6% in 2007 to 19.3% in 2019; with an absolute increase of 8.74%, a relative increase of 63.9%, and a simultaneous decrease in male residents. When averaged across the nine-year study period, 51% of the study sample was White (non-Hispanic), followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders at 15.2%. The representation of Hispanics was 4.3%, Black/African Americans were 4.5%, Native Americans/Alaskans were 0.2%, and others were 8% of the total study population.ConclusionOur study concludes that gender and racial disparity persist within the neurosurgery residency training programs in the US. Concrete efforts at all academic levels are needed to provide greater support for the females and for the careers of underrepresented minority (URM) trainees to ensure their increased representation in neurosurgery.",2021,,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,13,9,,WOS:000701753900027,10.7759/cureus.18229,,#466,Maqsood 2021,"",""
A TIME HAZARD ANALYSIS OF STUDENT PERSISTENCE: A US UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE MATHEMATICS MAJOR EXPERIENCE,"Bahi, S; Higgins, D; Staley, P","Individual level data for the entire cohort of undergraduate mathematics students of a relatively small US public university was used to estimate the risk that a student will switch major to another one before degree completion. The data set covers the period from 1999 to 2006. Survival tables and logistic models were estimated and used to discuss student's switch from their initially planned mathematics major to another. An important goal of low enrollment university departments is to increase enrollment and to attain a high retention rate. Major switching indicates a failure of these departments to retain potentially able students. Students' retention is also an important issue for university programs evaluation and funding. The goal of this work is to investigate the timing of switching major, to a different one, by mathematics students. We estimated the probability of occurrence of this event for different school terms and when this event is most likely to occur. The empirical results suggest that the probability of a mathematics student switching major varies from a high 23 % early in student's major enrollment to a low of about 6 % in later semesters. Mathematics education majors, however, showed inferior risk of switching major. Gender differences were also examined, showing no significant gender differences.",2015,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION,13,5,1139-1160,WOS:000361484800009,10.1007/s10763-014-9538-9,,#467,Bahi 2015,"",""
Trends in Racial and Gender Profiles of United States Academic Emergency Medicine Faculty: Cross-Sectional Survey From 2007 to 2018,"Shaikh, AT; Lall, MD; Jalal, S; Raja, AS; Fares, S; Siddiqi, J; Khosa, F","Background: Numerous studies have reported existing disparities in academic medicine. The purpose of this study was to assess racial and gender disparity in aca-demic emergency medicine (EM) faculty positions across the United States from 2007 to 2018. Objective: The primary objective was to identify the racial and ethnic and gender distributions across academic ranks in EM. The secondary objective was to describe the racial and gender proportions across different tenure tracks and degrees. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the As-sociation of American Medical Colleges. Simple descriptive statistics and time series analysis were employed to assess the trends and relationship between race and gender across aca-demic rank, type of degree, and tenure status. Results: When averaged, 75% of all faculty members were White physicians and 67.5% were male. Asian faculty members showed an increased representation in the lower academic ranks and underrepresented minority groups demonstrated a small in-crease. Asian faculty members demonstrated a significantly increasing trend at the level of instructor ( t = 0.02; p = 0.034; 95% CI 0.05-1.03). Female faculty members showed a signif-icantly decreasing trend over the study period ( t =-0.01; p < 0.001; 95% CI 0.68-0.75). White academic physicians and male faculty members made up most of all degree types and tenure categories. Conclusions: Despite an increase in pro-portional representation, the underrepresentation of female faculty members and those from minority groups persists in emergency medicine. Further studies are needed to identify and address the root causes of these differences. (c) 2022 El-sevier Inc.

Women in Neurosurgery: From a Matter of Fortuitous Occasions Toward a Conscious Choice,"Graziano, F; Gerardi, RM; Scalia, G; Cammarata, G; Nicoletti, GF; Chaurasia, B; Umana, GE","BACKGROUND: Medicine has made progress toward gender equality and has achieved almost equal distribution between men and women among graduates. However, more still needs to be done because most surgical sub-specialties are still lacking adequate female representation and this persisting gender gap is particularly evident in both practical neurosurgery and the academic world. Gradual advancements have enabled a few women to pursue a successful career in neurologic surgery, pairing clinical practice with mentoring and involvement in academic research. These efforts show that more needs to be done to bridge the historic and current gap, which has recently aroused increasing interest among the neurosurgical community through internationally relevant studies. In neurosurgical societies worldwide, the existence of gender-related issues and women-reserved sections has started to attract attention and recognition on how to properly address this issue among present and future neurosurgeons.METHODS: In this study, we discuss the timeline of women's road to gaining their place in neurosurgery, inspired by Hippocrates' motto ""Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future."" Although neurosurgery had been traditionally considered too difficult a subject in which to engage, the first female neurosurgeons challenged themselves in this field, previously reserved only for men, at a time when society was not yet ready to embrace women's presence. Their successes paved the way for future generations of women, progressively shedding light on complex themes such as peer considerations, difficulty in reaching academic positions, and work-life balance.RESULTS: Our aim is to analyze the historic reasons for inequality among men and women, which might be found in the themes of personal choice and willingness, aside from cultural bias or stereotypically based thinking.CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, if the difference in numbers were considered a reality related to personal inclination, perhaps, nobody would pay attention to this topic and the presence of even a few women in neurosurgery would be considered less strange. By thinking along those lines on a daily basis, we could all simply write about the history of valuable neurosurgeons in the past, present, and future without any distinction between men and women.",2021,,WORLD NEUROSURGERY,148,,129-135,WOS:000631732900103,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.01.049,,#470,Graziano 2021,"",""
Gendered Expectations: Do They Contribute to High Burnout Among Female Physicians?,"Linzer, M; Harwood, E","Patients have differing expectations of female versus male physicians. Female patients tend to seek more empathic listening and longer visits, especially with female physicians; however, female doctors are not provided more time for this. Female doctors have more female patients than male doctors, and more patients with psychosocial complexity. We propose that gender differences in patient panels and gendered expectations of female physicians may contribute to the high rate of burnout among female clinicians, as well as to the many female physicians working part-time to reduce stress in their work lives. We propose several mechanisms for addressing this, including brief increments in visit time (20, 30 and 40 min), staff awareness, training in patient expectations during medical school, adjusting for patient gender in compensation plans, and co-locating behavioral medicine specialists in primary care settings. Beneficial outcomes could include fewer malpractice suits, greater patient satisfaction, higher quality care, and lower burnout among female physicians.",2018,,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,33,6,963-965,WOS:000433497500042,10.1007/s11606-018-4330-0,,#472,Linzer 2018,"",""

Currently, higher education is important in the training of highly qualified specialists, the creation of new knowledge, and the introduction of innovations. Objectives. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the indicators characterizing the gender structure of scientific and pedagogical personnel in higher educational institutions of various countries. These indicators were the share of female teachers in the total number of teachers of higher educational institutions. Methodology. We used data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics for 107 countries. We used the density functions of the normal distribution as models. Results. The results of the computational experiment showed that the share of female teaching staff in the number of scientific and pedagogical staff on average in the countries under consideration was 41.6%. Women make up more than half of the teaching staff in twenty-four countries. The predominance of men as teachers of higher education institutions was in seventy-eight countries. The countries with the maximum and minimum values of such indicators as the share of female teachers in the scientific and pedagogical staff were identified.

Clinician-Investigator Training and the Need to Pilot New Approaches to Recruiting and Retaining This Workforce,"Hall, AK; Mills, SL; Lund, PK","Clinician-investigators, also called physician-scientists, offer critical knowledge and perspectives that benefit research on basic science mechanisms, improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, population and outcomes medicine, health policy, and health services, yet few clinically trained health professionals pursue a research career. Sustaining this workforce requires attention to the unique challenges faced by investigators who must achieve clinical and research competence during training and their careers. These challenges include the duration of required clinical training, limited or discontinuous research opportunities, high levels of educational debt, balancing the dual obligations and rewards of clinical care and research, competition for research funding, and the need for leadership development after training. Women and individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups comprise a small percentage of this workforce.The authors summarize the recent literature on training for clinician-investigators, emphasizing approaches with encouraging outcomes that warrant broader implementation. Using this overview as background, they convened three workshops at the National Institutes of Health in 2016 to identify and refine key priorities for potential new pilot programs to recruit and retain the clinician-investigator workforce. From these workshops emerged three priorities for future pilot programs: (1) support for research in residency, (2) new research on-ramps for health professionals at multiple career stages, and (3) national networks to diversify and sustain clinician-investigator faculty.

Hidden patterns Using social network analysis to track career trajectories of women STEM faculty,"Collins, R; Steffen-Fluhr, N","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe how one group of ADVANCE Project researchers investigated faculty co-authorship networks to identify relationships between women's positions in these networks, their research productivity and their advancement at the university - and to make those relationships transparent.Design/methodology/approach Multiple methods for capturing faculty network data were evaluated, including collecting self-reported data and mining bibliometric data from various web-based sources. Faculty co-authorship networks were subsequently analyzed using several methodologies including social network analysis (SNA), network visualizations and the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator.Findings Results suggest that co-authorship provides an important way for faculty to signal the value of their work, meaning that co-authoring with many others may be beneficial to productivity and promotion. However, patterns of homophily indicate that male faculty tend to collaborate more with other men, reducing signaling opportunities for women. Visualizing these networks can assist faculty in finding and connecting with new collaborators and can provide administrators with unique views of the interactions within their organizations. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival studies showed longitudinal differences in the retention and advancement of faculty based on gender.Originality/value Together, these findings begin to shed light on subtle differences that, over time, may account for the significant gender disparities at STEM institutions, patterns which should be investigated and addressed by administrators.

What Women Need: a Study of Institutional Factors and Women Faculty's Intent to Remain in Academic Medicine,"Onumah, C; Wikstrom, S; Valencia, V; Cioletti, A","Background A longstanding gender gap exists in the retention of women in academic medicine. Several strategies have been suggested to promote the retention of women, but there are limited data on impacts of interventions. Objective To identify what institutional factors, if any, impact women faculty's intent to remain in academic medicine, either at their institutions or elsewhere. Design A survey was designed to evaluate institutional retention-linked factors, programs and interventions, their impact, and women's intent to remain at their institutions and within academic medicine. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics and regression analyses. Participants Women with faculty appointments within departments of medicine recruited from national organizations and specific social media groups. Main Measures Institutional factors that may be associated with women's decision to remain at their current institutions or within academic medicine. Key Results Of 410 surveys of women at institutions across the USA, fair and transparent family leave policies and opportunities for work-life integration showed strong associations with intent to remain at one's institution (leave policies: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.20-4.18, p = 0.01; work-life: OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.50-9.64, p < 0.001) and within academic medicine (leave policies: OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.09-5.03, p = 0.03; work-life: OR 4.66, 95% CI 2.04-11.36, p < 0.001).

Methods. The present study draws on five years of linked secondary and post-secondary administrative records and includes the academic records for 18,814 students attending 228 high schools across 24 jurisdictions in Maryland. We used a series of multilevel models (MLM) to address the research question. Results.

In addition, receiving English language learner services and graduating from high school in the fifth-year functioned as protective factors linked to a reduced likelihood of needing math remediation. Conclusions/Contributions. Community colleges are functionally dependent upon secondary schools to prepare the student body for college level coursework. As such, preventing the need for remediation among community college students will not be resolved within institutional siloes and will most probably require some degree of inter-system collaboration.

Compared with White faculty (median retention, 9.91 years; 95% CI, 9.83-9.92 years), multiracial and faculty of other races had the lowest retention (median retention, 5.42 years; 95% CI, 5.33-5.55 years), followed by Alaska Native, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (median retention, 6.00 years; 95% CI, 5.62-6.62 years), Black (median retention, 7.78 years; 95% CI, 7.50-8.00 years), Asian (median retention, 8.00 years; 95% CI, 8.00-8.11 years) and Hispanic faculty (median retention, 9.00 years; 95% CI, 8.75-9.16 years). Women faculty in the 1970s were 20% more likely than men to leave academia, whereas women in the 2010s had no greater risk of leaving, mainly due to a decline in retention of men. Conclusions and Relevance Gender differences in faculty retention have decreased in the most recent decade; however, men had lower retention compared with earlier cohorts. In this study, faculty who were underrepresented in medicine left academic medicine a median of 1 to 4 years earlier than White faculty. Greater attrition among men and women for recent cohorts suggests that enhanced retention efforts are imperative to maintain an experienced and diverse faculty.",2024,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,7,11,,WOS:001355853700004,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.45143,,#485,Scheuermann 2024,"",""

Our primary objective is to describe the impact of a national woman-focused organization for academic emergency physicians on retention and advancement. Methods We conducted semistructured interviews of past and present organization leaders, as well as members at varying stages in their careers. Physicians with experience in qualitative methods conducted interviews and coded all transcripts using inductive content analysis techniques. Themes were reviewed and discussed to ensure consensus. Results We performed 17 interviews lasting 20 to 30 minutes each, resulting in 476 total minutes of transcript. Participants represented varying stages of career experience, ranging from 2 to 35 years since residency completion (median = 9.5 years). Median years of participation in the woman-focused organization was 10 years. Over half (53%) of participants were past presidents of the organization. The dominant themes encompassed facilitating academic advancement through scholarly productivity, leadership experiences, awards, and promotions; mentorship and sponsorship; peer support and collaborations; reduced professional isolation; and initiatives to address systemic gender inequities and challenges, including strategies to navigate bias, promote pay equity, and advocate for family-friendly workplace policies. Discussion Active participation in a woman-focused professional organization enhances members' career retention and advancement by creating opportunities and relationships that facilitate leadership, enabling scholarly work to advance equity and inclusion, and cultivating a sense of belonging.

Less clear is the extent to which this positive PLTL effect varies across different subgroups of the population. The current study aims to deepen our understanding of the overall PLTL effect by extensively evaluating an optional PLTL program associated with General Chemistry I at a private, research university. Using five years of exam data, this study disaggregates the PLTL effect by demographics (sex and race), academic preparation (math skills, chemistry content knowledge, and experience with college-preparatory coursework), and participation in another curricular innovation (a growth-mindset intervention). Results revealed that the positive effect of PLTL was comparable across demographic identity groups. Thus, the PLTL program benefitted all participants but did not reduce the pre-existing performance disparity between under represented minority and white students (no sex-based disparity was observed). In terms of academic preparation, the PLTL effect interacted with students' level of experience with college-preparatory coursework but not with their math or chemistry knowledge. This pattern suggests that PLTL may help develop students' self-management or reasoning skills, without necessarily narrowing knowledge gaps. Finally, PLTL interacted with participation in a growth-mindset intervention: the difference between PLTL participants and nonparticipants was smaller among students who received the mindset intervention.

Cooperatives in Education: Teacher Job Satisfaction and Gender Differences,"Martínez-León, I; Olmedo-Cifuentes, I; Arcas-Lario, N; Zapata-Conesa, J","ObjectivesCooperatives whose activity is undertaken in the field of education need to optimize their management to survive and achieve competitive advantage. As they are labor-intensive organizations that provide services with high intangibility (transformation knowledge, characteristics and individuals' behavior), their staff's job satisfaction is one way of achieving these advantages (reputation, strategic positioning, attracting talented employees, etc.). Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze how education cooperatives can achieve job satisfaction through certain human resources management practices (work-life balance culture and availability of work-life balance practices, hiring, training, performance assessment and compensation). The gender perspective is also considered in the analysis.MethodologyAn empirical study conducted with the data obtained from a sample of 101 teachers from education cooperatives in the Murcia Region (Spain) (5% response rate). Data were collected by a personal survey that included measures used in previous studies. They were all assessed with a 7-point Likert scale (1: totally disagree, and 7: totally agree) according to teachers' perception of the different variables.Teachers' job satisfaction, measured according to: professional satisfaction (with the school and learning activities), satisfaction with student achievement, teachers' experience in the educational center, and treatment received by the center.Work-life balance culture, divided into positive and negative perspectives. The positive one includes: talking about personal life at work, starting a family -expecting a child or adopting it-, leaving the workplace to care for children or dependent family members, and prolonging maternity/paternity leave. The negative work-life balance culture includes: maintaining a family structure that requires a lot of involvement, spending many hours at work on a daily basis, taking work home regularly, and prioritizing work over private life.Work-life balance practices, with measures adapted to the context (education cooperatives) to specifically ask about a reduced working day with a cut in salary, maternity/paternity leave longer than the legal minimum, leave of absence to care for either sick or dependent family members or sick or dependent children.Hiring, assessed according to teachers' perception of if: recruiting processes that are rigorous and formalized, teachers' continuity is high, and appropriate teachers are hired at each school level.The variable training, measured by considering if training actions are carried out according to the teaching staff's needs, training plans are tailored to the teaching staff, and the training suggestions made by the teaching staff are taken into account.Performance assessment, to consider if the objectives to be met are communicated to those responsible for achieving them, the performance and development of each teacher's activity are evaluated, and if the evaluation of teachers' performance is adequate.Finally, the variable compensation includes the perception of whether the performance evaluation is linked to the salary paid, the salary paid is independent of the teaching staff's performance, and salaries are at similar to those paid to public school teachers.The descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations of the variables are included, as is a hierarchical linear regression model to test the hypotheses. The general model obtained with all the sample data is also analyzed by taking into account gender as a selection variable.ResultsThe study results reveal that adequate training (beta=.478) and rigorous formalized hiring (beta=.336) are the most valued factors to generate job satisfaction among teachers of education cooperatives in the Murcia Region. However, some gender differences appear in the variables that generate job satisfaction, despite there being no significant differences between male and female teachers' perception of their job satisfaction.In particular, male teachers (31% of the sample) negatively perceive the effect of availability of work-life balance practices (beta=-. 238) and compensation (beta=-. 374) on their job satisfaction, while training has a positive impact (beta=.706). These variables explain 52.6% of the male teachers' job satisfaction variation. For the female teachers (69% of the sample), hiring (beta=.440), training (beta=.345) and work-life balance practices (beta=.233) have a positive effect on their perceived job satisfaction, and explain 63.8% of the variation in their job satisfaction.From these gender results, the most striking aspect is that the greater availability of work-life balance practices and linking pay to performance reduce male teachers' job satisfaction. One explanation could be that males consider that work-life balance practices only benefit women, and when female teachers use these measures, male teachers must face a heavier workload, which affects their level of satisfaction. The negative relationship between satisfaction and performance assessment may be a consequence of the service type (training), and the possible uncertainty and mistrust that a performance measure can generate because the methods to determine it are not the most suitable ones, or do not reflect all the work they do to perform their teaching activity.Females differ for the idea that hiring and work-life balance practices are a key influence on their job satisfaction. Perhaps the females in the Spanish studied region still assume the reproduction and care role of the family to a greater extent, and the tools that support their labor participation, such as work-life balance practices, possibly have a positive effect on their perceived satisfaction. Additionally, hiring is the most important factor that generates job satisfaction among females. Rigorous formalized processes where the most appropriate candidates are hired, with a high probability of continuity, are well assessed by females as a way to assure gender equality and to banish certain gender stereotypes, occupational segregation (horizontal and vertical) and the glass ceiling.In any case, both males and females agree that training is essential for their job satisfaction, perhaps because this will improve the education service that they provide, as well as their students performing better.Practical conclusions and original valueThis work offers guidelines to education cooperatives about the aspects that create more job satisfaction, and how to manage and optimize it according to each employee's gender.This work shows some gender differences among teachers of educational cooperatives in relation to the variables that generate their job satisfaction. These differences must be carefully analyzed by the management of cooperatives in an attempt to develop those human resource management policies and strategies that tend to favor high job satisfaction among male and female teachers given its effect on other variables, e.g. performance (better service provision, perception of higher quality), productivity or the cooperative's outcomes (attracting new customers, better internal and external reputation, etc.).In general, education cooperatives can increase job satisfaction by mainly offering a training program suited to teachers' needs that can be put into practice, if possible, in their working hours, and that does not require travel, to avoid work-life conflict problems. This should be complemented with formalized rigorous hiring processes that ensure having highly trained motivated staff. The different perception of work-life practices between males and females shows a clear need for more training and awareness about work-life balance issues and co-responsibility. Educational cooperatives should put the necessary resources (hiring temporary staff to cover possible reductions in days, leave, or absence) so teachers' satisfaction (and productivity) does not disturb those situations.The importance of education cooperatives, together with their labor-intensive character and the absence of studies that analyze the problems addressed herein, justify their relevance from both the academic and business points of view.",2018,,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,94,,31-60,WOS:000455955600003,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.94.12700,,#499,Martínez-León 2018,"",""

This likely exacerbates the lack of diversity in our field. The aims of this study were to (1) characterize demographic composition in orthopaedic residency from 2001 to 2018 and (2) determine the race/ethnicity and identify any disparities.Methods: Demographic and attrition data from 2001 to 2018 were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Attrition data comprised the following categories: withdrawals, dismissals, and transfers to another specialty. Analysis compared demographic composition and determined attrition rates with subgroup analysis by race/ethnicity and sex.Results: From 2001 to 2018, female orthopaedic residents increased from 8.77% to 15.54% and URiM residents from 9.49% to 11.32%. The overall and unintended attrition rates in orthopaedic surgery were 3.20% and 1.15%, respectively. Among female residents, the overall and unintended attrition rates were 5.96% and 2.09% compared with 2.79% and 1.01%, respectively, in male residents. URiM residents had overall and unintended attrition rates of 6.16% and 3.11% compared with 2.71% and 0.83%, respectively, for their White counterparts. Black/African American residents had an attrition rate of nearly 10%. Female residents averaged 12.9% of all residents but 24% of those leaving orthopaedics. URiM residents were 10.14% of all residents but 19.51% of those experiencing attrition. In logistic regression models, female residents had a relative risk (RR) of 2.20 (p < 0.001) for experiencing all-cause attrition and 2.09 (p < 0.001) for unintended attrition compared with male residents.

Calling it quits: a longitudinal study of factors associated with dropout among doctoral students,"Glorieux, A; Spruyt, B; Minnen, J; van Tienoven, TP","This article investigates whether experiences of the PhD trajectory during the first year of enrolment predict dropout during a later stage. More specifically, we studied how supervisor support, time pressure and passion for research relate to dropout among PhD students and assessed the role of discipline in this process. We used longitudinal data from four waves of the PhD Survey (2018 through 2021; N = 589), conducted at a university in Belgium, as well as administrative data on the enrolment status. Results show that supervisor support is negatively related to dropout, and that this is especially important for PhD students in the human sciences. Time pressure is positively related to dropout. When stratified by scientific discipline, this effect was only significant for PhD students in human sciences and in the life sciences and medicine. Passion for research showed a negative association with dropout. Stratification by discipline showed that this effect was only found among PhD students in natural sciences and engineering. Furthermore, teaching assistants showed higher dropout rates, and female PhD students in human sciences and life sciences and medicine were less likely to drop out.",2024,,STUDIES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION,,,,WOS:001159601300001,10.1080/0158037X.2024.2314694,,#508,Glorieux 2024,"",""

Specifically, women are underrepresented in recruitment and retention at every stage of the academic to professional pipeline. Mentoring programs can improve women's motivation and persistence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career pathways. However, mentorship programs consist of multiple components that vary in complexity and cost, which can limit scalability. Here we present results from a randomized experiment with 158 undergraduate women majoring in a geoscience field to identify the critical elements of a successful mentorship program. The combination of three factors was necessary to increase mentoring, motivation, and persistence: inspiration through exposure to geoscience careers via female role models, inoculation through training on how to grow their mentor network and overcome obstacles, and an introduction to a local female geoscientist mentor. To retain women in geoscience careers, exposure to role models, training on network growth and introduction to mentors in combination improve outcomes for undergraduates, according to a randomized intervention experiment.",2020,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,1,1,,WOS:000648605100007,10.1038/s43247-020-0005-y,,#509,Hernandez 2020,"",""

In all cases, Flipped classroom (FC) built on information and communications technology was used. The objective of this paper is to analyse if the gain in the BEMA pre and post-test results is influenced by several factors such as the degree, the students' academic grade, and gender. Moreover, as some studies have shown that the students' retention of the concepts was significantly stronger in active learning than in traditional approaches, a third BEMA test was performed by the students to analyse the long-term retention gain dependence on the same factors. Students from different engineering degree programs were asked to complete two BEMA tests during the course and a third one after a few months. ANOVA tests were used to analyse the existence of significant differences in gain between student degree programs, student academic level and student gender. Results have shown no differences in the BEMA performance by degree program, but significant differences were found by academic level and gender. Retention did not depend on the degree course but on the academic level. Mean gain value by academic level, and gender was obtained and concluded that the best students presented the best gain results and that gain depends on the students' gender: males outperformed females in the BEMA tests, although there were no significant differences in the course grades.

"Amplifying Their Voice: Inclusive Healthcare Provider Perspectives to Improve Advancement, Resilience, and Retention","Breuner, C; Moore, E; Walsh, E; Hilman, S; Mitzel, J; Thomas, A; Walker-Harding, L","Background and objectives: Addressing the issues of workplace advancement, resilience, and retention within medicine is crucial for creating a culture of equity, respect, and inclusivity especially towards women and nonbinary (WNB) providers including advanced practice providers (APPs), most notably those from marginalized groups. This also directly impacts healthcare quality, patient outcomes, and overall patient and employee satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to amplify the voices on challenges faced by WNB providers within a pediatric academic healthcare organization, to rank workplace interventions addressing advancement, resilience, and retention highlighting urgency towards addressing these issues, and, lastly, to provide suggestions on how to improve inclusivity. Methods: Participants were self-identified WNB providers employed by a pediatric healthcare organization and its affiliated medical university. An eligibility screener was completed by 150 qualified respondents, and 40 WNBs actually participated in study interviews. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide to rank interventions targeted at improving equity, with time allotted for interviewees to discuss their personal lives and how individual circumstances impacted their professional experiences. Results: WNB providers called for efficient workflows and reducing uncompensated job demands. Support for family responsibilities, flexible financial/compensation models, and improved job resources all were endorsed similarly. Participants ranked direct supervisor and leader support substantially lower than other interventions. Conclusions: Career mentorship and academic support for WNB individuals are recognized interventions for advancement and retention but were not ranked as top priorities.

The purpose of the study is to examine the gender attrition rate differences among Estate Management students of Universities within South-West, Nigeria being one of the fields within the STEM range of discipline scope since it has a scientific focus. The enrolment and graduation list of the students was used to determine the attrition rate of Estate Management student by gender. This is for a period of five (5) years garnered from three universities in South-West Nigeria namely: Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, University of Lagos, Akoka and Covenant University, Ota. These Universities fall within the group of universities that have produced reasonable number of graduates over time, up to ten sets of graduates over the period 2007 and 2016. However, this study will only consider five sets due to constraints in assessing the needed data. The study applied quantitative data using descriptive statistics such as tables, percentages and mean. The findings are in correspondence with what obtains in literature [2] that female student's attrition is higher in fields that are male-dominated. Since Estate Management is male dominated (as seen from the figures), the attrition rate of females is more in the universities sampled.

Nationwide there are shortages in family medicine and AI physicians, and MSD is a leader in these outcomes.METHODS: This is a longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis of 1972-2009 MSD graduates using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression to determine relationships between gender, race, age, and hometown and outcomes of family medicine specialty, rural practice, and rural family medicine practice.RESULTS: MSD graduate outcomes are significantly higher than other US medical schools but declining, 47% chose family medicine and 37% chose a rural first practice location. Selection of rural and family medicine declined more rapidly for men than women, but there was no overall gender difference. AI graduates had rates of rural family medicine similar to their white classmates and older AI students were more likely to select rural family medicine. Graduates from rural hometowns were more likely to select rural practice but not to practice family medicine.CONCLUSIONS: MSD culture and curricula produce AI, family medicine, and rural physicians, but the school is experiencing a downward trend. Understanding the relationship between demographics and outcomes over time will assist policy makers and educators in optimizing strategies to develop the rural family medicine workforce.",2017,,FAMILY MEDICINE,49,5,388-393,WOS:000404274000010,,,#513,Fuglestad 2017,"",""

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE ENGINEERING STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS AND RETENTION,"Lourens, AS; Pannell, LS","The classification of engineering skills as scarce, in addition to imperatives to attract women to the field of engineering, allows universities the opportunity to develop interventions and programmes to attract, retain, and develop engineering students to become both successful students and successful, practising engineers. The research in this article focuses on the development of a new instrument, a questionnaire named the Self-Efficacy Instrument for Engineering Students (SEIES). It explores the self-efficacy, motivation, and confidence of engineering students at a university in a developing country, as a means to develop and retain them. SEIES was developed, based on nine sub-constructs, namely: maths self-efficacy, learning, problem-solving, coping, inclusion, organisational culture, and teamwork and role expectations. The data obtained from SEIES could also create a greater understanding of the academic motivational drivers and the confidence that engineering students display. It is anticipated that the application of such a research instrument in a longitudinal study would provide a variety of benefits to individual students, the academic faculty, higher education institutions, as well as the industry they serve. This understanding could improve student retention, growth, and development, address gender disparities, contribute to positive university experiences, and reduce the participation barriers for all engineering students.

This study tests whether Kanter's (Men and women of the corporation, Basic Books, New York, 1977) theory of proportions, which suggests that numerical representation of groups influence group dynamics and cultural context, applies to the proportion of female faculty and the probability that female doctoral students will complete their degrees in science and engineering. Using data from two research-intensive academic institutions, results show that female doctoral students are more likely to complete the degree in departments with higher proportions of female faculty. Further, female PhD students working with female faculty dissertation advisors are also more likely to complete the degree than female PhD students working with male faculty dissertation advisors. Departmental faculty sex ratios and whether their faculty advisor is male or female, however, have no effect on the completion probabilities of male PhD students.

Predictions of success in organic chemistry based on a mathematics skills test and academic achievement,"Lee, KS; Rix, B; Spivey, MZ","Organic Chemistry I presents challenges to many students pursuing diverse fields of study, oftentimes curtailing further progress in those fields. The ability to identify students at risk of unsuccessful course outcomes may lead to improved success rates by offering tailored resources to those students. Previously identified predictors include college entrance exam scores, grade point averages (GPA), General Chemistry II course grades, first exam scores, and results from a logical thinking assessment. This work explores the use of the 20-item Math-Up Skills Test (MUST) in a first-semester organic chemistry course over two years at a small private university. Analysis of scores on the MUST, which is taken during the first week of the semester, indicates a statistically significant difference between successful and unsuccessful first-time students (n = 74 and 49, respectively) as the MUST has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.861) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.29). Taken alone, the MUST predicts students at risk of not passing the course with 64% accuracy; addition of start-of-term science GPA data improves predictions to 82% accuracy. Predictions are further improved with incorporation of scores from the first exam of the semester.

Attracting and Retaining Women in Undergraduate Engineering Programs - A Case Study,"ASEE; Imran, A; Kalil, MNM; Hayati, FG","Gender disparities in engineering educational programs have been a cause of concern globally. Such disparities can lead to inequalities in professions with related social effects. In this case study, gender based analysis is performed on statistical data of students admitted to undergraduate programs in electrical and biomedical engineering during the academic years 2001-2010 at Ajman University of Science & Technology, United Arab Emirates. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the trends in admission, retention, and attrition. In each program significant changes were introduced from the academic year 2006-07. Therefore, differences observed before and after the changes were also analyzed.During the 10-year period (2001 - 2010), cumulative intake of women was 34%. The cumulative percentage of women students increased from 33% of the total intake in the first 5-years to 35% in the last 5-years. The overall retention over the 10-year period was 57%. The retention in the group of women was 65%. Introduction of changes in the programs enhanced student retention, more so in the group of women. Further, 73% of the cumulative attrition took place in the first three semesters after admission. Comparing the first and last 5-year periods, this attrition was 68% and 84%, respectively. This trend of attrition was strikingly similar in both the groups of women and men.The analysis suggests that the percentage of women has increased in recent years. Cumulative retention was higher in the group of women compared to that of men. Introduction of changes in the programs enhanced student retention in both groups.

Professors Prioritize Increasing Female Retention in Academic Physics Over Advisee's Interests,"Bailey, K; Horacek, D; Worthington, S; Schmitz, M","Decades of initiatives have striven to fix the so-called ""leaking pipeline"" problem-persistent high attrition of women from the career/educational path toward STEM professorship. Though these initiatives call on academics to increase female retention along this path, it remains unknown whether academics actually prioritize this goal. To investigate this, we tested whether academics would prioritize female retention at the cost of a competing goal when giving career advice to students at risk of leaving the ""pipeline."" We present results from a national survey in which United States professors (n = 364) responded to vignettes of three hypothetical undergraduates, rating the extent to which they would encourage or discourage each student from pursuing a PhD in physics. Professors were randomly assigned vignettes with either male or female gender pronouns. Two vignettes featured students who cogently explained why remaining in the physics pipeline would not match their individual goals and interests, while another vignette presented a student with goals and interests that clearly matched pursuing physics graduate school. Professors who received female-gendered vignettes were thus forced to choose between prioritizing striving to increase female retention in physics and acting in the best interest of the individual student. We present evidence that professors seem prepared to encourage women more strongly than men to remain in physics, even when remaining is contrary to the stated goals and interests of the student: Our logistic regression results suggest that professors have higher odds of encouraging women over men, net of vignette and other controls. We also find that male professors have higher odds of encouraging undergraduates and find no evidence that, relative to non-STEM professors, STEM professors have higher odds of encouraging women over men.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,6,,,WOS:000760692600001,10.3389/fsoc.2021.751703,,#529,Bailey 2022,"",""

In particular, we focused on college students' perception of productivity changes, benefits, challenges, and their overall preference for the future of online education. Our initial exploratory analysis showed that in most cases, students were not fully satisfied with the quality of the online education, and the majority of them suffered a plummet in their productivities. Despite the challenges, around 61% believed that they would prefer more frequent participation in online programs in the future (compared to the normal conditions before the pandemic). A structural equation model was developed to identify and assess the factors that contribute to their productivity and future preferences. The results showed that lack of sufficient communication with other students/ instructor as well as lack of required technology infrastructure significantly reduced students' productivity. On the other hand, productivity was positively affected by perceived benefits such as flexibility and better time management. In addition, productivity played a mediating role for a number of socio-economic, demographic, and attitudinal attributes: including gender, income, technology attitudes, and home environment conflicts. Accordingly, females, high income groups, and those with home environment conflicts experienced lower productivity, which indirectly discouraged their preference for future online education. As expected, a latent pro-online education attitude increased both the productivity and the future online-education preference.

Analyses were performed from 2015 to 2016.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinician trust was measured using a 5-item scale, including belonging, loyalty, safety focus, sense of trust, and responsibility to clinicians in need (range, 1-4, with 1 indicating lowand 4 indicating high; Cronbach alpha = 0.77). Other metrics included work control, work atmosphere (calm to chaotic), organizational culture (cohesiveness, emphases on quality and communication, and values alignment; range, 1-4, with 1 indicating low and 4 indicating high), and clinician stress (range, 1-5, with 1 indicating low and 5 indicating high), satisfaction (range, 1-5, with 1 indicating low and 4 indicating high), burnout (range, 1-5, with 1 indicating no burnout and 5 indicating very high feeling of burnout), and intention to leave (range, 1-5, with 1 indicating no intention to leave and 5 indicating definite intention to leave). Analyses included 2-level hierarchical modeling controlling for age, sex, specialty, and clinician type. Cohen d effect sizes (ESs) were considered small at 0.20, moderate at 0.50, and large at 0.80 or more.RESULTS The study included 165 clinicians (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [9.2] years; 86 [52.1%] women). Of these, 143 (87.7%) were physicians and 22 (13.3%) were advanced practice clinicians; 105 clinicians (63.6%) worked in family medicine, and 60 clinicians (36.4%) worked in internal medicine. Compared with clinicians with low levels of trust, clinicians who reported high levels of trust had higher mean (SD) scores for work control (2.49 [0.52] vs 2.18 [0.45]; P<.001), cohesiveness (3.11 [0.46] vs 2.51 [0.51]; P<.001), emphasis on quality vs productivity (3.12 [0.48] vs 2.58 [0.41]; P<.001), emphasis on communication (3.39 [0.41] vs 3.01 [0.44]; P<.001), and values alignment (2.61 [0.59] vs 2.12 [0.52]; P<.001). Men were more likely than women to express loyalty (ES, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.05-0.66; P=.02) and high trust (ES, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.01-0.62; P=.04).

"EXPLORING THE SELF-EFFICACY OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS: FINDINGS OF A LONGITUDINAL STUDY RELATING TO STUDENT RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT, RETENTION AND SUCCESS","Lourens, A","Engineering is regarded as a scarce and critical skill in South Africa, and the shortage of South African engineers represents a capacity and scare-skills crises for the country. A further problem facing the country is the shortage of woman engineers. Further to encouraging and supporting women entering the field of engineering, a South African university established the Women in Engineering Leadership Association (WELA) in 2011. In 2013, WELA embarked on a longitudinal study to establish the impact of the association on WELA members, and to determine the differences in self-efficacy between male and woman engineering students. The research instrument used for the purpose of the study was an adapted version of the Longitudinal Assessment of Engineering Self-Efficacy as developed by Marra and Bogue from the Assessing Women in Engineering (AWE) project. The findings presented in this article are the results of the first round of questionnaires, which highlighted findings relating to student recruitment, development, retention and success. The results of the first round of the study identified that co-curricular interventions were important to prepare students for the world of work, that international partnerships played a potentially powerful role in developing students, that role models were important especially to female engineering students and that technology was an important tool to recruit students. The aim of this article is to assist engineering faculties to understand possible gender differences and self-efficacy issues that could influence course selection, success, development and retention rates of male and woman engineering students. The study also envisions that other universities concerned with student development, success and retention would be able to duplicate some of the findings described.",2015,,JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES,13,1,36-53,WOS:000420044500003,,,#532,Lourens 2015,"",""
Gender Disparity Trends in Authorship of Hand Surgery Research,"Xu, RF; Varady, NH; Chen, AF; Earp, BE","Purpose Despite an overall trend towards gender parity, women continue to remain under-represented in surgical fields. Until recently, women's representation in hand surgery literature was largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to examine how authorship gender trends among academic hand surgeons have evolved between 2006 and 2019.Methods Original research articles published from 2006 to 2019 in 3 leading clinical hand surgery journals were extracted from PubMed. Publications with a full author first name were analyzed, and the gender of each author was assigned with the validated Genderize algorithm. Analyses were performed to evaluate authorship publication trends, unique authors, and research career productivity.Results From 2006 to 2019, 4,769 articles met the inclusion criteria, and the genders of 17,102 authors were identified. There were 2,848 (16.6%) female authors and 14,254 (83.4%) male authors. The proportion of female authors increased from 13.4% to 19.9% from 2006 to 2019. Similarly, female representation as first and senior authors increased significantly, from 10.9% to 20.1% and 7.6% to 14.2%, respectively. Of the 8,417 unique authors, 1,775 (21.1%) were women and 6,642 (78.9%) were men. Only 3.3% of these unique female authors published 5 or more papers during the study period. Among the 10 most frequently published authors for each gender, 18 of the 20 authors were surgeons.Conclusions There has been substantial progress toward gender parity in academic hand surgery over the last 14 years, and the proportion of women publishing in leadership positions has increased. Clinical relevance Increased gender representation in medicine and research is important for both patients and providers, and these findings suggest that ongoing support and mentorship for women in academic careers should be a priority.

Predictive Modeling of US Transportation Workforce Diversity Trends: A Study of Human Capital Recruitment and Retention in Complex Environments,"Kermanshachi, S; Sadatsafavi, H","Successful delivery of transportation projects requires extensive level of effort spent by departments of transportation skilled employees. Although these human resources are very valuable assets for transportation projects, most state agencies face numerous challenges in recruitment and retention of motivated and diverse employees. Earlier studies concluded that recent college graduates are less attracted to be hired by state agencies as the salary range would be less competitive compared to the same positions in private companies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate and assess the recruitment and retention trends of transportation workforce across different U.S. regions. For this reason, this research project utilized U.S. transportation workforce demographic information which has been nationally collected and published. The used database includes several demographical aspects of transportation workforce including: region, gender, age, disability status, ethnicity/race, years of experience, and supervisory role. In this study, the association of transportation workforce age with the transportation organization responsibilities across various regions were studied and analyzed. Furthermore, gender-based distribution of transportation workforce controlling for other variables was investigated and presented. It was concluded that the proportion of male to female employees in engineering positions is only associated with their race/ethnicity and year of service. It was also found that the gender disparity in engineering positions is higher in the White group than the African/American group controlling for region, year of service, disability status, and role (supervisory versus nonsupervisory). The outcome of this study helps transportation decision makers to incorporate appropriate policies into their human capital development strategic plans. The findings of this study will also enable state transportation agencies to diversify their active workforce through implementation of recruitment and retention practical approaches.",2018,,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRANSPORTATION AND DEVELOPMENT 2018: PLANNING, SUSTAINABILITY, AND INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS",,,105-114,WOS:000541124900011,,,#534,Kermanshachi 2018,"",""
Incentivized Spacing and Gender in Computer Science Education,"ASSOC COMP MACHINERY; YeckehZaare, I; Fox, E; Grot, G; Chen, SA; Walkosak, C; Kwon, K; Hofmann, A; Steir, J; McGeough, O; Silverstein, N","Extensive prior research shows that spacing - the distribution of studying over multiple sessions - significantly improves long-term learning in many disciplines. However, in computer science education, it is unclear if 1) spacing is effective in an incentivized, non-imposed setting and 2) when incentivized, female and male students space their studying differently. To investigate these research questions, we examined how students in an introductory computer science course (378 female and 310 male) spaced their studying. A retrieval practice tool in the course (for 5% of the course grade) incentivized students to space their studying, by awarding a point per day of usage. To measure how much each student spaced, we examined their interactions with the course eBook, which served as their primary learning resource. Specifically, when comparing two students with the same academic and demographic characteristics, the same measure of course easiness, and the same amount of content studied, we considered the student who distributed their studying over more days to be the one who spaced more. Using this definition, our structural equation modeling (SEM) results show that, 1) on average, students who spaced their studying over 14.516 more days (one standard deviation) got 2.25% higher final exam scores; and 2) female students spaced their studying over 4.331 more days than their male counterparts. These results suggest that, in an introductory computer science course, incentivized spacing is effective.

Provision of Onsite Childcare in US Academic Health Centers: What Factors Make a Difference?,"French, VA; Werner, JL; Feng, EJH; Latimer, RA; Wolff, SF; Wieneke, CL","Introduction: Challenges to work-life balance, including childcare, have been cited as major barriers to career advancement for women in academic medicine. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the availability of onsite childcare at academic health centers (AHCs) for US medical schools and examined institutional characteristics associated with its provision. Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) were used to identify US medical schools by region, type (private vs. public, community-based vs. not), financial relationship to the university, and numbers of female medical students, faculty, chairs, and deans. We assessed onsite childcare from publicly available information on institutional websites, plus phone calls to human resources departments at medical centers and/or medical schools. Results: Our study identified 144 US medical schools from the AAMC database and collected complete data for 136 (95%). Most AHCs offered onsite childcare (62%, 84/136). AHCs in the Midwest (78%) were most likely to have onsite childcare, whereas AHCs in the Southwest were least likely (14%, p < .001). No associations were demonstrated between onsite childcare and the proportion of female chairs or female faculty, or the AHC's financial relationship with the parent university. Conclusions: Although accessible childcare is critical to the upward mobility of women in medicine, more than a third of AHCs do not offer onsite childcare. As more women in medicine navigate childcare demands, the expansion of acces-sible, quality onsite childcare at AHCs is needed to promote a diverse academic workforce.

Role modeling is a viable retention strategy for undergraduate women in the geosciences,"Hernandez, PR; Bloodhart, B; Adams, AS; Barnes, RT; Burt, M; Clinton, SM; Du, WY; Godfrey, E; Henderson, H; Pollack, IB; Fischer, E","Gender diversity leads to better science; however, a number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, including many geoscience subdisciplines, show a persistent gender gap. PROmoting Geo-science Research, Education, and SuccesS (PROGRESS) is a theory-driven role modeling and mentoring program aimed at supporting undergraduate women interested in geoscience-related degree and career pathways. This study is unique because it is being conducted in a long-term applied setting, rather than as a laboratory exercise. We compare female STEM majors in PROGRESS to a matched control group (N = 380) using a longitudinal prospective multisite quasi-experimental design. College women in PROGRESS participated in a mentoring and role-modeling weekend workshop with followup support, while women in the control group participated in neither the workshop nor the follow-up support. PROGRESS members identified more female STEM career role models than controls (60% versus 42%, respectively), suggesting that deliberate interventions can develop the networks of undergraduate women. Undergraduate women that participate in PROGRESS have higher rates of persistence in geoscience-related majors (95% versus 73%), although the rates of switching into a geoscience-related major did not differ across groups. More strikingly, we also find that the persistence of undergraduate women in geoscience-related majors is related to the number of female STEM career role models they identify, as their odds of persisting approximately doubles for each role model they identify. We conclude that our ability to retain undergraduate women in the geosciences will depend, in part, on helping them to identify same-gender career role models. Further, the success of PROGRESS points to steps universities and departments can take to sustain their students' interest and persistence, such as hosting interactive panels with diverse female scientists to promote the attainability and social relevance of geoscience careers.",2018,,GEOSPHERE,14,6,2585-2593,WOS:000457106600014,10.1130/GES01659.1,,#537,Hernandez 2018,"",""
How Do Educational Experiences Predict Computing Identity?,"Lunn, S; Ross, M; Hazari, Z; Weiss, MA; Georgiopoulos, M; Christensen, K","Despite increasing demands for skilled workers within the technological domain, there is still a deficit in the number of graduates in computing fields (computer science, information technology, and computer engineering). Understanding the factors that contribute to students' motivation and persistence is critical to helping educators, administrators, and industry professionals better focus efforts to improve academic outcomes and job placement. This article examines how experiences contribute to a student's computing identity, which we define by their interest, recognition, sense of belonging, and competence/performance beliefs. In particular, we consider groups underrepresented in these disciplines, women and minoritized racial/ethnic groups (Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx). To delve into these relationships, a survey of more than 1,600 students in computing fields was conducted at three metropolitan public universities in Florida. Regression was used to elucidate which experiences predict computing identity and how social identification (i.e., as female, Black/African American, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) may interact with these experiences. Our results suggest that several types of experiences positively predict a student's computing identity, such as mentoring others, having a job, or having friends in computing. Moreover, certain experiences have a different effect on computing identity for female and Hispanic/Latinx students. More specifically, receiving academic advice from teaching assistants was more positive for female students, receiving advice from industry professionals was more negative for Hispanic/Latinx students, and receiving help on classwork from students in their class was more positive for Hispanic/Latinx students. Other experiences, while having the same effect on computing identity across students, were experienced at significantly different rates by females, Black/African American students, and Hispanic/Latinx students. The findings highlight experiential ways in which computing programs can foster computing identity development, particularly for underrepresented and marginalized groups in computing.",2022,,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION,22,2,,WOS:000771966100003,10.1145/3470653,,#538,Lunn 2022,"",""
Profile of female patients seeking in-patient treatment for prescription opioid abuse from a tertiary care drug dependence treatment centre from India,"Dayal, P; Balhara, YPS","Background & objectives: There has been a limited focus on prescription drug abuse among women in the country. Choice of psychoactive substance, reasons for initiation and co-occurring disorders have been found to be different among men and women. The current study was aimed at studying the profile of female patients seeking in-patient treatment for prescription drug use over a period of five years at a tertiary care drug dependence treatment centre in India.Methods: Case records of all female patients admitted with substance use disorder at a national level drug dependence treatment centre in north India across five years (between January 2008 and December 2012) were reviewed retrospectively to study their socio-demographic and clinical profile. The information was gathered using a semi-structured proforma and detailed case records. Abstinence, relapse and retention rates were calculated.Results: Over the five years, 31 female patients were admitted with prescription drug abuse. Of them, 12 (39%) used prescription opioids and 11 (36%) used prescription opioid along with benzodiazepines. Commonest prescription opioid was pentazocine used by 87 per cent of the women. Twenty two (71%) women were introduced to opioid by medical practitioners and commonest reason for introduction was pain (among 48%). Common co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses were depressive disorder (26%), cluster B traits/disorder (19%) and somatoform disorder (13%). Eight women did not complete treatment and left against medical advice. Thirteen women were advised maintenance treatment, and 70 per cent of them were retained for at least six months.Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings revealed a link between mental illness, pain and non-medical use of prescription opioids among women. Majority of these women received opioids as a legitimate prescription form physician. Therefore, these legitimate prescribers should be trained for pain management to facilitate proper treatment of pain and to prevent the subsequent misuse of these medicines.

Turnover among Australian general practitioners: a longitudinal gender analysis,"Bardoel, EA; Russell, G; Advocat, J; Mayson, S; Kay, M","Background Little is known about gender differences in general practitioner (GP) turnover. It is important to understand potential divergence given both the feminization of the Australian GP workforce and projected shortages of GPs. Objective There is increasing evidence that national health outcomes are related to the extent to which health care systems incorporate high quality primary care. Quality primary care is, in turn reliant on a stable general practice (GP) workforce. With the increasing feminization of medical schools, we sought to identify correlates of turnover in the GP workforce, separately for women and men, focusing particularly on part-time employment and child-rearing, and distinguishing effects related to either planned or unplanned turnover. Methods Annual responses from cohorts of at least 1900 women GPs and 2000 men GPs are used for up to eight waves of the Medicine in Australia-Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. Descriptive and bivariate correlations are provided. Random effects ordered logit is applied to dependent variables for turnover intentions measuring intent to ""leave direct care"" or ""leave medicine"". A behavioral measure of turnover is used in random effects logit regressions, with the exclusion or inclusion of the confounding intentions variables revealing correlates of unplanned or planned turnover. Results Part-time employment is associated with turnover intentions among both women (84% or 94% increase in the odds ratios or ORs) and particularly men (414% or 672%), and with actual turnover for women (150% or 49%) and for men (160% or 107%). Women GPs engage in more unplanned turnover than men: they are 85% more likely to engage in turnover after controlling for intentions. Unplanned turnover is concentrated among women below 40 years of age and with young children, even though both groups report below average turnover intentions. Conclusion Although further studies are needed to identify specific factors associated with GP turnover among women, the analysis highlights the need to focus on women GPs who are either young or have young children. Given the substantial personal and social investment required to produce GPs, it is wasteful to lose so many young women early in their careers.",2020,,HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH,18,1,,WOS:000597265800001,10.1186/s12960-020-00525-4,,#546,Bardoel 2020,"",""
University Students' Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Help for Psycho-Social Problems in Two Selected Public Universities in Tanzania: A Mixed Methods Study,"Daudi, E; Lyakurwa, SE; Amani, J","Universities worldwide have established psychological help services to help students deal with ever-growing psycho-social problems. However, evidence shows that students do not prefer using the available services. Nevertheless, the available evidence offers limited information about university students' attitudes toward seeking psychological help in Tanzania. Thus, the present study examined university students' attitudes toward seeking psychological help for psycho-social problems. Data were collected from 740 students using questionnaires and focus group discussions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze students' help-seeking attitudes. The independent sample t-test was used to determine the difference in students' attitudes by age, sex, and year of study. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means of attitudes by students' field of study. Thematic analysis technique guided the analysis of FGDs data. The findings revealed that most university students had positive attitudes toward seeking psychological help for the studied psycho-social problems. The FGDs findings revealed that students had positive attitudes mainly because they could get relief from the problems they faced, the presence of confidentiality to information shared, and the perceived competence of help service providers. Furthermore, the findings indicated a statistically significant difference in attitude scores for female students (M = 40.56, SD = 3.78) and male students (M = 39.64, SD = 4.62; t (723) = 2.9, p = 0.004, two-tailed). Moreover, university students' attitudes differed significantly by fields of study, F (3, 723) = 8.12, p < .001. Promoting positive help-seeking attitudes among students might improve their utilization of psychological help services.",2023,,SAGE OPEN,13,2,,WOS:001003786000001,10.1177/21582440231179200,,#547,Daudi 2023,"",""
Do Family Responsibilities and a Clinical Versus Research Faculty Position Affect Satisfaction with Career and Work-Life Balance for Medical School Faculty?,"Beckett, L; Nettiksimmons, J; Howell, LP; Villablanca, AC","Background: Balancing career and family obligations poses challenges to medical school faculty and contributes to dissatisfaction and attrition from academics. We examined the relationship between family setting and responsibilities, rank, and career and work-life satisfaction for faculty in a large U.S. medical school. Methods: Baseline faculty surveys were analyzed from the first year of a 4-year National Institutes of Health-funded study to evaluate awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and use of family friendly policies and career satisfaction. The study focus was on the impact of family responsibilities and characteristics of the faculty position (rank, clinical vs. nonclinical, and academic series) in multivariate comparisons between primary predictors and outcomes of interest. Results: Both clinical and family responsibilities for children under 18 play a major and interacting role in satisfaction with career and work-life balance. Clinical faculty respondents without children at home reported significantly greater career satisfaction and better work-life balance than their nonclinical counterparts. Nonclinical faculty respondents with children reported greater satisfaction and better balance than counterparts without family responsibilities. However, the advantage in career satisfaction and work-life balance for clinical faculty respondents disappeared for those with responsibility for young children. No gender-based differences were noted in the results or across faculty rank for respondents; however, for women, reaching associate professor resulted in greater career satisfaction. Conclusion: This study suggests that both work-related factors and family responsibilities influence satisfaction with career and work-life balance, but the predictors appear to interact in complex and nuanced ways. Further research is needed to delineate more clearly these interactions and to explore other factors that may play important additional roles.",2015,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,24,6,471-480,WOS:000363874300003,10.1089/jwh.2014.4858,,#548,Beckett 2015,"",""
Equity Efforts as Boundary Work: How Symbolic and Social Boundaries Shape Access and Inclusion in Graduate Education,"Posselt, J; Reyes, KA; Slay, KE; Kamimura, A; Porter, KB","Background/Context: Education scholars have examined how state policy and informal practice can widen or reproduce racial and gender inequalities in graduate education. Just one empirical study, which focused on psychology programs, has identified organizational practice that supports recruitment and retention of graduate students of color.Focus of Study: To identify organizational conditions and specific activities that support diversity in STEM graduate programs, the authors conducted a yearlong case study of a physics program that, for the last decade, has trained about 10% of the Black Ph.D.s in physics, nationally. They identified and described concrete efforts to enhance access and inclusion, and sought to understand how this program distinguished itself from a traditional physics department.Participants: Study participants consisted of 16 faculty, administrators, administrative staff, and students affiliated with the Applied Physics program at the University of Michigan.Research Design: Data for this qualitative case study was collected through eighteen interviews, two student focus groups, observations of everyday life and special events in the program, and a large amount of documentary data. Guided by the constant comparative method, the analysis assessed convergence and divergence across types of data and across faculty, administrator, staff, and student perspectives. Major findings represent four areas of consensus across participant roles.Findings/Results: Four themes explain how Applied Physics has increased access to and inclusion in a field known for its inequality. The program institutionalized a flexible, interdisciplinary intellectual paradigm; they reconceputalized their vision of the ideal student and reformed admissions accordingly; they empowered administrative staff to serve as cultural translators across racial and faculty-student boundaries; and they worked to create a family-like climate that gave them a competitive advantage over other physics programs.Conclusions/Recommendations: We interpret the findings from the perspective of Charles Tilly's boundary change mechanisms, and conclude that the common thread among the four themes was the program's willingness to erase, relocate, and/or deactivate boundaries that had implicitly created barriers to access and inclusion for underrepresented students. The paper recommends specific steps that graduate programs can take to analyze the symbolic boundaries operating in their own programs, and invites scholars to utilize the boundaries perspective in future research on educational inequality.",2017,,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,119,10,,WOS:000412873500007,,,#549,Posselt 2017,"",""
Frequent mastery testing with second-chance exams leads to enhanced student learning in undergraduate engineering,"Morphew, JW; Silva, M; Herman, G; West, M","Laboratory studies have routinely demonstrated that testing often leads to greater learning and retention than repeated studying. In the classroom, this effect has been replicated with memory and application tasks. However, studies of classrooms involving mathematical problem solving are sparse and have had mixed results. This paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental study in an undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics course that investigated more frequent testing that incorporated aspects of mastery testing and second-chance testing. Students in the frequent testing cohort scored seven percentage points higher and earned twice the number of As and half the number of failing grades. The advantage of frequent second-chance mastery testing was found for both multiple-choice and free-response questions and remained after controlling for differences in student ability.

Analysing drivers and outcomes of job and professional satisfaction at health centres in Portugal,"Santana, S; Loureiro, SMC","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse antecedents, associations and outcomes of job and professional satisfaction of doctors and nurses in Portuguese health centres. Design/methodology/approach The authors have used structural equation modelling to examine the causal relationships between multiple variables placed in a path model reflecting the theoretical foundation. Findings The percentage of those satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs was just above 50 per cent. Doctors' satisfaction stems from personal achievement and the formal component of work environment, leading them to strongly recommend their work in the health centre to dear ones but not to put aside other job options. Nurses' level of job satisfaction seems to be affected by co-workers and interpersonal relationships beside personal achievement and has more strong and multifaceted impact on their feelings and behaviour that goes from recommending their job position to considering to quit job and even regretting the option made in terms of career. Originality/value This study represents the first attempt to conceptualise and test a simultaneous model comprising antecedents and outcomes of both job satisfaction and professional satisfaction in primary care, investigating also differences between genders and professions.

To identify the risk factors for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) resident attrition. Study Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Annual Graduate Medical Education track survey. Methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of OHNS residents who matriculated between 2006 and 2015. Variables analyzed included age at matriculation, sex, race/ethnicity, medical degree type, program location, attrition status, and matriculation year period (2006-2010, 2011-2015). A logistic regression model was used to determine factors predictive of attrition, with a significance level set at P < .05. Results. A total of 3073 residents were analyzed. The overall attrition rate was 3.7%. Multivariable regression showed older residents (>= 30 years) had a 2.1 times higher risk of attrition compared to younger residents (<= 29 years) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.1; 95% confidence interval, CI [1.383-3.316], P < .001). Underrepresented minorities in medicine (URiM) residents had a 3.5 times higher risk of attrition compared to whites (aOR: 3.5; 95% CI [1.823-6.806], P < .001). Southern US programs had a 2.5 times higher risk of attrition compared to northeastern programs (aOR: 2.5; 95% CI [1.480-4.315], P < .001).

IOD treatment included placement of two endosseous implants in the mandibular canine region, followed by two abutments for resilient attachments. STI treatment included placement of endosseous implants, abutments, and cement-retained crowns. A modified Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-14 questionnaire was given at least 6 months following insertion of implant-supported prostheses for both groups. Patient age, gender, distribution of STI, and OHIP-14 data were gathered and analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to assess post-treatment data; Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences between groups older and younger than mean age and gender among the IOD and STI groups.Results: Fifty-one consecutive patients in the IOD (60.7% male, 39.2% female, mean age 63.7) and 50 consecutive patients in the STI group (58.0% female, 42.0% male, mean age 50.8) were included in this recall study.

Numerous large-scale programs have been developed to provide support and resources for women's enrichment and retention in academic medicine. Analyses of contributory factors to the aforementioned discrepancy commonly cite insufficient mentoring and role modeling as well as challenges with organizational navigation. Since residency training has been shown to be a critical juncture for making the decision to pursue an academic career, there is a need for innovative and tailored educational and mentorship programs targeting residents. Acknowledging residents' competing demands, we designed a program to provide easily accessible mentorship and contact with role models for our trainees at the departmental and institutional levels.

The Evolution of Educational Inequalities in Spain: Dynamic Evidence from Repeated Cross-Sections,"Choi, A; Gil, M; Mediavilla, M; Valbuena, J","A lack of longitudinal data prevents many countries from estimating dynamic models and, thus, from obtaining valuable evidence for policymaking in the field of education. This is the case of Spain, where recent education reforms have targeted secondary schools, but their design has been based on incomplete information regarding the evolution of student performance and far from robust evidence concerning just when educational inequalities are generated. This paper addresses the absence of longitudinal data required for performing such analyses by using a dynamic model with repeated cross-sectional data. We are able to link the reading competencies of students from the same cohort that participated in two international assessments at different ages (9/10 and 15/16) and so identify when educational gaps-in terms of gender, socio-economic status and place of birth-emerge.

The survey was formulated from best practices listed in the American Dental Education Association Faculty Diversity Toolkit. It consisted of 18 questions, including demographic information and faculty perceptions of their respective workplaces. These responses were then evaluated with descriptive statistics, Chi-squared analysis, Pearson Correlation, and Fleiss' kappa.ResultsThe survey's response rate was 19.2%. There was no significant difference in perceived retention strategies across race, age, gender, practice tenure, practice type, or clinical versus tenure track.

THE ROLE OF GENDER IN CAREER CHOICE AND INTENT TO WORK WITH IMMIGRANT AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES: IMPLICATIONS FOR EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM ENHANCEMENT,"Jacobs, R; Kane, M","Background. Fewer students are moving into primary care and the retention of primary care physicians in medically underserved communities is declining. Many medical students desire to be in esteemed specialties and do not perceive primary care to be a field that is well respected. Moreover, medical students may be influenced by the opinions of their colleagues, teachers, and role models. Also, the attitudes toward caring for immigrants and refugees may be influenced by gender role norms and expectations. However, few studies have addressed gender influences on intent to work with immigrants and patients in underserved and/or rural areas.Methods. We explored the association between gender and choice for future medical practice specialty, particularly with intent to care for uninsured, immigrant, refugee, and underserved populations. In addition, we sought to assess if future career choice was associated with intent to work with medically underserved communities. A cross-sectional, correlational design was used to collect data from medical students (N=239) in a large medical school in south Florida, United States. Students completed the ""Medical Student Attitudes toward the Underserved"" questionnaire. The questionnaire contained items on participants' personal characteristics, intentions to work with underserved, and future practice interests. Chi-square tests were performed using SPSS software.Results. The sample had 123 (51%) men and 116 (49%) women aged 20-47 years (M=24 years). About half were White (n=132; 55.2%); the rest were Asian/Pacific Islander (n =54; 22.5%), Black (n=17; 7.1%), and Hispanic (n=48; 24%). A relationship was found between gender and intentions to work with the underserved, x(2)(1, N=237) =12.07, p<.01, with higher intentions to work with the underserved associated with being female (59.2% vs. 40.8%). Additional chi-square tests indicated a relationship between gender and future medical specialty practice choices. Choice of pediatrics as a future medical specialty practice choice was associated with more intent to work with underserved (78.6% vs. 21.4%), x(2) (1, N=237) =21.1, p<.01. Surgical medicine as a future career choice was associated with less intent to work with underserved (74.2 vs. 25.8%), x(2) (1, N=237) =5.42, p<.01.Conclusion. Male students who have negative attitudes toward underserved populations may lack an understanding of these populations and the personal, cultural, and societal factors that affect health and health outcomes. Male students may have negative attitudes toward underserved populations due to social norms related to gender, insufficient role models, and the desire for more prestigious, high paying jobs. The gender of medical students might influence not only future career choice but in their future intentions to work in medically underserved, refugee and immigrant communities, where the need is great. Findings from this study could help guide academic programming efforts that encourage all students to pursue health careers in underserved areas where the need is great.",2018,,"12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)",,,7703-7708,WOS:000448704002107,,,#559,Jacobs 2018,"",""
"Programmatic engagement in diversity, equity, and inclusion in US vascular surgery training programs","Bose, S; Kowalczyk, B; Aulivola, B; Amankwah, K; Smeds, MR","Objective: Given the diversity of populations that modern healthcare professionals treat, there has been an increasing call for academic medical centers to ensure that they themselves are diverse and inclusive. Historically, this has been measured by the composition of the workforce in terms of protected categories such as race/ethnicity, gender, and disability. However, these broad categories have only poorly reflected the actual ability of organizations to engage with a diverse workforce and patient population. The diversity and engagement survey (DES) is a specifically constructed and validated instrument designed to measure the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within academic medical centers. The goal of the present study was to use the DES with vascular surgery program directors, to determine the predictors of low DEI in vascular surgery training programs.Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was sent to all program directors and assistant program directors of vascular surgery training programs (residencies and fellowships) in the United States (n = 280). The survey consisted of 18 sections with 53 questions regarding details of the respondent, demographics, programmatic information, including information on faculty and trainee diversity, the resources available to enhance DEI within the program, institutional attitudes toward employees, and the DES itself. The total score from the DES section was used to the stratify institutions, which were classified as low DEI if in the bottom 25% percentile of the overall scores or as high DEI if scoring higher. Univariate analysis was used to determine whether any important differences were present in the demographics or survey responses between the institutions scoring as low vs high DEI. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed using the demographic variables and responses to the survey questions to determine their relationship to DEI status.Results: There were a total of 102 complete responses to the survey (36.4% response rate). The proportion of women was higher (66.67%) than the men (33.30%) in the low DEI cohort, although women were only 28.4% of the overall cohort. A statistically significant difference was found between the high and low DEI institutions in the proportion of those who had responded yes, no, or preferred not to disclose whether they had experienced discrimination or hurtful comments (P < .001) with 71% of the respondents in the low DEI institutions reporting this experience compared with only 11% in high DEI institutions. Multivariate analysis also demonstrated that non-male gender (odds ratio, 5.10; P = .034) and ex-periences of discrimination (odds ratio, 6.51; P = .024) were associated with low DEI institutions.Conclusions: Non-male program directors and those who had experienced discrimination at their institution were significantly more likely to find that their institution had low DEI.

Following training, many begin their employment in medicine as early-career hospitalists, the majority being millennials. Objective To understand what elements influence millennial hospitalists' recruitment and retention. Design We developed a survey that asked participants to rate the level of importance of 18 elements (4-point Likert scale) in their decision to choose or remain at an HMG. Participants The survey was electronically distributed to hospitalists born in or after 1982 across 7 HMGs in the USA. Main Measures Elements were grouped into four major categories: culture of practice, work-life balance, financial considerations, and career advancement. We calculated the means for all 18 elements reported as important across the sample. We then calculated means by averaging elements within each category. We used unpaired t-tests to compare differences in means for categories for choosing vs. remaining at an HMG. Key Results One hundred forty-four of 235 hospitalists (61%) responded to the survey. 49.6% were females. Culture of practice category was the most frequently rated as important for choosing (mean 96%, SD 12%) and remaining (mean 96%, SD 13%) at an HMG. The category least frequently rated as important for both choosing (mean 69%, SD 35%) and remaining (mean 76%, SD 32%) at an HMG was career advancement. There were no significant differences between respondent gender, race, or parental status and ratings of elements for choosing or remaining with HMGs.

With little known regarding characteristics of physicians leaving the workforce, we sought to investigate the age and number of years since residency graduation at which male and female emergency physicians (EPs) exhibited workforce attrition.Methods: We performed a repeated cross-sectional analysis of EPs reimbursed by Medicare linked to date of birth and residency graduation date data from the American Board of Emergency Medicine for the years 2013-2020. Stratified by gender, our primary outcomes were the median age and number of years since residency graduation at the time of attrition, defined as the last year during the study time frame that an EP provided clinical services. We constructed a multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between gender and EP workforce attrition.Results: A total of 25,839 (70.2%) male and 10,954 (29.8%) female EPs were included. During the study years, 5905 male EPs exhibited attrition at a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 56.4 (44.5-65.4) years, and 2463 female EPs exhibited attrition at a median (IQR) age of 44.0 (38.0-53.9) years. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.82-2.91) was significantly associated with attrition from the workforce. Male and female EPs had respective median (IQR) post-residency graduation times in the workforce of 17.5 (9.5-25.5) years and 10.5 (5.5-18.5) years among those who exhibited attrition and one in 13 males and one in 10 females exited clinical practice within 5 years of residency graduation.Conclusions: Female physicians exhibited attrition from the EM workforce at an age approximately 12 years younger than male physicians.

Rank Equity Index: Measuring Parity in the Advancement of Underrepresented Populations in Academic Medicine,"Fassiotto, M; Flores, B; Victor, R; Altamirano, J; Garcia, LC; Kotadia, S; Maldonado, Y","As educators, researchers, clinicians, and administrators, faculty serve pivotal roles in academic medical centers (AMCs). Thus, the quality of faculty members' experiences is inseparable from an AMC's success. In seeking new methods to assess equity in advancement in academic medicine, the authors developed the Rank Equity Index (REI)-adapted from the Executive Parity Index, a scale previously implemented within the business sector-to examine national data on gender and racial/ethnic equity across faculty ranks. The REI was employed on self-reported demographic data, collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges, from U.S. medical school faculty in 2017, to make pairwise rank comparisons of the professoriate by demographic characteristics and department. Overall results indicated that women did not attain parity at any pairwise rank comparison, while men were above parity at all ranks. Similar results were observed across all departments surveyed: women in the basic sciences had REIs closest to parity, women in pediatrics had the highest representation but had REIs that were further from parity than REIs in the basic sciences, and women in surgery demonstrated the lowest REIs. Nationally, REIs were below 1.00 for all racial/ethnic group rank comparisons except for White and, in one case, multiple-race non-Hispanic/Latinx. Across all analyzed departments, Black/African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and multiple-race Hispanic/Latinx faculty had REIs below parity at all ranks except in 2 cases. In a comparison of 2017 and 2007 data, REIs across both race/ethnicity and gender were lower in 2007 for nearly all groups. REI analyses can highlight inequities in faculty rank that may be masked when using aggregate faculty proportions, which do not account for rank. The REI provides AMCs with a new tool to better analyze institutional data to inform efforts to increase parity across all faculty ranks.",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,12,1844-1852,WOS:000592283100028,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003720,,#566,Fassiotto 2020,"",""
Limitations in Faculty Advancement for Underrepresented Groups in Academic Otolaryngology,"Kim, SG; Russel, SM; Stack, TJ; Frank-Ito, DO; Farzal, Z; Ebert, CS ; Buckmire, RA; Demason, CE; Shah, RN","Objective: Despite the increasing racial diversity of the United States, representation in academic medicine faculty does not reach concordance with the general population and worsens with higher rank. Few studies have examined this within academic Otolaryngology and surgical subspecialties. This project aims to compare rank equity in academic Otolaryngology on self-reported gender and race/ethnicity between the years 2000 and 2020.Methods: Publicly available data were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges under the ""Data & Reports"" section for the years 2000 and 2020. The report comprised of full-time faculty from all U.S. medical schools. To determine parity between faculty ranks across gender and race/ethnicity, rank equity index (REI) was calculated for associate/assistant, professor/associate, and professor/assistant professor comparisons.Results: The percentage of women faculty in Otolaryngology has increased from 21% in 2000 to 37% in 2020; however, they did not achieve parity at all rank comparisons for both years. On the contrary, men were above parity at all rank comparisons. Improvements in rank equity occurred for Black/African American (Black) and Hispanic Latino/Spanish Origin (Latine) faculty between the years 2000 and 2020; however, when accounting for gender, benefits were concentrated among men.Conclusion: Advancement along the academic ladder is limited for women of all racial groups in academic Otolaryngology. While improved rank equity was seen for Black and Latine faculty, these improvements were largely among men. Future directions should aim to identify barriers to recruitment, retention, and promotion for women and underrepresented in medicine (URiM) academic otolaryngologists and create interventions that diversify Otolaryngology faculty at all ranks.Level of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 2023",2024,,LARYNGOSCOPE,134,4,1625-1632,WOS:001096325300001,10.1002/lary.31110,,#567,Kim 2024,"",""
The evaluation of students? progression in lower secondary education in Brazil: Exploring the path for equity,"Ferrao, ME","Improving the access to and quality of compulsory education among children is one of the most promising measures to tackle poverty in the medium-long run. This study examines the individual sociodemographic and educational attributes related to the probability of students' progression through lower secondary public edu-cation in Brazil. Based on the longitudinal design track of a cohort of Brazilian 5th grade public-school students, multilevel logistic regression models are applied to merged databases of the Educational Census and Prova Brasil, which have a national coverage. The response variable is whether the pupil was steadily promoted from the 5th to 9th grade, or not. The predicting variables include students' prior achievement in reading and mathematics, early experience of grade repetition, preschool attendance, and several sociodemographic attributes such as gender, self-declared race/skin color, socioeconomic status, and proxies of being exposed to extreme poverty. A distinctive aspect of this study is the use of big identifiable data collected by the institute in charge of Brazilian educational evaluation. Our findings show that lower secondary education completion in due time is strongly associated with prior achievement, and that the main effect of students' socioeconomic status is modest, having a moderator effect with maths. Estimates obtained also give emphasis to the cumulative effect of early grade repetition, preschool attendance, and extreme poverty exposure. Gender and race/ethnicity gaps are shown. Moreover, the students' progression varies randomly across schools, municipalities, and states; this provides an opportunity for compelling insights into school and higher levels of public policy design, implementation, and evaluation. Results highlight the role of preschool and primary education in the path for equity.

This study evaluated the impact of a faculty development program called the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP) on participants' (1) self-ratings of efficacy, (2) promotion in academic rank, and (3) institutional retention. Method Participants from the 2013-2020 LAMP cohorts were surveyed pre and post program to assess their level of agreement with statements that spanned domains of self-awareness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with work and work environment. Pre and post responses were compared using McNemar's tests. Changes in scores across gender were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Mann-Whitney tests. LAMP participants were matched to nonparticipant controls by gender, rank, department, and time of hire to compare promotions in academic rank and departures from the organization. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine differences. Results There were significant improvements in almost all self-ratings on program surveys (p < 0.05). Greatest improvements were seen in ""understand the promotions process"" (36% vs. 94%), ""comfortable negotiating"" (35% vs. 74%), and ""time management"" (55% vs. 92%). There were no statistically significant differences in improvements by gender, however women faculty rated themselves lower on all pre-program items compared to men. There was significant difference found in time-to-next promotion (p = 0.003) between LAMP participants and controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that LAMP faculty achieved next promotion more often and faster than controls. Cox-proportional-hazards analyses found that LAMP faculty were 61% more likely to be promoted than controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.23, p-value = 0.004). There was significant difference found in time-to-departure (p < 0.0001) with LAMP faculty retained more often and for longer periods. LAMP faculty were 77% less likely to leave compared to controls (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16-0.34, p < 0.0001).

The most recent and relevant 39 articles were selected for meta-thematic synthesis using detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria.Data extraction The articles were purposively sampled to cover protected characteristics and career stages and coded for factors related to equitable participation. 17 articles were fully coded. No new themes arose after nine papers. Themes and higher level categories were derived through an iterative consensual process.Results 13 discrete themes of factors impacting on equitable participation were identified including societal attitudes and expectations; national and organisational policies, priorities and resourcing; academic and clinical workplace cultures; supportive, discriminatory and compensatory interpersonal behaviours and personal factors related to social capital, finances, competing priorities, confidence and ambition, and orientation to clinical, academic and leadership roles.Conclusions The broad and often interconnected nature of these factors suggests that interventions will need to address structural and cultural factors as well as individual needs. In addition to standard good practice on equality and diversity, we suggest that organisations provide equitable support towards early publication success and targeted mentoring; address financial and role insecurity; address the clinical workplace culture; mitigate clinical-academic-personal role conflicts and overload; ensure that promotional structures and processes encourage diverse applicants and promote family-friendly, coherent and transparent national career pathways.",2020,,BMJ OPEN,10,3,,WOS:000527801000088,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033480,,#570,Vassie 2020,"",""
Relative remoteness and wage differentials in the Canadian allied health I professional workforce br,"Gupta, N; Gulliver, A; Singh, P","Introduction: Health workforces around the world are characterized with geographic maldistribution, often leading to inequalities in rural health outcomes. Monetary incentives are frequently raised as a policy option to bolster recruitment of healthcare practitioners to rural and underserved communities; however, few rural health workforce studies focus on allied health professionals (AHPs), include urban comparators, integrate gender considerations, or measure rural diversity. This population-based observational study examines trends in the geographic and gender distribution and earnings of AHPs in Canada across the rural-urban continuum.Methods: Nationally representative data from the 2006 and 2016 Canadian population censuses were pooled and linked with the geocoded Index of Remoteness for all inhabited communities. Five groups of university-educated AHPs providing prevention, diagnostic evaluation, therapy, and rehabilitation services were identified by occupation. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between relative remoteness and annual earnings of AHPs aged 25-54 years, controlling for gender and other personal and professional characteristics.Results: The density of AHPs was found to be 15 times higher in more urbanized and accessible parts of the country (23.6-25.6 per 10 000 population in 2016) compared to the most rural and remote areas (1.6 per 10 000 population), a pattern that changed little over the previous decade. A positive correlation was seen across occupations in terms of the degree of feminization and their geographic dispersion by relative remoteness. While pharmacists residing in more rural and remote communities earned 9% (95% confidence interval 4-15%) more than those in core urban centers, relative remoteness contributed little to wage differentials among dentists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, or other AHPs in therapy and assessment (no significant difference at p<0.05). Women earned significantly less than men in dentistry, pharmacy, and physical or occupational therapy, after adjusting for remoteness and other characteristics.Conclusion: This study did not find consistent wage disparities by relative remoteness as characterizing allied health professions in Canada. The evidence base to support financial incentives to AHPs to reduce perceived opportunity costs associated with working and living in rural and underserved areas remains limited. More research is needed on the intersections of rurality, gender, and wage differentials among AHPs in different national contexts.",2023,,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,23,2,,WOS:001011431500002,10.22605/RRH7882,,#571,Gupta 2023,"",""
Application of machine learning model to predict osteoporosis based on abdominal computed tomography images of the psoas muscle: a retrospective study,"Huang, CB; Hu, JS; Tan, K; Zhang, W; Xu, TH; Yang, L","Background With rapid economic development, the world's average life expectancy is increasing, leading to the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis worldwide. However, due to the complexity and high cost of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examination, DXA has not been widely used to diagnose osteoporosis. In addition, studies have shown that the psoas index measured at the third lumbar spine (L3) level is closely related to bone mineral density (BMD) and has an excellent predictive effect on osteoporosis. Therefore, this study developed a variety of machine learning (ML) models based on psoas muscle tissue at the L3 level of unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) to predict osteoporosis. Methods Medical professionals collected the CT images and the clinical characteristics data of patients over 40 years old who underwent DXA and abdominal CT examination in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University database from January 2017 to January 2021. Using 3D Slicer software based on horizontal CT images of the L3, the specialist delineated three layers of the region of interest (ROI) along the bilateral psoas muscle edges. The PyRadiomics package in Python was used to extract the features of ROI. Then Mann-Whitney U test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to reduce the dimension of the extracted features. Finally, six machine learning models, Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Gradient boosting machine (GBM), and Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied to train and validate these features to predict osteoporosis. Results A total of 172 participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. 82 participants were enrolled in the osteoporosis group, and 90 were in the non-osteoporosis group. Moreover, the two groups had no significant differences in age, BMI, sex, smoking, drinking, hypertension, and diabetes. Besides, 826 radiomic features were obtained from unenhanced abdominal CT images of osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic patients. Five hundred fifty radiomic features were screened out of 826 by the Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, 16 significant radiomic features were obtained by the LASSO algorithm. These 16 radiomic features were incorporated into six traditional machine learning models (GBM, GNB, LR, RF, SVM, and XGB). All six machine learning models could predict osteoporosis well in the validation set, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values greater than or equal to 0.8. GBM is more effective in predicting osteoporosis, whose AUROC was 0.86, sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.92, and accuracy 0.81 in validation sets. Conclusion We developed six machine learning models to predict osteoporosis based on psoas muscle images of abdominal CT, and the GBM model had the best predictive performance. GBM model can better help clinicians to diagnose osteoporosis and provide timely anti-osteoporosis treatment for patients. In the future, the research team will strive to include participants from multiple institutions to conduct external validation of the ML model of this study.",2022,,BMC GERIATRICS,22,1,,WOS:000867661900001,10.1186/s12877-022-03502-9,,#572,Huang 2022,"",""

For each of the two groups of workers, factors related to the employees being kept by their company one month after being declared unfit for the job were studied by logistic regression.Results. - Only 6.9% of the 5352 workers declared unfit for the job due to MSD were kept in their company whereas 3.6% of the 3155 workers declared unfit for the job due to MHD were kept in theirs. For the two groups of workers, the proportion of employees kept by their company decreased with female gender (OR = 0.63 95%Cl [0.47-0.84] for MSD and OR = 0.50 [0.32-0.78] for MHD for female vs. male), long sickleave (OR = 0.26 [0.18-0.40] for MSD and OR = 0.22 [0.11-0.45] for MHD for sick-leave > 6 months vs. no sick leave), small size of the company (< 50 employees) and working in the construction field or services sector (vs. industry or administration). Concerning the employees declared unfit due to MSD alone, the proportion of employees kept by their company decreased for seniors (> 50 years old) and for those with low seniority (< 5 years).Conclusion. - ""Retention in a company"" as a tool for ""maintenance of employment"" is a little-discussed subject, lending further credence to the current recommendations for reduction of inequalities in working conditions and vocational training of employees according to age and socio-occupational category, and also for reduction of inequalities in occupational pathways according to gender.

Turnover of compulsory school principals in Iceland from 1998 to 2020,"Hansen, B; Björnsdóttir, A","Turnover of principals is an issue of concern in many countries, including Iceland (Borkur Hansen, 2021). To a large extent, interest in turnover is based on research findings that show the importance of retaining school principals for sustaining good practices and student learning (Beteille et al., 2011; Hargreaves & Fink, 2006; Seashore-Louis et al., 2010). However, turnover of school principals is not extensively researched, with the main accessible studies coming from the US and some from Sweden (Rangel, 2018; Thelin, 2020). According to Rangel (2018), the main concepts used in these studies are ""stayers"", ""movers"", ""mobility"" and ""stability"". Sigurbjorg Robertsdottir et al. (2019) state that the role of compulsory school principals in Iceland is rapidly changing, primarily due to the addition of new tasks to their roles and increased pressure for academic achievement. They claim that this development has led to decreased job satisfaction, increased stress, and fewer applications for vacant positions of compulsory school principals. Kaplan & Owings (2015) paint a similar picture of the situation in the US, where demands on principals have become unrealistic, resulting in high turnover and fewer people applying for the job. Pritchard (2019) reports that 25% of school principals in the US quit their job every year, and around 50% of new principals quit after three years.Seashore-Louis et al. (2010) argue that poorly planned exchanges of principals can have a negative impact on student learning. They highlight that successful work may be disrupted when new people take over and the replacement has been inadequately planned. The findings of the International Successful School Principalship Project (ISSPP) point in the same direction (Moos et al., 2011). Hargreaves & Fink (2006) agree and focus on the importance of ensuring that the leadership of principals does not weaken or disappear when a new person is hired. Lee (2015) further emphasizes that succession planning for principals should not be left to chance.Considering the above, a study was conducted to explore the retention of principals in all compulsory schools in Iceland during a 23-year period. Data obtained from Statistics Iceland was available for the period 1998 to 2020. The study focused on investigating the extent to which principals transferred between schools, as well as differences based on gender, school size and geographical area. The study also examined the duration of the principals' stay in each school and the total time they spent as principals in compulsory schools. The study looked for a pattern in their transfers, for example, whether they transferred to larger schools from smaller schools or from rural to more urban areas.The main finding of this study is that there was considerable stability amongst compul-sory school principals in Iceland from 1998 to 2020. The majority, 78%, stayed in the same school for an extended period, 5.01 years on average, but over one-fourth of them stayed for only one year. If those principals are excluded, the average is 6.47 years. About one-fifth of the group, or 22%, had moved between schools, where 17% had worked as princi-pals in two schools and 5% in more than two schools. On average, principals had worked in 1.28 schools for 6.2 years. Men tended to stay slightly longer in the same school than women. Stability amongst principals was considerably greater in large schools than in smaller schools, resulting in less stability in rural areas where most of the smaller schools are located.The mobility between schools was primarily between schools in the same geographical area.The findings indicate that the turnover rate of principals in Iceland is considerably lower than in the US where a large percentage leaves during the first years on the job (Pritchard, 2019). The situation in Iceland, on the other hand, resembles that of Sweden. Thelin (2020) says that her study on the turnover of school principals between munici-palities in Sweden from 1980 to 2017 reveals an average tenure of about seven years in each municipality, with infrequent transfers between schools. Additionally, Thelin notes that principals in rural areas changed schools more frequently compared to metropolitan and urban areas.",2023,,TIMARIT UM UPPELDI OG MENNTUN-ICELANDIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,32,1-2,37-60,WOS:001145885100005,10.24270/tuuom.2023.32.3,,#574,Hansen 2023,"",""
How to identify sex chromosomes and their turnover.,Palmer DH; Rogers TF; Dean R; Wright AE,"Although sex is a fundamental component of eukaryotic reproduction, the genetic systems that control sex determination are highly variable. In many organisms the presence of sex chromosomes is associated with female or male development. Although certain groups possess stable and conserved sex chromosomes, others exhibit rapid sex chromosome evolution, including transitions between male and female heterogamety, and turnover in the chromosome pair recruited to determine sex. These turnover events have important consequences for multiple facets of evolution, as sex chromosomes are predicted to play a central role in adaptation, sexual dimorphism, and speciation. However, our understanding of the processes driving the formation and turnover of sex chromosome systems is limited, in part because we lack a complete understanding of interspecific variation in the mechanisms by which sex is determined. New bioinformatic methods are making it possible to identify and characterize sex chromosomes in a diverse array of non-model species, rapidly filling in the numerous gaps in our knowledge of sex chromosome systems across the tree of life. In turn, this growing data set is facilitating and fueling efforts to address many of the unanswered questions in sex chromosome evolution. Here, we synthesize the available bioinformatic approaches to produce a guide for characterizing sex chromosome system and identity simultaneously across clades of organisms. Furthermore, we survey our current understanding of the processes driving sex chromosome turnover, and highlight important avenues for future research.",2019,Nov,Mol Ecol,28,21,4709-4724,,10.1111/mec.15245,31538682,#581,Palmer 2019,"",""

Breast-feeding and postpartum weight retention: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,He X; Zhu M; Hu C; Tao X; Li Y; Wang Q; Liu Y,"OBJECTIVE: Weight gained during pregnancy and postpartum weight retention might contribute to obesity in women of childbearing age. Whether breast-feeding (BF) may decrease postpartum weight retention (PPWR) is still controversial. The purpose of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between BF and PPWR. DESIGN: Three databases were systematically reviewed and the reference lists of relevant articles were checked. Meta-analysis was performed to quantify the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) of BF on PPWR by using a random-effect model. Heterogeneity was tested using the χ 2 test and I 2 statistics. Publication bias was estimated from Egger's test (linear regression method) or Begg's test (rank correlation method). RESULTS: Among 349 search hits, eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Seven studies were conducted in the USA, one in Brazil, one in France, one in Georgia and one in Croatia. Compared with formula-feeding, BF for 3 to ≤6 months seemed to have a negative influence on PPWR and if BF continued for >6 months had little or no influence on PPWR. In a subgroup meta-analysis, the results did not change substantially after the analysis had been classified by available confounding factors. There was no indication of a publication bias from the result of either Egger's test or Begg's test.

Professors Prioritize Increasing Female Retention in Academic Physics Over Advisee's Interests.,Bailey K; Horacek D; Worthington S; Schmitz M,"Decades of initiatives have striven to fix the so-called ""leaking pipeline"" problem-persistent high attrition of women from the career/educational path toward STEM professorship. Though these initiatives call on academics to increase female retention along this path, it remains unknown whether academics actually prioritize this goal. To investigate this, we tested whether academics would prioritize female retention at the cost of a competing goal when giving career advice to students at risk of leaving the ""pipeline."" We present results from a national survey in which United States professors (n = 364) responded to vignettes of three hypothetical undergraduates, rating the extent to which they would encourage or discourage each student from pursuing a PhD in physics. Professors were randomly assigned vignettes with either male or female gender pronouns. Two vignettes featured students who cogently explained why remaining in the physics pipeline would not match their individual goals and interests, while another vignette presented a student with goals and interests that clearly matched pursuing physics graduate school. Professors who received female-gendered vignettes were thus forced to choose between prioritizing striving to increase female retention in physics and acting in the best interest of the individual student.

Dataset: Knowledge and attitude retention following an implicit bias classroom workshop.,Zhou Y; Purkiss J; Juneja M; Greely J; Beasley A; Gill A,"Background: Baylor College of Medicine provides a classroom-based implicit bias workshop to all third-year medical students to increase students' awareness of their unconscious bias and develop strategies for reducing health care disparities. The workshop meets our immediate goals and objectives. However, we are unsure if the benefit would be long-term or diminish over time. Methods: To examine the concept retention from the implicit bias classroom workshop, we administered a self-developed seven-item seven-point Likert-scale survey to our medical students at pre-, post-, and one-year post-workshop attendance. Results: The data set was comprised of survey results from two cohorts of our third and fourth-year medical students from 2018 to 2020 and included 289 completed records at three measurement points. The data included: Student Identifiers, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Student Enrollment Type, Cohort, and three repeated measures results for each of the seven items, which were documented in wide format.

Sex-biased gene content is associated with sex chromosome turnover in Danaini butterflies.,Mora P; Hospodářská M; Voleníková AC; Koutecký P; Štundlová J; Dalíková M; Walters JR; Nguyen P,"Sex chromosomes play an outsized role in adaptation and speciation, and thus deserve particular attention in evolutionary genomics. In particular, fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes can produce neo-sex chromosomes, which offer important insights into the evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origin of the previously reported Danaus neo-sex chromosome within the tribe Danaini. We assembled and annotated genomes of Tirumala septentrionis (subtribe Danaina), Ideopsis similis (Amaurina), Idea leuconoe (Euploeina) and Lycorea halia (Itunina) and identified their Z-linked scaffolds. We found that the Danaus neo-sex chromosome resulting from the fusion between a Z chromosome and an autosome corresponding to the Melitaea cinxia chromosome (McChr) 21 arose in a common ancestor of Danaina, Amaurina and Euploina. We also identified two additional fusions as the W chromosome further fused with the synteny block McChr31 in I. similis and independent fusion occurred between ancestral Z chromosome and McChr12 in L. halia. We further tested a possible role of sexually antagonistic selection in sex chromosome turnover by analysing the genomic distribution of sex-biased genes in I. leuconoe and L. halia. The autosomes corresponding to McChr21 and McChr31 involved in the fusions are significantly enriched in female- and male-biased genes, respectively, which could have hypothetically facilitated fixation of the neo-sex chromosomes. This suggests a role of sexual antagonism in sex chromosome turnover in Lepidoptera. The neo-Z chromosomes of both I. leuconoe and L. halia appear fully compensated in somatic tissues, but the extent of dosage compensation for the ancestral Z varies across tissues and species.",2024,Dec,Mol Ecol,33,24,e17256,,10.1111/mec.17256,38180347,#592,Mora 2024,"",""

Gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention in Tasmanian women: The Baby-bod Study.,Jayasinghe S; Herath MP; Beckett JM; Ahuja KDK; Street SJ; Byrne NM; Hills AP,"Many factors can negatively impact perinatal outcomes, including inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG). Despite having the greatest potential to influence maternal and infant health, there is a lack of consensus regarding the GWG consistent with a healthy pregnancy. To date, GWG in Northern Tasmania remains understudied. We investigated how maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is related to weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention post-partum, and how maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is related to the mode of delivery. Approximately 300 Tasmanian mothers (n = 291 for mode of delivery and n = 282 for GWG) were included in this study. Analysis of variance and chi square tests were conducted to assess differences in BW of mothers across BMI categories and differences between categorical variables; respectively. Based on pre-pregnancy BMI, mothers were assigned to one of three groups, with healthy weight (<25 kg m-2), with overweight (25-29.9 kg m-2), or with obesity (>30 kg m-2). Pre-pregnancy BMI and body weight (BW) were significantly associated (p<0.001) with post-partum BW at 3 and 6 months. Only 25% of mothers with a normal weight BMI, 34% with overweight and 13% with obesity, achieved the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendation for GWG. Interestingly, a number of women in our cohort lost weight during gestation (1.5, 9 and 37% in <25, 25-29.9 and >30 kg m-2 groups, respectively). Further, women with obesity showed the lowest level of BW fluctuation and retained less weight post-partum. The highest number of caesarean sections were observed in mothers who exceeded GWG recommendations. Most mothers either exceeded or failed to achieve IOM recommendations for GWG. To improve the generalisability of these findings, this study should be replicated in a larger representative sample of the Tasmanian maternal population.",2022,,PLoS One,17,3,e0264744,,10.1371/journal.pone.0264744,35316273,#596,Jayasinghe 2022,"",""

OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in rates of leaving academia between male and female physicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used Care Compare data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for all physicians who billed Medicare from teaching hospitals from March 2014 to December 2019, excluding physicians who retired during the study period. Data were analyzed from November 11, 2021, to May 24, 2022. EXPOSURE: Physician gender. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was leaving academia, which was defined as not billing Medicare from a teaching hospital for more than 1 year. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for physician characteristics and region of the country. RESULTS: There were 294 963 physicians analyzed (69.5% male). The overall attrition rate from academia was 34.2% after 5 years (38.3% for female physicians and 32.4% for male physicians). Female physicians had higher attrition rates than their male counterparts across every career stage (time since medical school graduation: <15 years, 40.5% vs 34.8%; 15-29 years, 36.4% vs 30.3%; ≥30 years, 38.5% vs 33.3%).

We aimed to further investigate whether the adipogenic properties where cell-intrinsic, or dependent on a depot-specific or obesity-produced microenvironment. We obtained visceral and subcutaneous biopsies from non-obese women (n = 14) or women living with morbid obesity (n = 14) and isolated adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) from the stromal vascular fraction of non-obese (n = 13) and obese (n = 13). Following in vitro differentiation into mature adipocytes, we observed a contrasting pattern with a lower gene expression of adipogenic markers and a higher gene expression of immunogenic markers in the visceral compared to the subcutaneous adipocytes. We identified the immunogenic factor BST2 as a marker for visceral ASPCs. The effect of obesity and insulin resistance on adipogenic and immunogenic markers in the in vitro differentiated cells was minor. In contrast, differentiation with exogenous Tumor necrosis factor resulted in increased immunogenic signatures, including increased expression of BST2, and decreased adipogenic signatures in cells from both depots. Our data, from 26 women, underscore the intrinsic differences between human visceral and subcutaneous adipose stem and progenitor cells, suggest that dysregulation of adipocytes in obesity mainly occurs at a post-progenitor stage, and highlight an inflammatory microenvironment as a major constraint of human adipogenesis.",2022,,Front Cell Dev Biol,10,,983899,,10.3389/fcell.2022.983899,36340033,#598,Mathur 2022,"",""

Derailed protein turnover in the aging mammalian brain.,Rao NR; Upadhyay A; Savas JN,"Efficient protein turnover is essential for cellular homeostasis and organ function. Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging culminating in severe dysfunction of protein turnover. To investigate protein turnover dynamics as a function of age, we performed continuous in vivo metabolic stable isotope labeling in mice along the aging continuum. First, we discovered that the brain proteome uniquely undergoes dynamic turnover fluctuations during aging compared to heart and liver tissue. Second, trends in protein turnover in the brain proteome during aging showed sex-specific differences that were tightly tied to cellular compartments. Next, parallel analyses of the insoluble proteome revealed that several cellular compartments experience hampered turnover, in part due to misfolding. Finally, we found that age-associated fluctuations in proteasome activity were associated with the turnover of core proteolytic subunits, which was recapitulated by pharmacological suppression of proteasome activity. Taken together, our study provides a proteome-wide atlas of protein turnover across the aging continuum and reveals a link between the turnover of individual proteasome subunits and the age-associated decline in proteasome activity.",2024,Feb,Mol Syst Biol,20,2,120-139,,10.1038/s44320-023-00009-2,38182797,#600,Rao 2024,"",""

Improving postpartum retention in care for women living with HIV in the United States.,Momplaisir FM; Storm DS; Nkwihoreze H; Jayeola O; Jemmott JB,": Research findings have consistently demonstrated that women living with HIV in the United States and globally experience declines in medication adherence and retention in care after giving birth. A number of studies have identified factors associated with postpartum retention in care, but the evidence base for interventions to address the problem and close this gap in the HIV care continuum is limited. Furthermore, the majority of studies have been conducted in low-resource or moderate-resource countries and may be less applicable or require adaptation for use in high resource countries. In the United States, up to two-thirds of women drop out of care after delivery and are unable to maintain or achieve viral suppression postpartum, at a time when maternal and pediatric health are closely linked. We conducted a critical review of the literature to identify existing gaps regarding maternal retention in the United States and conceptualize the problem through the lens of the integrated and ecological models of health behavior. This review describes existing barriers and facilitators to retention in HIV care postpartum from published studies and suggests steps that can be taken, using a multilevel approach, to improve maternal retention.

Influence of CUREs on STEM retention depends on demographic identities.,Bradshaw L; Vernon J; Schmidt T; James T; Zhang J; Archbold H; Cadigan K; Wolfe JP; Goldberg D,"Research has shown that undergraduate research experiences can have substantive effects on retaining students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). However, it is impossible to provide individual research experiences for every undergraduate student, especially at large universities. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have become a common approach to introduce large numbers of students to research. We investigated whether a one-semester CURE that replaced a traditional introductory biology laboratory course could increase retention in STEM as well as intention to remain in STEM, if the results differed according to demography, and investigated the possible motivational factors that might mediate such an effect. Under the umbrella of the Authentic Research Connection (ARC) program, we used institutional and survey data from nine semesters and compared ARC participants to non-participants, who applied to ARC but either were not randomly selected or were selected but chose not to enroll in an ARC section. We found that ARC had significant effects on demographic groups historically less likely to be retained in STEM: ARC participation resulted in narrowing the gaps in graduation rates in STEM (first vs continuing-generation college students) and in intention to major in STEM [females vs males, Persons Excluded because of Ethnicity or Race (PEERs) vs non-PEERs]. These disproportionate boosts in intending STEM majors among ARC students coincide with their reporting a greater sense of student cohesiveness, retaining more interest in biology, and commenting more frequently that the course provided a useful/valuable learning experience. Our results indicate that CUREs can be a valuable tool for eliminating inequities in STEM participation, and we make several recommendations for further research.",2023,Dec,J Microbiol Biol Educ,24,3,,,10.1128/jmbe.00225-22,38108006,#611,Bradshaw 2023,"",""

We studied factors affecting faculty at risk for attrition, defined as women, racial/ethnic underrepresented minorities (URM), and clinical faculty. Identification of factors predicting retention of at-risk faculty may help mentors and minority-serving institutions devise novel targeted retention strategies. Our study site was a minority-serving institution in a majority-minority state in the US Southwest where at-risk faculty constitute the majority group. Faculty characteristics and departure dates were extracted from an institutional database maintained by the University of New Mexico (UNM) School of Medicine (SOM) for 2,427 participants employed from July 2009 through June 2022. Annual attrition rates and relative risk (RR) of attrition were estimated by discrete-time hazard rate models assuming a Poisson distribution. The overall annual attrition rate was 11.5%, which projects to 50% attrition in 6.0 years. Time to 50% attrition was 4.6 years for assistant professors, 8.9 years for associate professors 7.2 years for full professors.

"Investigating the US biomedical workforce: Gender, field of training, and retention.",Winkler AE; Levin SG; Allison MT,"The biomedical research workforce plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and improving public health through discoveries and innovations. This study fills a knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive portrait of this workforce and retention within it. A distinguishing feature is that we use an occupation-based definition which allows us to look 'backward' to field of training and assess the extent to which it has grown more interdisciplinary, and how this differs by gender. The analysis is conducted using restricted-use SESTAT data, the most comprehensive dataset on the scientific workforce in the USA, for the years 1993, 2003, and 2010. Among the findings, we identify differences in interdisciplinarity in training by gender, and these differences have widened. In the retention analysis, which focuses on the 7-year period, 2003-10, we find that retention is negatively and significantly associated with interdisciplinary training for women, but not for men.",2019,Dec,Sci Public Policy,46,6,913-926,,10.1093/scipol/scz039,31885414,#614,Winkler 2019,"",""
Development of a predictive tool for sacral nerve modulation implantation in the treatment of non-obstructive urinary retention and/or slow urinary stream: a study from the Neuro-Urology Committee of the French Association of Urology.,Nasri J; Al Ashimi I; Tricard T; Fleury R; Matta I; Bey E; Mesnard B; Gaillet S; Martin C; Game X; Thuillier C; Chartier-Kastler E; Karsenty G; Perrouin-Verbe MA; Demeestere A; Wagner L; Ruffion A; Peyronnet B; Saussine C; Phé V; Vermersch P; De Wachter S; Biardeau X,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to seek predictive factors and develop a predictive tool for sacral nerve modulation (SNM) implantation in patients with non-obstructive urinary retention and/or slow urinary stream (NOUR/SS). METHODS: This study was designed as a retrospective study including all patients who have undergone a two-stage SNM for NOUR/SS between 2000 and 2021 in 11 academic hospitals. The primary outcome was defined as the implantation rate. Secondary outcomes included changes in bladder emptying parameters. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed and determined odds ratio for IPG implantation to build a predictive tool. The performance of the multivariable model discrimination was evaluated using the c-statistics and an internal validation was performed using bootstrap resampling. RESULTS: Of the 357 patients included, 210 (58.8%) were finally implanted. After multivariable logistic regression, 4 predictive factors were found, including age (≤ 52 yo; OR = 3.31 (CI95%) [1.79; 6.14]), gender (female; OR = 2.62 (CI95%) [1.39; 4.92]), maximal urethral closure pressure (≥ 70 cmH(2)O; OR: 2.36 (CI95%) [1.17; 4.74]), and the absence of an underlying neurological disease affecting the lower motor neuron (OR = 2.25 (CI95%) [1.07; 4.76]). Combining these factors, we established 16 response profiles with distinct IPG implantation rates, ranging from 8.7 to 81.5%. Internal validation found a good discrimination value (c-statistic, 0.724; 95% CI 0.660-0.789) with a low optimism bias (0.013). This allowed us to develop a predictive tool ( https://predictivetool.wixsite.com/void ).

Recruitment and retention of emerging adults in lifestyle interventions: Findings from the REACH trial.,LaRose JG; Reading JM; Lanoye A; Brown KL,"OBJECTIVE: Emerging adulthood (EA) is a critical time to promote cardiometabolic health, but EAs are underrepresented in lifestyle intervention trials. Knowledge gaps exist regarding how best to recruit and retain sociodemographically diverse EAs. Our goal was to begin to address these gaps using data from the Richmond Emerging Adults Choosing Health (REACH) Trial. METHODS: REACH was a comparative efficacy trial for EAs, age 18-25, with a body mass index of 25-45 kg/m(2). Enrollment goals were: N = 381, ≥40% underrepresented race/ethnicity, ≥30% men, ≥85% retention at 6 months. We translated formative work into a recruitment and retention plan, examined yield for recruitment and retention overall, and by gender and race/ethnicity, as well as cost data. Descriptive statistics and chi square tests were used. RESULTS: Enrollment benchmarks were met overall (N = 382) and for participants from underrepresented race/ethnic backgrounds (58.0%), but not men (17.3%). The most common recruitment sources were email (26.9%), radio (22.2%), and online radio (15.4%); this pattern largely held true across gender and race/ethnic groups, though word of mouth and participant referral together accounted for nearly a quarter of enrolled men. Costs averaged $155 per randomized participant. Retention was 89% at 3-months, 84% at 6-months (primary endpoint) and 80% at 12-months (follow-up), with no significant differences by gender or race/ethnicity (all p's > 0.05). Retention did not differ by recruitment method (p = .69).

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual participant level data (IPD). DATA SOURCES: Clinical trial repositories (Clinical Study Data Request and Yale University Open Data Access). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Eligible phase 3 or 4 trials identified according to prespecified criteria (PROSPERO CRD42018048202). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between comorbidity count (identified using medical history or concomitant drug treatment data) and trial attrition (failure for any reason to complete the final trial visit), estimated in logistic regression models and adjusted for age and sex. Estimates were meta-analysed in bayesian linear models, with partial pooling across index conditions and drug classes. RESULTS: In 92 trials across 20 index conditions and 17 drug classes, the mean comorbidity count ranged from 0.3 to 2.7. Neither age nor sex was clearly associated with attrition (odds ratio 1.04, 95% credible interval 0.98 to 1.11; and 0.99, 0.93 to 1.05, respectively). However, comorbidity count was associated with trial attrition (odds ratio per additional comorbidity 1.11, 95% credible interval 1.07 to 1.14). No evidence of non-linearity (assessed via a second order polynomial) was seen in the association between comorbidity count and trial attrition, with minimal variation across drug classes and index conditions. At a trial level, an increase in participant comorbidity count has a minor impact on attrition: for a notional trial with high level of attrition in individuals without comorbidity, doubling the mean comorbidity count from 1 to 2 translates to an increase in trial attrition from 29% to 31%. CONCLUSIONS: Increased comorbidity count, irrespective of age and sex, is associated with a modest increased odds of participant attrition. The benefit of increased generalisability of including participants with multimorbidity seems likely to outweigh the disadvantages of increased attrition.",2022,,BMJ Med,1,1,e000217,,10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000217,36936559,#619,Lees 2022,"",""

DESIGN: A retrospective panel study was conducted using the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster database. METHODS: We used the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster data to assess trends in academic faculty promotions within U.S. ophthalmology departments. Full-time assistant and associate professors appointed between 2000 and 2010 were included in the analysis, and tracked until November 2021 to determine promotion rates. Pearson χ(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in promotion and retention rates based on gender, race and ethnicity, advanced degree, and tenure status. RESULTS: The demographics of 1436 assistant and 680 associate faculty members were obtained for analysis through the Association of American Medical Colleges. Black faculty had lower promotion rates when compared with White faculty (20% vs 37%, P < .001). Faculty with MD and PhD degrees demonstrated higher promotion rates than faculty with MD degrees alone (59% vs 36%, P < .001). In addition, faculty not on tenure track had lower rates of promotion than those on tenure track (35% vs 48%, P < .001). With respect to faculty retention, among assistant and associate professors combined, Black faculty and faculty without tenure track appointments were more likely to leave academic medicine (46% vs 33%, P < .001) and (36% vs 27%, P < .001), respectively.

METHODS: Participants (16,711; 16-80 years; 37% females, 34% Qatari) used a pedometer or smartphone application (app) to measure step count. Absolute adherence (ADH) and retention (RET) were calculated, with ADH (%) the ratio between number of days data and SIH enrollment length (RET). Linear Mixed Models identified differences in ADH between RET groups, main effects (i.e., sex, device, age, BMI, nationality) and interaction effects for ADH (RET entered as a covariate). RESULTS: Average ADH and RET to SIH (irrespective of sex, age, device and BMI) was 50% (±31%), and 16% (±20%), respectively, with ADH differing significantly between RET groups (F = 460.2, p < 0.001). RET (as a covariate) revealed a significant main effect for device (F = 12.00, p < 0.001) and age (F = 4.31, p = 0.001) on ADH observed. There was a significant association between RET and sex (p < 0.001), device (p < 0.001), and age groups 16-25 y (p < 0.001), and 26-35 y (p < 0.001).

PARTICIPANTS: 1409 children aged 4-16 years attending with a torus (buckle) fracture, and their parents/guardian. Children's mean age was 9.2 years, 41.0% were female, 77.4% were ethnically White and 90.0% spoke English as a first language. INTERVENTIONS: Participants and their parents/guardian received trial information either via multimedia, including animated videos, talking head videos and text (revised for readability and age appropriateness when needed) on tablet computer (MMI group; n=681), or printed participant information sheet (PIS group; n=728). OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was recruitment rate to FORCE.

Bone turnover markers: Emerging tool in the management of osteoporosis.,Shetty S; Kapoor N; Bondu JD; Thomas N; Paul TV,"Bone is a dynamic tissue which undergoes constant remodeling throughout the life span. Bone turnover is balanced with coupling of bone formation and resorption at various rates leading to continuous remodeling of bone. A study of bone turnover markers (BTMs) provides an insight of the dynamics of bone turnover in many metabolic bone disorders. An increase in bone turnover seen with aging and pathological states such as osteoporosis leads to deterioration of bone microarchitecture and thus contributes to an increase in the risk of fracture independent of low bone mineral density (BMD). These microarchitectural alterations affecting the bone quality can be assessed by BTMs and thus may serve as a complementary tool to BMD in the assessment of fracture risk. A systematic search of literature regarding BTMs was carried out using the PubMed database for the purpose of this review. Various reliable, rapid, and cost-effective automated assays of BTMs with good sensitivity are available for the management of osteoporosis. However, BTMs are subjected to various preanalytical and analytical variations necessitating strict sample collection and assays methods along with utilizing ethnicity-based reference standards for different populations. Estimation of fracture risk and monitoring the adherence and response to therapy, which is a challenge in a chronic, asymptomatic disease such as osteoporosis, are the most important applications of measuring BTMs. This review describes the physiology of bone remodeling, various conventional and novel BTMs, and BTM assays and their role in the assessment of fracture risk and monitoring response to treatment with antiresorptive or anabolic agents.",2016,Nov-Dec,Indian J Endocrinol Metab,20,6,846-852,,10.4103/2230-8210.192914,27867890,#624,Shetty 2016,"",""
Where Are They Now? Attrition Rates of Emergency Medicine Residency Graduates by Gender.,Salker NA; Fang A; Lall M; Bond M; White M; Agrawal P; Sethuraman KN,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Prior studies examined the retention of women emergency physicians through residency training, but their career paths on completing residency are less well understood. Our primary objective was to identify a difference in attrition rates between binary genders of practicing clinical emergency physicians within 10 to 30 years after residency graduation. Our secondary aims investigated gender differences in geographic practice location, academic, and community practice. We hypothesized that women emergency physicians have higher rates of attrition from clinical practice than men. METHODS: In this cohort study, we tracked employment over 10 to 30 years of graduates from allopathic emergency medicine residency programs established before 2005 and those who graduated before 2010. We obtained graduate lists from 21 residency programs representing geographically diverse training programs in the United States. We utilized public databases to investigate current licensure, board certification, practice location, and occupation for graduates more than 10 years after residency graduation. Physicians who do not practice clinically in emergency medicine or an emergency medicine subspecialty were placed in the ""attrition"" category. ""Not available"" was defined as those individuals who did not have adequate information available online. We analyzed differences in attrition of women and men emergency physicians in clinical practice in 2020. We also noted whether they worked in an academic or community setting and assessed their geographic clinical practice region. RESULTS: We identified a total of 4,170 graduates. Of those, 445 (10.6%) were excluded because of insufficient information. Of the 3,725 emergency medicine residency graduates, 71% were men. The attrition rate from clinical emergency medicine for men was 5.3% (95% confidence interval, 4.4% to 6.1%) and the attrition rate for women was 5.8% (95% confidence interval, 4.4% to 7.2%). The difference between the 2 proportions was -0.005 (95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.01). There were no gender differences in geographic location or practice type. CONCLUSION: We did not observe differences in attrition rates by gender in our sample from 21 programs over a 30-year period.

Interventions to improve or facilitate linkage to or retention in pre-ART (HIV) care and initiation of ART in low- and middle-income settings--a systematic review.,Govindasamy D; Meghij J; Kebede Negussi E; Clare Baggaley R; Ford N; Kranzer K,"INTRODUCTION: Several approaches have been taken to reduce pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) losses between HIV testing and ART initiation in low- and middle-income countries, but a systematic assessment of the evidence has not yet been undertaken. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the potential for interventions to improve or facilitate linkage to or retention in pre-ART care and initiation of ART in low- and middle-income settings. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and conference databases to identify studies describing interventions aimed at improving linkage to or retention in pre-ART care or initiation of ART. Additional searches were conducted to identify on-going trials on this topic, and experts in the field were contacted. An assessment of the risk of bias was conducted. Interventions were categorized according to key domains in the existing literature. RESULTS: A total of 11,129 potentially relevant citations were identified, of which 24 were eligible for inclusion, with the majority (n=21) from sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, 15 on-going trials were identified. The most common interventions described under key domains included: health system interventions (i.e. integration in the setting of antenatal care); patient convenience and accessibility (i.e. point-of-care CD4 count (POC) testing with immediate results, home-based ART initiation); behaviour interventions and peer support (i.e. improved communication, patient referral and education) and incentives (i.e. food support). Several interventions showed favourable outcomes: integration of care and peer supporters increased enrolment into HIV care, medical incentives increased pre-ART retention, POC CD4 testing and food incentives increased completion of ART eligibility screening and ART initiation. Most studies focused on the general adult patient population or pregnant women. The majority of published studies were observational cohort studies, subject to an unclear risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that streamlining services to minimize patient visits, providing adequate medical and peer support, and providing incentives may decrease attrition, but the quality of the current evidence base is low. Few studies have investigated combined interventions, or assessed the impact of interventions across the HIV cascade.

METHOD: Using qualitative interviews (n = 26), we compared women veterans from racial and ethnic minority groups who completed (completers; n = 16) and did not complete (noncompleters; n = 11) webSTAIR at rural-serving facilities in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Interview data were analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis. Chi-square and t tests assessed differences between completers and noncompleters by sociodemographic characteristics and baseline PTSD and depression symptomatology. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant sociodemographic differences at baseline between completers and noncompleters; completers reported significantly higher baseline PTSD and depression symptomatology. Noncompleters were more likely to describe feeling angry, depressed, and unable to control their environments during participation in the program as barriers to webSTAIR completion. Completers, despite higher symptomatology, cited internal motivation and support from concurrent mental health services as facilitators. Both groups made recommendations for how VA can better support women veterans from racial and ethnic minority groups, including providing space for peer support and community building, addressing stigma associated with seeking mental health services and fostering mental health provider diversity and retention. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although previous research has identified racial and ethnic disparities in PTSD treatment retention, mechanisms to improve retention have been unclear.

Postpartum weight retention in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,Lee I; Alur-Gupta S; Gallop R; Dokras A,"BACKGROUND: Compared with women without polycystic ovary syndrome, women with polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. Postpartum weight retention has been shown to contribute to these risks in the general population, but little is known about postpartum weight retention among women with polycystic ovary syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare postpartum weight retention and peripartum weight trends between women with polycystic ovary syndrome and controls. STUDY DESIGN: Data on live, full-term singleton deliveries from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2019, in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Weights during the pregestational period, pregnancy, and up to 12 months postpartum were collected. The primary outcome was likelihood of high postpartum weight retention of ≥5 kg above pregestational weight at 12 months after delivery. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of high weight retention at other postpartum time points (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months), absolute postpartum weight retention, gestational weight gain, and excess weight gain above the Institute of Medicine guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 6333 women had the requisite weight information (pregestational, peak pregnancy, and at least 1 postpartum weight), including 429 (6.8%) with polycystic ovary syndrome. After adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index, race, gestational diabetes mellitus, and parity, women with polycystic ovary syndrome were less likely to be high weight retainers at 6 weeks after delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71; P=.02). There was no difference in postpartum weight retention between groups at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery. Overall, the prevalence of high weight retainers at 12 months after delivery was high in both groups (22.7% in polycystic ovary syndrome vs 29.2% in controls; P=.13), and there was no difference in absolute weight retention (1.69 kg in polycystic ovary syndrome vs 2.05 kg in controls; P=.25). Although women with polycystic ovary syndrome had a higher pregestational body mass index, they had lower gestational weight gain (median, 12.7 kg) than controls (median, 13.5 kg) (P=.01). These findings were driven by the group with obesity. The percentage of women who surpassed the Institute of Medicine guidelines for gestational weight gain based on the body mass index category was similar between groups (43.4% in polycystic ovary syndrome vs 47.3% in controls; P=.12). Overall, 18.5% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 23.4% of controls had a higher body mass index category at 12 months after delivery than before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome had lower gestational weight gain and lower likelihood of high weight retention at 6 weeks after delivery but similar weight retention at 12 months after delivery compared with controls. Overall, the large proportion of women with high postpartum weight retention highlights the importance of the peripartum time period for weight management, particularly in this high-risk group predisposed to obesity and cardiometabolic disease.",2021,Jan,Am J Obstet Gynecol,224,1,76.e1-76.e10,,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.07.033,32712005,#629,Lee 2021,"",""

Over this time, we find that hiring had a far greater impact on women's representation among faculty than attrition in the majority (90.1%) of academic fields, even as academia loses a higher share of women faculty relative to men at every career stage. Finally, we model the impact of five specific policy interventions on women's representation, and project that eliminating attrition differences between women and men only leads to a marginal increase in women's overall representation-in most fields, successful interventions will need to make substantial and sustained changes to hiring in order to reach gender parity.",2024,Jul,Elife,13,,,,10.7554/eLife.93755,38984481,#630,LaBerge 2024,"",""
Associations among temperament characteristics and telomere length and attrition rate in early childhood.,Bosquet Enlow M; De Vivo I; Petty CR; Cayon N; Nelson CA,"There is growing interest in telomere length as an indicator of current and future health. Although early childhood is a period of rapid telomere attrition, little is known about the factors that influence telomere biology during this time. Adult research suggests that telomere length is influenced by psychological characteristics. This study's goal was to test associations among repeated measures of temperament and telomere length in a community sample of children (N = 602; 52% male, 73% non-Hispanic White, middle-to-high socioeconomic status) from infancy to age 3 years. Relative telomere length was assessed from DNA in saliva samples collected at infancy (M = 8.4 months), 2 years (M = 24.9 months), and 3 years (M = 37.8 months). Temperament was assessed via maternal report questionnaires administered at infancy (Infant Behavior Report Questionnaire-Revised) and ages 2 and 3 years (Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire). Temperament was operationalized in two ways: using the established domains of negative affectivity, surgency/extraversion, and regulation/effortful control and using person-centered scores that identified three groups of children with similar profiles across domains (emotionally and behaviorally regulated; emotionally and behaviorally dysregulated; introverted and overcontrolled). Analyses revealed that greater regulation/effortful control was associated with longer telomere length across time points. Additionally, higher surgency/extraversion, beginning in infancy, was associated with decreased rate of telomere attrition. There were no sex differences in the relations between temperament and telomere measures. These findings suggest that, as early as infancy, temperament may influence telomere biology, with a potential protective effect of positive temperament characteristics on telomere erosion.

"Telomere Attrition in Human Lens Epithelial Cells Associated with Oxidative Stress Provide a New Therapeutic Target for the Treatment, Dissolving and Prevention of Cataract with N-Acetylcarnosine Lubricant Eye Drops. Kinetic, Pharmacological and Activity-",Babizhayev MA; Yegorov YE,"BACKGROUND: Visual impairment broadly impacts the ability of affected people to maintain their function and to remain independent during their daily occupations as they grow older. Visual impairment affects survival of older patients, quality of life, can affect a person's self-ranking of health, may be associated with social and functional decline, use of community support services, depression, falls, nursing home placement, and increased mortality. It has been hypothesized that senile cataract may serve as a marker for generalised tissue aging, since structural changes occurring in the proteins of the lens during cataract formation are similar to those which occur elsewhere as part of the aging process. The published analysis revealed a strong age-dependent relationship between undergoing cataract surgery and subsequent mortality. METHODS: Nuclear opacity, particularly severe nuclear opacity, and mixed opacities with nuclear were significant predictors of mortality independent of body mass index, comorbid conditions, smoking, age, race, and sex. The lens opacity status is considered as an independent predictor of 2-year mortality, an association that could not be explained by potential confounders. Telomeres have become important biomarkers for aging as well as for oxidative stress-related disease. The lens epithelium is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress. Oxidative damage to the cuboidal epithelial cells on the anterior surface of the lens mediated by reactive oxygen species and phospholipid hydroperoxides can precede and contribute to human lens cataract formation. The erosion and shortening of telomeres in human lens epithelial cells in the lack of telomerase activity has been recognized as a primary cause of premature lens senescence phenotype that trigger human cataractogenesis. In this study we aimed to be focused on research defining the mechanisms that underlie linkages among telomere attrition in human lens epithelial cells associated with oxidative stress, biology of the lens response to oxidative damages, aging and health, cataract versus neuroendocrine regulation and disease. The cumulative results demonstrate that carnosine, released ophthalmically from the patented 1% Nacetylcarnosine prodrug lubricant eye drops, at physiological concentration might remarkably reduce the rate of telomere shortening in the lens cells subjected to oxidative stress in the lack of efficient antioxidant lens protection. Carnosine promotes the protection of normal cells from acquiring phenotypic characteristics of cellular senescence. The data of visual functions (visual acuity, glare sensitivity) in older adult subjects and older subjects with cataract treated with 1% N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops showed significant improvement as compared, by contrast with the control group which showed generally no improvement in visual functions, with no difference from baseline in visual acuity and glare sensitivity readings. RESULTS: N-acetylcarnosine derived from the lubricant eye drops may be transported into the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) histamine neurons and gradually hydrolyzed. The resulting L-histidine may subsequently be converted into histamine, which could be responsible for the effects of carnosine on neurotransmission and hormone-like antiaging and anti-cataract physiological function. CONCLUSION: The research utilizing the N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops powerful therapeutic platform provides the findings related to the intraocular uptake exposure sources as well as a timing dosage and duration systemic absorption of said preparation from the conjunctional sac reaching the hypothalamus with activities transfer into the hypothalamic-neuroendocrine pathways affecting across the hypothalamus metabolic pathway the telomere biology and cataract disease occurrence, reversal and prevention and the average expected lifespan of an individual. Such findings can be translated into clinical practice and may provide a basis for personalized cataract disease and aging prevention and treatment approaches.",2016,,Recent Pat Drug Deliv Formul,10,2,82-129,,10.2174/1872211309666150618104657,26084629,#633,Babizhayev 2016,"",""

METHODS: A secondary analysis of a longitudinal randomized controlled self-management for breast and nipple pain during breastfeeding study. Participants completed online surveys at discharge, weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24, with face-to-face interviews at 6 and 24 weeks. Text messages were sent to participants when modules and surveys were due. Retention was assessed in R with descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney, Pearson's chi-square, and Cox Proportional Hazard Regression. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-four women (89 ≤$50,000 and 155 >$50,000) were recruited. Retention rates at 1 (93%), 2 (87%), 6 (82%), 9 (77%) and 24 (72%) weeks. For women of low income compared to those of high income there was a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.5 (p=0.0001) for retention. For non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women compared to the combined non-Hispanic White and Other group, HRs for retention were 3.3 and 2.6 respectively (p=0.0001). Adjustment for age in the final hazard regression model of income, age, race and ethnicity decreased the HR for women of low income to 1.6 and HRs for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women to 2.1 and 1.9, respectively (p=.0001).

Female peer mentors early in college increase women's positive academic experiences and retention in engineering.,Dennehy TC; Dasgupta N,"Scientific and engineering innovation is vital for American competitiveness, quality of life, and national security. However, too few American students, especially women, pursue these fields. Although this problem has attracted enormous attention, rigorously tested interventions outside artificial laboratory settings are quite rare. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment investigating the effect of peer mentoring on women's experiences and retention in engineering during college transition, assessing its impact for 1 y while mentoring was active, and an additional 1 y after mentoring had ended. Incoming women engineering students (n = 150) were randomly assigned to female or male peer mentors or no mentors for 1 y. Their experiences were assessed multiple times during the intervention year and 1-y postintervention. Female (but not male) mentors protected women's belonging in engineering, self-efficacy, motivation, retention in engineering majors, and postcollege engineering aspirations. Counter to common assumptions, better engineering grades were not associated with more retention or career aspirations in engineering in the first year of college. Notably, increased belonging and self-efficacy were significantly associated with more retention and career aspirations. The benefits of peer mentoring endured long after the intervention had ended, inoculating women for the first 2 y of college-the window of greatest attrition from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Thus, same-gender peer mentoring for a short period during developmental transition points promotes women's success and retention in engineering, yielding dividends over time.",2017,Jun,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,114,23,5964-5969,,10.1073/pnas.1613117114,28533360,#637,Dennehy 2017,"",""

Retention of dental practitioners in rural health services in Iran: Experiences from Kerman province.,Amiresmaili M; Jamebozorgi MH; Jamebozorgi AH; Arab-Zozani M,"BACKGROUND: In Iran, the inequitable distribution of health-care staff, especially dental practitioners between rural and urban areas has a major impact on the delivery of care for those living in rural communities. This study investigated the factors affecting the retention of dental practitioners to stay in the rural areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in 2019. All dental practitioners working in health services centers covering a population lower than 20,000 people in Kerman province participated in this study (n = 81). A researcher-designed questionnaire was used for the data collection. The data were analyzed using the descriptive statistics and logistic regression through the SPSS software. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 29.2 ± 6.5 and 39.5% were female. The results showed that about two-thirds of native dentists (with local origin), 73.3% of married dentists, and all dental practitioners who had no children or had a child under the age of six were willing to continue working with their current Comprehensive centers of health services compared to other dentists. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that there was a significant relationship among dentists' age, monthly salary, and facilities available in the area (place of residence, availability of vehicles, etc.), view of dental practitioners on living in a rural area, and view of dentists' families on living and working in the area (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: More than half of the dental practitioners declared their willingness to stay in rural areas, although, in practice, this amount of presence in rural areas does not meet the needs of residents.

The Relationship Between Job Satisfaction and Faculty Turnover Among Physician Assistant Educators During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Lynch S,"INTRODUCTION: This research explored the relationship between job satisfaction and intent to leave among physician assistant (PA) educators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the study aimed to identify differences in PA educators' job satisfaction within gender and their intention to stay at their current employment. METHODS: A nonexperimental, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1788 PA educators at 232 accredited programs nationally. A Web-based survey was employed to measure job satisfaction and intent to leave and to collect demographic information. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population, and logistic regression was used to analyze the independent variables predicting faculty turnover. RESULTS: PA educators were generally satisfied with their jobs (51.2%, n = 251), with the nature of the work, quality of supervision, and collegial relationships contributing the most to job satisfaction. Males were generally more satisfied with their jobs than females. More than half of the PA educators (52.4%, n = 257) considered leaving academia in the past year. Job satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] = .945, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .936-.956) and individual facets-including the nature of the work (OR = .806, 95% CI = .731-.888); communication (OR = .926, 95% CI = .860-.997); and quality of supervision (OR = .904, 95% CI = .850-.960)-were predictive of intent to leave. Gender was not found to significantly affect the relationship between job satisfaction and intent to leave.

Preventing Fluid Retention After Subarachnoid Haemorrhage During Administration of Endothelin Receptor Antagonist.,Okuma Y; Hirahata S; Tanda A; Suzuki K; Shimoda K; Kido G; Kagawa Y,"Prevention of delayed cerebral infarction (DCI) due to cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has been done with intravenous Rho kinase inhibitors (ROCKI), ozagrel sodium (TXA2I), selective ROCKI infusion (ROCKI i.a.), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA, clazosentan) became available in 2022 and is said to be highly recommended for DCI prevention, while fluid retention such as pleural effusion and pulmonary oedema accumulation is often experienced. We investigated the relationship between patient background, fluid retention, and ERA. Ten consecutive SAH patients treated with ERA from July to December 2022 were included. We examined the results of blood sampling on admission, echocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT), with postoperative DCI, and hydrocephalus requiring cerebrospinal fluid shunt (hydro), and symptomatic fluid retention requiring albumin and furosemide (third fluid space).

All patients underwent coil embolisation, and postoperative CSF drainage, ROCKI, TXA2I systemic administration, and ROCKI i.a. There were one DCI, three hydro, and five third fluid cases. Concerning the third fluid, the only significant difference was found in the age. An improvement in fluid retention after ERA discontinuation in old patients was shown. Our experience suggests that age may be the most influential factor.

"Retention in an mHealth App Aiming to Promote the Use of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Among Female Sex Workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: Prospective Cohort Study.",Mbotwa CH; Kazaura MR; Moen K; Leshabari MT; Metta E; Mmbaga EJ,"BACKGROUND: Increasing access to smartphones in sub-Saharan Africa offers an opportunity to leverage mobile health (mHealth) technology to improve access to health care in underserved populations. In the domain of HIV prevention, mHealth interventions can potentially contribute to solving the challenges of suboptimal adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and low retention in PrEP services among populations most vulnerable to HIV acquisition. However, there is a gap in the knowledge about the use of such interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the extent and predictors of retention in an mHealth app (Jichunge) that aims to promote adherence to PrEP and retention in PrEP care among female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: A prospective cohort of female sex workers residing in Dar es Salaam were recruited, using respondent-driven sampling. All participants were provided with the Jichunge app as they started PrEP. A questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographics and other structural factors, while app use data for the 60-day period following the first 150 days of being in the intervention arm were extracted from the app's back end. A multivariable log-binomial model was used to determine predictors of 6-month retention in the Jichunge app. RESULTS: A total of 470 female sex workers were recruited. Nearly three-quarters of participants (206/284, 72.5%) who came to the 6-month follow-up interview no longer had the Jichunge app on their phones. The majority of these participants (193/206, 93.7%) no longer had access to the app because of issues related to their phones. Data extracted from the back end of the app showed that the use of the app declined over time, and only 13.4% (63/470) of the participants were retained (continued to use the app) after 6 months of intervention. At 6 months, women aged ≥35 years were >2 times more likely to use the app than women aged 18 to 24 years (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1; P=.01). Furthermore, retention in the app was higher among participants who demonstrated high PrEP awareness at baseline (aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3; P=.01) and among those who had experienced financial difficulties due to health care spending (aRR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.2; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most female sex workers (206/284, 72.5%) who were enrolled in PrEP care in Tanzania no longer used the Jichunge app after 6 months.

This study investigated whether a vegan diet is associated with increased bone turnover and altered calcium homeostasis due to insufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fractionated and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)-D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and four bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX)) were measured in serum from 78 vegans and 77 omnivores. RESULTS: When adjusting for seasonality and constitutional covariates (age, sex, and body fat percentage) vegans had higher concentrations of PINP (32 [95% CI: 7, 64]%, P = 0.01) and BAP (58 [95% CI: 27, 97]%, P < 0.001) compared to omnivores, whereas CTX (30 [95% CI: -1, 72]%, P = 0.06) and osteocalcin (21.8 [95% CI: -9.3, 63.7]%, P = 0.2) concentrations did not differ between the two groups.

Positive trends in neurosurgery enrollment and attrition: analysis of the 2000-2009 female neurosurgery resident cohort.,Renfrow JJ; Rodriguez A; Liu A; Pilitsis JG; Samadani U; Ganju A; Germano IM; Benzil DL; Wolfe SQ,"OBJECTIVE: Women compose a minority of neurosurgery residents, averaging just over 10% of matched applicants per year during this decade. A recent review by Lynch et al. raises the concern that women may be at a higher risk than men for attrition, based on analysis of a cohort matched between 1990 and 1999. This manuscript aims to characterize the trends in enrollment, attrition, and postattrition careers for women who matched in neurosurgery between 2000 and 2009. METHODS: Databases from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS) were analyzed for all residents who matched into neurosurgery during the years 2000-2009. Residents were sorted by female gender, matched against graduation records, and if graduation was not reported from neurosurgery residency programs, an Internet search was used to determine the residents' alternative path. The primary outcome was to determine the number of women residents who did not complete neurosurgery training programs during 2000-2009. Secondary outcomes included the total number of women who matched into neurosurgery per year, year in training in which attrition occurred, and alternative career paths that these women chose to pursue. RESULTS: Women comprised 240 of 1992 (12%) matched neurosurgery residents during 2000-2009. Among female residents there was a 17% attrition rate, compared with a 5.3% male attrition rate, with an overall attrition rate of 6.7%. The majority who left the field did so within the first 3 years of neurosurgical training and stayed in medicine--pursuing anesthesia, neurology, and radiology. CONCLUSIONS: Although the percentage of women entering neurosurgical residency has continued to increase, this number is still disproportionate to the overall number of women in medicine. The female attrition rate in neurosurgery in the 2000-2009 cohort is comparable to that of the other surgical specialties, but for neurosurgery, there is disparity between the male and female attrition rates. Women who left the field tended to stay within medicine and usually pursued a neuroscience-related career.

A systematic review of medical practitioners' retention and application of basic sciences to clinical practice.,Albert FA; Seidu AA; Mason HM; Anderson E; Alele FO; Heggarty P; Hollins A; Gupta TS; Hays RB; McArthur L; Malau-Aduli BS,"BACKGROUND: Medical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice. However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of 'encapsulated knowledge' demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice. CONCLUSION: Detailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review's findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career.

RESULTS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY: URM faculty hiring is increasing, but is well below the proportions earning doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines. The results are variable and because of the small numbers of URM faculty, the precision and power for comparing URM faculty to other faculty were low. In three of the four institutions, lower fractions of URM faculty than other faculty hired in the 2002-2006 time frame left without tenure. Also, in the biological and biomedical and physical and mathematical sciences no URM faculty left without tenure. On the other hand, at two of the institutions, significantly more URM faculty left before their tenth anniversary than other faculty and in engineering significantly more URM faculty than other faculty left before their tenth anniversary. We did not find significant differences in promotion patterns between URM and other faculty.",2017,,PLoS One,12,11,e0187285,,10.1371/journal.pone.0187285,29091958,#653,Gumpertz 2017,"",""
The genetics of egg retention and fertilization success in Drosophila: One step closer to understanding the transition from facultative to obligate viviparity.,Horváth B; Kalinka AT,"Oviparous, facultative egg retention enables Drosophila females to withhold fertilized eggs in their reproductive tracts until circumstances favor oviposition. The propensity to retain fertilized eggs varies greatly between species, and is correlated with other reproductive traits, such as egg size and ovariole number. While previous studies have described the phenomenon, no study to date has characterized within-species variation or the genetic basis of the trait. Here, we develop a novel microscope-based method for measuring egg retention in Drosophila females and determine the range of phenotypic variation in mated female egg retention in a subset of 91 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines. We inferred the genetic basis of egg retention using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Further, the scoring of more than 95,000 stained, staged eggs enabled estimates of fertilization success for each line. We found evidence that ovary- and spermathecae-related genes as well as genes affecting olfactory behavior, male mating behavior, male-female attraction and sperm motility may play a crucial role in post-mating physiology. Based on our findings we also propose potential evolutionary routes toward obligate viviparity. In particular, we propose that the loss of fecundity incurred by viviparity could be offset by benefits arising from enhanced mate discrimination, resource specialization, or modified egg morphology.",2018,Feb,Evolution,72,2,318-336,Dryad/10.5061/dryad.083f9,10.1111/evo.13411,29265369,#654,Horváth 2018,"",""
"Disentangling the relationship between bone turnover and glucose homeostasis: A prospective, population-based twin study.",Dalgård C; Hansen MS; Möller S; Kyvik KO; Frost M,"BACKGROUND: Biochemical markers of bone turnover are lower in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may be explained by genetic variants being associated with type 2 diabetes and bone turnover as well as environmental factors. We hypothesized that bone turnover markers associate with and predict changes in glucose homeostasis after control for genetics and shared environment. METHODS: 1071 healthy, non-diabetic (at baseline, 1997-2000) adult mono- and dizygotic twins participating in the prospective study GEMINAKAR were reassessed between 2010 and 2012 with clinical evaluation, biochemical tests and oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting bone turnover markers (CTX, P1NP and osteocalcin) were measured. The association between bone turnover, glucose homeostasis and the ability of bone turnover markers to predict changes in glucose homeostasis were assessed in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Analyses were performed both at an individual level and adjusted for shared environmental and genetic factors. RESULTS: Glucose levels increased with age, and 33 (3%) participants had developed type 2 diabetes at follow-up. In women, bone turnover markers increased with age, whereas for men only osteocalcin increased with age. Bone turnover markers were not associated with fasting glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR at baseline or follow-up before or after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and use of medication at baseline. Variation in bone turnover markers was mainly explained by unique environmental factors, 70%, 70% and 55% for CTX, P1NP and osteocalcin, respectively, whereas additive genetic factors explained 7%, 13% and 45% of the variation in CTX, P1NP and osteocalcin. CONCLUSIONS: Bone turnover markers were not associated with baseline plasma glucose levels and did not predict changes in glucose homeostasis. Variation in bone turnover markers is mainly explained by environmental factors, however, compared to CTX and P1NP, genetic factors have a larger impact on osteocalcin levels.",2021,Jun,Bone Rep,14,,100752,,10.1016/j.bonr.2021.100752,33665235,#655,Dalgård 2021,"",""
Intervening during and after pregnancy to prevent weight retention among African American women.,Herring SJ; Cruice JF; Bennett GG; Darden N; Wallen JJ; Rose MZ; Davey A; Foster GD,"Efforts to prevent postpartum weight retention in extant clinical trials of African American women have proven exceedingly challenging. The primary purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether a behavioral intervention implemented in early pregnancy through 6 months postpartum could increase the proportion of African American women who were at or below their early pregnancy weights by 6 months postpartum. We additionally evaluated whether mothers' postpartum weight loss could be maintained at 12 months postpartum. Participants were 66 socioeconomically disadvantaged African American women (36% overweight, 64% obese) randomly assigned to a behavioral intervention or usual care group. The intervention, implemented from early pregnancy to 6 months postpartum, promoted weight control through: (1) empirically supported behavior change goals; (2) interactive self-monitoring text messages; (3) weekly to monthly health coach calls; and (4) skills training and support through Facebook. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, participants assigned to the intervention were significantly more likely to be at or below their early pregnancy weights by 6 months postpartum compared to usual care (56% vs. 29%, p = 0.04). At 12 months postpartum, the maternal weight difference between intervention and usual care groups was not maintained (41% vs. 38% respectively at or below early pregnancy weights, p = 0.83). Findings suggest that a combined pregnancy and postpartum weight control intervention improves 6 month weight outcomes in socioeconomically disadvantaged African American women with obesity.

The Challenges and Issues of Undergraduate Student Retention and Attainment in UK Veterinary Medical Education.,Jackson EL; Armitage-Chan E,"Student retention and attainment has recently been identified as a key area for development in veterinary medical education enquiry. Woodfield's research on retention and attainment across the UK disciplines has yielded some unique information about the challenges and issues of students who study veterinary medicine and related subjects. The present literature review aims to expand on Woodfield's findings and explain important issues about retention and attainment across veterinary medicine. Overall, the subject of retention and attainment in undergraduate veterinary medical education needs a great deal more empirical attention, such as data on the retention and attainment of mature and widening access students, and the effects of students being placed at remote locations during their studies. Our findings also cover some unsurprising issues: the dominance of women in a profession that is principally lead by men, the underrepresentation of black and minority ethnic (BME) students in veterinary medicine, and the effects of content overload in the veterinary medical curriculum.

Uptake and Short-Term Retention in HIV Treatment Among Men in South Africa: The Coach Mpilo Pilot Project.,Hlongwa M; Cornell M; Malone S; Pitsillides P; Little K; Hasen N,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparities persist across the HIV care continuum in sub-Saharan Africa. Men are tested, linked, and retained at lower rates than women. Men experience more treatment interruptions, resulting in higher rates of virological failure and increased mortality. Peer support is an approach to improving men's engagement and retention in HIV treatment. We assessed uptake and early retention in HIV care among men in the 'Coach Mpilo' peer support pilot project in South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a pilot project from March 2020 to September 2020 in 3 districts: Ehlanzeni and Gert Sibande (Mpumalanga) and Ugu (KwaZulu-Natal). Men living with HIV were invited to receive one-on-one coaching from a peer supporter who was stable on treatment. We analyzed participants' self-reported data on demographics, uptake, and retention in HIV treatment. We described baseline characteristics using summary statistics and reported uptake and early retention proportions overall and by testing history (newly and previously diagnosed). RESULTS: Among 4,182 men living with HIV, most were previously diagnosed (n=2,461, 64%) and uptake was high (92%, n=3,848). Short-term retention was 80% (n=1,979) among men previously diagnosed and 88% (n=1,213) among newly diagnosed. In September 2020, 95% (n=3,653/3,848) of all participants reported being active on HIV treatment, including those retained consistently and those who had interrupted and returned to care. Among participants experiencing treatment interruption after enrolling, the majority (82%, n=464) returned to treatment, largely within 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Improving linkage to and retention in HIV treatment among men is essential for their health and for treatment as prevention. This pilot project provided preliminary evidence that a peer-led support model was acceptable, retained a high proportion of men in the early stages of ART, and supported men returning to care after treatment interruption. These promising results require further investigation to assess impact, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.",2022,Feb,Glob Health Sci Pract,10,1,,,10.9745/GHSP-D-21-00498,35294387,#659,Hlongwa 2022,"",""
"Predictors of Initiation of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder and Retention in Treatment Among U.S. Pregnant Women, 2013-2017.",Nguemeni Tiako MJ; Friedman A; Culhane J; South E; Meisel ZF,"OBJECTIVE: To describe trends and factors associated with medication administration for opioid use disorder (OUD) and retention in treatment among pregnant women with OUD. METHODS: This is a retrospective, nationwide, cross-sectional analysis of treatment episodes for primary OUD among pregnant women from 2013 to 2017. The primary outcome was initiation of methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Secondary outcomes were retention in treatment defined as length of treatment episode lasting six months or greater, and completion of treatment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were applied to describe trends in, and identify factors associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: There were 42,239 treatment episodes for primary OUD among pregnant women who reported using heroin (65.0%, 27,459), synthetic opioid (33.2%, 14,034), or nonprescribed methadone (1.8%, 746) between 2013 and 2017. Medications for OUD were administered in 47.4% (20,013) of episodes. Retention in treatment occurred in 16.6% of episodes without medications for OUD, and 37.8% of episodes with medications for OUD (P=.01). The rate of medication administration for OUD increased from 41.0% in 2013 to 52.0% in 2017; however, retention rates declined from 39.0% to 33.0% among treatment episodes with medication for OUD. History of at least one prior treatment episode was associated with both administration of medications for OUD and retention in treatment. CONCLUSION: In spite of current guidelines, most treatment episodes for OUD during pregnancy did not involve administration of medications for OUD. Although administration of medications for OUD has improved over time, retention in treatment is lagging.

"Debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention in non-oncological femoral megaprosthesis infections: minimum 5 year follow-up.",Asokan A; Ibrahim MS; Thompson JW; Haddad FS,"PURPOSE: Megaprostheses are increasingly utilised outside of the oncological setting, and remain at significant risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Debridement, antibiotic, and implant retention (DAIR) is an established treatment for PJI, however its use in non-oncological patients with femoral megaprostheses has not been widely reported. There are significant differences in patient physiology, treatment goals, and associated risks between these patient cohorts. METHODS: We identified 14 patients who underwent DAIR for a PJI of their femoral megaprostheses, between 2000 and 2014, whom had their index procedure secondary to non-oncological indications. Patients were managed as part of a multidisciplinary team, with our standardised surgical technique including exchange of all mobile parts, and subsequent antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 3 months. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. RESULTS: Patients included six proximal femoral replacements, five distal femoral replacements, and three total femoral replacements. No patients were lost to follow-up. There were six males and eight females, with a mean age of 67.2 years, and mean ASA of 2.3. Nine patients (64.3%) successfully cleared their infection following DAIR at a minimum of 5 year follow-up. Five patients (35.7%) required further revision surgery, with four patients cleared of infection. No patients who underwent DAIR alone suffered complications as a result of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DAIR in these complex patients can lead to successful outcomes, but the risk of further revision remains high. The success rate (64.3%) remains on par with other studies evaluating DAIR in megaprostheses and in primary arthroplasty. This study indicates judicious use of DAIR can be an appropriate part of the treatment algorithm.

"Retention, stability, iron bioavailability and sensory evaluation of extruded rice fortified with iron, folic acid and vitamin B(12).",Jyrwa YW; Palika R; Boddula S; Boiroju NK; Madhari R; Pullakhandam R; Thingnganing L,"Fortification of rice with micronutrients using extrusion technology is considered a sustainable strategy to prevent nutritional deficiencies in general population. The objective of the present study is to assess the retention, stability and iron bioavailability from indigenously developed triple fortified rice (iron, folic acid and vitamin B(12) ) during rinsing and different cooking methods. Further, we also assessed the acceptability of fortified rice in adult human volunteers. The retention of iron during rinsing with excess water was ≥90%, whereas folic acid and vitamin B(12) levels were reduced by ~25% during rinsing. Watertight cooking of rice (in electric cooker or on flame) had no additional effect on the nutrient levels as compared with rinsed rice, implying their stability during cooking. However, cooking with excess water followed by decanting led to loss of 45% iron and ≥70% folic acid and vitamin B(12) . The dialyzable iron and ferritin synthesis in Caco-2 cells was significantly (P < .01) higher from fortified rice compared with unfortified rice. In addition, inclusion of ascorbic acid significantly (P < .01) increased the iron bioavailability from the fortified rice. Triangle tests in adult human subjects revealed that there are no significant sensory differences among fortified and unfortified rice. Further, fortified rice consumption appears to bridge the gaps in dietary iron intake deficits in children and women of reproductive age.

Attrition in surgical residency programmes: Causes and effects.,Nadeem M; Effendi MS; Hammad Ather M,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate and trend of attrition from a surgical residency programme and to identify the reasons for attrition. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted at a university hospital. Separate questionnaires were designed for residents and programme directors (PDs). The residents who left the training voluntarily from one of the five surgical residency programmes (i.e., general surgery, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, otorhinolaryngology and urology) during the academic years 2005-2011 were identified from a departmental database. The residents who did not respond after three attempts at contact, or those who refused to participate, were excluded. RESULTS: During the last 6 years, 106 residents were recruited; 84 (78%) were men, of whom 34.5% left the programme voluntarily. Of 22 women, half (54%) left the programme voluntarily (P = 0.07). The overall 6-year attrition rate was 39%. The reasons identified for attrition, in descending order, were personal reasons, attitude of senior residents or faculty, and change of specialty. None of the residents cited an excess workload as a reason for their leaving the programme. About 40% rejoined the same specialty after leaving, while 35% chose a different specialty (80% chose a different surgical subspecialty and 20% chose medicine). There was a significant discrepancy in the perspective of residents and PDs about the reasons for attrition. CONCLUSION: Attrition among surgical residents, in particular woman residents, is high.

Adapting mHealth Interventions (PrEPmate and DOT Diary) to Support PrEP Retention in Care and Adherence Among English and Spanish-Speaking Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender Women in the United States: Formative Work and Pilot Randomized Trial.,Liu AY; Alleyne CD; Doblecki-Lewis S; Koester KA; Gonzalez R; Vinson J; Scott H; Buchbinder S; Torres TS,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of mobile health (mHealth) technologies are being developed to support HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and persistence; however, most tools have focused on men who have sex with men (MSM), and few are available in Spanish. To maximize the potential impact of these tools in reducing gender and racial/ethnic disparities and promoting health equity, mHealth tools tailored to Spanish-speaking people and transgender women are critically needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to adapt and tailor 2 mHealth technologies, PrEPmate and DOT Diary, to support daily PrEP adherence and persistence among Spanish-speaking MSM and English- and Spanish-speaking transgender women and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of these tools. METHODS: PrEPmate, an interactive, bidirectional, text messaging intervention that promotes personalized communication between PrEP users and providers, and DOT Diary, a mobile app that promotes self-management of PrEP use and sexual health through an integrated electronic pill-taking and sexual activity diary, were previously developed for English-speaking MSM. We conducted 3 focus groups with 15 English- and Spanish-speaking transgender women and MSM in San Francisco and Miami to culturally tailor these tools for these priority populations. We then conducted a 1-month technical pilot among 21 participants to assess the usability and acceptability of the adapted interventions and optimize the functionality of these tools. RESULTS: Participants in focus groups liked the ""human touch"" of text messages in PrEPmate and thought it would be helpful for scheduling appointments and asking questions. They liked the daily reminder messages, especially the fun facts, gender affirmations, and transgender history topics. Participants recommended changes to tailor the language and messages for Spanish-speaking and transgender populations. For DOT Diary, participants liked the adherence tracking and protection level feedback and thought the calendar functions were easy to use. Based on participant recommendations, we tailored language within the app for Spanish-speaking MSM and transgender women, simplified the sexual diary, and added motivational badges. In the technical pilot of the refined tools, mean System Usability Scale scores were 81.2/100 for PrEPmate and 76.4/100 for DOT Diary (P=.48), falling in the ""good"" to ""excellent"" range, and mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire scores were 28.6 and 28.3 for PrEPmate and DOT Diary, respectively (maximum possible score=32). Use of both tools was high over the 1-month pilot (average of 10.5 messages received from each participant for PrEPmate; average of 17.6 times accessing the DOT Diary app), indicating good feasibility for both tools. CONCLUSIONS: Using a user-centered design approach, we culturally tailored PrEPmate and DOT Diary to support daily PrEP use among Spanish-speaking MSM and English- and Spanish-speaking transgender women.

However, little is known about non-physician practitioner durability and demographic trends in emergency departments. Our objective was to examine attrition rates and ages among non-physician practitioners in emergency medicine. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis using the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty and Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data. The study included non-physician practitioners providing at least 25 independent evaluation and management services annually for Medicare beneficiaries between 2014 and 2021. Attrition rates, defined as the absence of emergency medicine clinical services in subsequent years, were stratified by gender, clinician type, and practice urbanicity. RESULTS: The emergency medicine non-physician practitioner workforce grew from 14,559 to 17,679 between 2014 and 2021. Women non-physician practitioners comprised 64.6% of the workforce, and rural non-physician practitioners accounted for 15.7%. Across study years, the weighted annual attrition rate was 13.8%, rising from 12.1% in 2014 to 17.6% in 2019. Attrition rates were higher among physician assistants as well as women and rural non-physician practitioners, with median ages at attrition of 40.2 years for women and 45.9 years for men, and 38.6 years for urban non-physician practitioners versus 43.6 years for rural non-physician practitioners. CONCLUSION: The rate of non-physician practitioner attrition from the emergency medicine workforce is considerably higher and occurs at younger ages than prior work evaluating emergency physician attrition, with similar identified gender and geographic disparities.

This study provides an update on recent trends in faculty promotion in U.S. medical schools. METHOD: Using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster, the authors examined trends in faculty promotion over 10 years. Promotion status for full-time assistant and full-time associate professors who started between 2000 and 2009 inclusive was followed from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2019. The authors used bivariate analyses to assess associations and promotion rates by sex, race/ethnicity, department, tenure status, and degree type. RESULTS: The promotion rate for assistant professors was 44.3% (2,330/5,263) in basic science departments, 37.1% (17,232/46,473) in clinical science departments, and 33.6% (131/390) in other departments. Among clinical departments, family medicine had the lowest rate of promoting assistant professors (24.4%; 484/1,982) and otolaryngology the highest rate (51.2%; 282/551). Faculty members who were male (38.9%; 11,687/30,017), White (40.0%; 12,635/31,596), tenured (58.7%; 98/167) or tenure-eligible (55.6%; 6,653/11,976), and holding MDs/PhDs (48.7%; 1,968/4,038) had higher promotion rates than, respectively, faculty who were female (36.3%; 7,975/21,998), minorities underrepresented in medicine (URM; 31.0%; 1,716/5,539), nontenured (32.5%; 12,174/37,433), and holding other/unknown degrees (20.6%; 195/948; all P < .001). These differences were less pronounced among associate professors; however, URM and nontenured faculty continued to have lower promotion rates compared with White, Asian, or tenured faculty at the associate professor level.

"Challenges in Recruiting, Retaining and Promoting Racially and Ethnically Diverse Faculty.",Kaplan SE; Gunn CM; Kulukulualani AK; Raj A; Freund KM; Carr PL,"BACKGROUND: Despite individual and institutional awareness of the inequity in retention, promotion and leadership of racially and ethnically underrepresented minority faculty in academic medicine, the number of such faculty remains unacceptably low. The authors explored challenges to the recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented faculty among a sample of leaders at academic medical centers. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted from 2011 to 2012 with 44 senior faculty leaders, predominantly members of the Group on Diversity and Inclusion (GDI) and/or the Group on Women in Medical Sciences (GWIMS), at the 24 randomly selected medical schools of the National Faculty Survey of 1995. All institutions were in the continental United States and balanced across public/private status and geographic region. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and organized into content areas before conducting inductive thematic analysis. Themes expressed by multiple informants were studied for patterns of association. RESULTS: The climate for underrepresented minority faculty was described as neutral to positive. Three consistent themes were identified regarding the challenges to recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented faculty: 1) the continued lack of a critical mass of minority faculty; 2) the need for coordinated programmatic efforts and resources necessary to address retention and promotion; and 3) the need for a senior leader champion.

National Orthopedic Residency Attrition: Who Is At Risk?,Bauer JM; Holt GE,"BACKGROUND: National U.S. orthopedic resident attrition rates have been historically low, but no literature exists as to the characteristics of those who leave nor the circumstance of the departure. We aimed to determine factors that may place a resident at higher risk for attrition. Additionally, we planned to determine whether the 2003-work hour restriction affected attrition rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All orthopedic surgery residency program directors in the United States were surveyed on demographic data for their current resident class, the number of residents who left the program, as well as demographic description for each of the residents who left their program from 1998 to 2013. Exclusion criteria included military programs and those younger than 3 years. All data were deidentified and compared to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource book to protect against sample error in respondents. RESULTS: Of 146 programs included, the overall response rate was 54% of residency directors, representing 51% of orthopedic residents. The respondent demographic make-up of 13.7% female, and average program size of 22.3 residents, compared similarly to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education national average of 13% female and 23-resident program size. Compared to all respondents, residents who left their program were more likely to be female (27%, p = 0.0018), single (51%, p = 0.0028), and without children (80%, p = 0.0018). There was no statistical difference based on minority status or 2003-instituted work hour restriction.

Analysis of national trends in neurosurgical resident attrition.,Agarwal N; White MD; Pannullo SC; Chambless LB,"OBJECTIVE: Resident attrition creates a profound burden on trainees and residency programs. This study aims to analyze trends in resident attrition in neurological surgery. METHODS: This study followed a cohort of 1275 residents who started neurosurgical residency from 2005 to 2010. Data obtained from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) included residents who matched in neurosurgery during this time. Residents who did not finish their residency training at the program in which they started were placed into the attrition group. Residents in the attrition group were characterized by one of five outcomes: transferred neurosurgery programs; transferred to a different specialty; left clinical medicine; deceased; or unknown. A thorough internet search was conducted for residents who did not complete their training at their first neurosurgical program. Variables leading to attrition were also analyzed, including age, sex, presence of advanced degree (Ph.D.), postgraduate year (PGY), and geographical region of program. RESULTS: Residents starting neurosurgical residency from 2005 to 2010 had an overall attrition rate of 10.98%. There was no statistically significant difference in attrition rates among the years (p = 0.337). The outcomes for residents in the attrition group were found to be as follows: 33.61% transferred neurosurgical programs, 56.30% transferred to a different medical specialty, 8.40% left clinical medicine, and 1.68% were deceased. It was observed that women had a higher attrition rate (18.50%) than men (10.35%). Most attrition (65.07%) occurred during PGY 1 or 2. The attrition group was also observed to be significantly older at the beginning of residency training, with a mean of 31.69 years of age compared to 29.31 in the nonattrition group (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in the attrition rates for residents with a Ph.D. (9.86%) compared to those without a Ph.D. (p = 0.472). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of residents in the attrition group pursued training in different medical specialties, most commonly neurology, radiology, and anesthesiology. Factors associated with an increased rate of attrition were older age at the beginning of residency, female sex, and junior resident (PGY-1 to PGY-2). Resident attrition remains a significant problem within neurosurgical training, and future studies should focus on targeted interventions to identify individuals at risk to help them succeed in their medical careers.",2019,Nov,J Neurosurg,131,5,1668-1673,,10.3171/2018.5.JNS18519,30497159,#671,Agarwal 2019,"",""
Zirconia Minimally Invasive Partial Retainer Fixed Dental Prostheses: Up To Ten Year Follow-Up.,Cândea A; Goguţă LM; Frandes M; Jivanescu A,"PURPOSE: To assess the survival rate of 3 mol % yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP) minimally invasive anterior and posterior single and double partial retainer fixed dental prostheses (PRFDPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients (18 women and 5 men, age range: 20 to 66 years) with single-tooth gaps received 28 3Y-TZP PRFDPs. Eight PRFDPs had two partial retainers and one pontic, two PRFDPs had two partial retainers and one pontic with a mesial cantilever, and 18 PRFDPs had one retainer and one cantilever. The abutment teeth were prepared following specific guidelines for all-ceramic restorations, considering existing direct restorations, carious processes, and occlusal conditions. The restorations were made of 3Y-TZP using CAD/CAM technology. Cementation was performed either conventionally, using resin-modified glass-ionomer (n = 6), or adhesively, using dual-polymerized resin cement (n = 22). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted. A P value of .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During the observation period (5.92 ± 1.74 years, minimum = 2 years, maximum = 10 years), three debondings occurred, all in the two-retainer group and the mandible. The survival rates for the two types of intervention were different, with 100% for a single retainer and 70% for a double retainer, but without a significant difference (log-rank test χ(2)(1) = 0.200, P = .655). CONCLUSION: The 3Y-TZP PRFDPs presented in this study showed no failure when bonded and not conventionally cemented. Therefore, they can be used in cases where implant therapy is not possible or indicated.",2021,November/December,Int J Prosthodont,34,6,724–732,,10.11607/ijp.7061,33662049,#673,Cândea 2021,"",""
Changes in haemoglobin and ferritin levels during basic combat training: relevance for attrition and injury frequency.,Taube F; Larsson I; Navren M; Ekblom Ö,"INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of the present study was to assess interindividual and intraindividual variations in haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations in Swedish recruits over 5 months of basic combat training (BCT). The secondary aim was to find predictors for missing training (a precursor for attrition) and overuse injuries during BCT. METHODS: In a cohort design, a total of 58 female and 104 male recruits provided complete data. We assessed the ferritin concentrations and haemoglobin concentrations at baseline and after 5 months of BCT and physical work capacity at baseline. RESULTS: During BCT, haemoglobin concentrations increased significantly in both females and males. Ferritin concentrations decreased significantly in both sexes and the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) (ie, ferritin levels <30 µg/L) increased significantly in females. The physical work capacity at baseline was related to the risk of missing training in fully adjusted models. In gender-adjusted analyses, baseline ferritin was related to the risk of overuse injury, but neither baseline nor change in iron status was related to injuries or risk of missing training when controlling for confounders. Body mass increased significantly in both genders, but we found no correlation between individual change in body mass and change in haemoglobin or ferritin nor was change in body mass related to the risk of overuse injury or missing training. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the prevalence of ID increased over the course of 5 months, while haemoglobin concentrations increased. As baseline physical work capacity was related to missing training, there are reasons to support preparatory physical training before BCT. These findings may inform future preventive interventions aimed at preventing detrimental effects of ID.",2024,Apr,BMJ Mil Health,,,,,10.1136/military-2023-002656,38688678,#675,Taube 2024,"",""
Geographical distance predicts psychiatric treatment retention for Hispanic women with comorbid major depression and breast cancer.,Chen Y; Markowitz JC; Blanco C; Hershman DL; Zhang JT; Hellerstein DJ,"PURPOSE: Depression is among the most common comorbid psychiatric disorders of patients with breast cancer. Depression decreases patient quality of life and, if untreated, can adversely affect cancer treatment. We sought to identify treatment barriers for women with breast cancer receiving psychotherapy for depression. Findings may help policy makers and researchers determine funding and design of future studies involving this population, especially in communities with high rates of health disparities. METHODS: We used data from a randomized trial for women with breast cancer and current DSM-IV non-psychotic unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of one of three psychotherapies and attrition was assessed by whether subjects completed 12 weekly treatment sessions. We used descriptive analyses and logistic regression to identify treatment barriers. R shiny was used to determine study patient residences. RESULTS: Of 134 randomized patients, 84 (62.7%) were Hispanic. Fifty-nine patients (44%) either did not start or dropped out of treatment, 49 (83.1%) of them being Hispanic. Being a Hispanic woman, less educated, and geographically distant from treatment significantly predicted attrition. Single Hispanic mothers had significantly higher attrition risk than married and/or childless women. CONCLUSION: Identifying barriers to treatment is important to improve treatment adherence for patients with concurrent diagnoses of breast cancer and MDD, especially for traditionally underserved minorities. Additional support such as affordable tele-medicine, multi-language assistance, financial aid for transportation and child-care, and allocation of more funds to address some identified barriers deserve consideration to improve treatment adherence and outcomes.",2024,Jun,Breast Cancer Res Treat,205,2,249-256,,10.1007/s10549-024-07250-9,38376796,#676,Chen 2024,"",""
A latent class analysis approach to the identification of doctoral students at risk of attrition.,Stevens SM; Ruberton PM; Smyth JM; Cohen GL; Purdie Greenaway V; Cook JE,"To advance understanding of doctoral student experiences and the high attrition rates among Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) doctoral students, we developed and examined the psychological profiles of different types of doctoral students. We used latent class analysis on self-reported psychological data relevant to psychological threat from 1,081 incoming doctoral students across three universities and found that the best-fitting model delineated four threat classes: Lowest Threat, Nonchalant, Engaged/Worried, and Highest Threat. These classes were associated with characteristics measured at the beginning of students' first semester of graduate school that may influence attrition risk, including differences in academic preparation (e.g., amount of research experience), self-evaluations and perceived fit (e.g., sense of belonging), attitudes towards graduate school and academia (e.g., strength of motivation), and interpersonal relations (e.g., perceived social support). Lowest Threat students tended to report the most positive characteristics and Highest Threat students the most negative characteristics, whereas the results for Nonchalant and Engaged/Worried students were more mixed. Ultimately, we suggest that Engaged/Worried and Highest Threat students are at relatively high risk of attrition. Moreover, the demographic distributions of profiles differed, with members of groups more likely to face social identity threat (e.g., women) being overrepresented in a higher threat profile (i.e., Engaged/Worried students) and underrepresented in lower threat profiles (i.e., Lowest Threat and Nonchalant students). We conclude that doctoral students meaningfully vary in their psychological threat at the beginning of graduate study and suggest that these differences may portend divergent outcomes.",2023,,PLoS One,18,1,e0280325,,10.1371/journal.pone.0280325,36638114,#677,Stevens 2023,"",""
"Unraveling Chylomicron Retention Disease Enhances Insight into SAR1B GTPase Functions and Mechanisms of Actions, While Shedding Light of Intracellular Chylomicron Trafficking.",Levy E; Fallet-Bianco C; Auclair N; Patey N; Marcil V; Sané AT; Spahis S,"Over the past three decades, significant efforts have been focused on unraveling congenital intestinal disorders that disrupt the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. The primary goal has been to gain deeper insights into intra-enterocyte sites, molecular steps, and crucial proteins/regulatory pathways involved, while simultaneously identifying novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. This research not only delves into specific and rare malabsorptive conditions, such as chylomicron retention disease (CRD), but also contributes to our understanding of normal physiology through the utilization of cutting-edge cellular and animal models alongside advanced research methodologies. This review elucidates how modern techniques have facilitated the decoding of CRD gene defects, the identification of dysfunctional cellular processes, disease regulatory mechanisms, and the essential role of coat protein complex II-coated vesicles and cargo receptors in chylomicron trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. Moreover, experimental approaches have shed light on the multifaceted functions of SAR1B GTPase, wherein loss-of-function mutations not only predispose individuals to CRD but also exacerbate oxidative stress, inflammation, and ER stress, potentially contributing to clinical complications associated with CRD. In addition to dissecting the primary disease pathology, genetically modified animal models have emerged as invaluable assets in exploring various ancillary aspects, including responses to environmental challenges such as dietary alterations, gender-specific disparities in disease onset and progression, and embryonic lethality or developmental abnormalities. In summary, this comprehensive review provides an in-depth and contemporary analysis of CRD, offering a meticulous examination of the CRD current landscape by synthesizing the latest research findings and advancements in the field.",2024,Jul,Biomedicines,12,7,,,10.3390/biomedicines12071548,39062121,#679,Levy 2024,"",""
Bone Mineral Density and Bone Turnover Marker in a Subclinical Thyrotoxic State in Young Premenopausal Women.,Lu C; Dharmalingam M; R MP; Y P G; Selvan C; Kalra P,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical thyrotoxicosis (SCH) is characterized by normal serum thyroid hormone levels and low thyrotropin levels. The impact of this condition on the skeletal system may vary depending on its cause, yet the relationship is not fully comprehended in premenopausal women. Studies are scarce about its effects on bone health in our population. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers in premenopausal women with SCH and determine if any differences exist based on the condition's etiology. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Ramaiah Medical College involving 36 participants for one year and six months after approval from the Ethics Committee. The carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen in blood and BMD were measured at the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4) and femoral neck by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Hologic v 2.0, Hologic, Massachusetts, U.S.). Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (Released 2011; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).  Results: The mean age of the study population was 35.2 ± 7.2 years. The etiology was Graves' disease [n=11 (33.3%)], iatrogenic [n=14(38.8%)], toxic adenoma [n=6 (15.1%)], and multi-nodular goiter [n=5 (15.1%)]. The mean BMI was 23.5 ± 3.8 kg/m(2), and the mean levels of corrected calcium, phosphorus, and 25 hydroxy-vitamin D were 9.12 ± 0.25 mg/dl, 2.95 ± 0.34 mg/dl, and 29.4 ± 6.4 ng/ml, respectively. The mean BMD at hip and spine was 0.81 ±0.16 g/cm(2) and 0.92±0.08 g/cm(2) respectively. The mean Z-score was (-0.02 ± 0.8) and (-0.92± 0.08) at the hip and spine. No significant difference was observed in the BMD at the hip (p = 0.14) or spine (p = 0.44) between the endogenous and exogenous subclinical thyrotoxic subgroups. At the same time, the carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen was significantly different between the two groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In our cross-sectional study of premenopausal women with SCH, BMD at the hip or spine as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry did not reveal any significant reduction. The subclinical thyrotoxic state may not have an adverse effect on bone health in premenopausal females with sufficient levels of serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in the short term.",2024,Jan,Cureus,16,1,e52610,,10.7759/cureus.52610,38374858,#681,Lu 2024,"",""
How does gestational weight gain influence short- and long-term postpartum weight retention?

Thirty-four observational studies were included, and results from 18 studies were combined in meta-analyses. We found that women with excessive GWG retained an additional 2.98 kg (95% CI: 0.59, 5.37 kg, I(2)  = 91%) at 0.5 years, 1.89 kg (95% CI: 0.90, 2.88 kg, I(2)  = 61%) at > 0.5-1 year and 2.89 kg (95% CI: 1.74, 4.04 kg, I (2)  = 0%) at 2-4 years, compared to women who met the National Academy of Medicine GWG recommendations. Moreover, synthesis of confounder-adjusted regression coefficients showed that each 1 kg increase of GWG corresponded to 0.62 kg (95% CI: 0.22, 1.02 kg, I(2)  = 96%) additional PPWR at 6-9 months, 0.48 kg (95% CI: 0.14, 0.81 kg, I(2)  = 93%) at 1-3 years, and 0.31 kg (95% CI: -0.24, 0.86 kg, I(2)  = 89%) at 5-7 years postpartum.

The Flipped Classroom Model: Exploring The Effect On The Knowledge Retention Of Medical Students.,Alnahdi M; Agha S; Khan MA; Almansour M,"BACKGROUND: In the Middle East, where most of the higher learning institutions still focus on the teacher-centred approach, implementation of this pedagogical model is an enormous task for educators. This study was designed to assess the role that the flipped classroom modality plays in the knowledge retention of medical students with a background in traditional methods of teaching and learning. METHODS: This study employed a mixed study design among a sample of 3rd year medical students (n=193) in the neurosciences course block. The students were divided into two groups: experimental and control. A post-test, a questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews as research instruments were used to collect data in this study. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant mean difference between the post-test scores in traditional (4.1±0.98) and flipped classroom (3.6±1.03) with a p-value=0.01, while no mean difference was found between male and female students (3.9±1.04, 3.9±1.02, p-value=0.77). The students appreciated the flipped classroom modality that helped with information sharing, interaction with peers and learning from others' experiences. Correspondingly, the four main characteristics of flipped classroom emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) positive perceptions of the flipped classroom, (2) challenges of the flipped classroom, (3) the effects of personal characteristics, and (4) lack of administration support. CONCLUSION: The performance of students was better in the traditional class than in the flipped classroom, particularly in the cognitive areas that deal with the interpretation and application of knowledge.

The Female Global Scholars Program: A mixed-methods evaluation of a novel intervention to promote the retention and advancement of women in global health research.,Cordeiro AA; Walsh KF; Sundararajan R; Reif LK; McNairy M; Mathad J; Downs JA; Fahme SA,"Fewer than 25% of global health leadership positions worldwide are held by women, adversely impacting women's health and widening gendered health disparities. The Female Global Scholars (FGS) Program, established in 2018 at Weill Cornell Medicine, is a two-year hybrid training and peer-mentorship program that promotes the retention and advancement of early-career female investigators conducting health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the FGS Program on individual career advancement, academic productivity, and research self-efficacy. This mixed-methods study followed an explanatory sequential design. Participants completed an electronic survey collecting information on demographics, academic milestones, and research skill competency. Survey data were descriptively analyzed using R (Version 1.4.1106). In-depth interviews explored perceptions of the impact of the FGS Program on career development. The authors independently reviewed and thematically analyzed de-identified transcripts using NVivo (Version 13). In June 2022, twelve participants completed the survey. The median age was 40 years; 90% carried an MD, PhD, or other post-graduate degree. Since joining the FGS Program, respondents achieved a combined total of eight awarded grants, five academic promotions, 12 oral scientific presentations and 35 first-author peer-reviewed publications. Thematic analysis identified four overarching themes: gaining confidence through mimicry; improved self-efficacy to address gendered challenges; real-world application of scientific and career development skills; and building multi-disciplinary communities in a protected female-only space.

Personal vision: enhancing work engagement and the retention of women in the engineering profession.,Buse KR; Bilimoria D,"This study examines how personal vision enhances work engagement and the retention of women in the engineering profession. Using a mixed method approach to understand the factors related to the retention of women in the engineering profession, we first interviewed women who persisted and women who opted out of the profession (Buse and Bilimoria, 2014). In these rich stories, we found that women who persisted had a personal vision that included their profession, and that this personal vision enabled them to overcome the bias, barriers and discrimination in the engineering workplace. To validate this finding on a larger population, we developed a scale to measure one's personal vision conceptualized as the ideal self (Boyatzis and Akrivou, 2006). The measure was tested in a pilot study and then used in a study of 495 women with engineering degrees. The findings validate that the ideal self is comprised of self-efficacy, hope, optimism and core identity. For these women, the ideal self directly impacts work engagement and work engagement directly impacts career commitment to engineering. The findings add to extant theory related to the role of personal vision and intentional change theory.

More than two-thirds were residing in sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV prevalence in the adult population (aged 15-49 years) was 3.9%. This population included 1.3 million pregnant women, of whom 82% had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission. In these countries, one challenge is an insufficient level of treatment adherence, particularly in HIV-positive pregnant women. Among the causes, the lack of involvement from a male partner is a significant contributor to the problem. This issue has strongly emerged in Malawi, one of the countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world: 9.2% of its adult population were living with HIV in 2018. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess 3 interventions that are aimed at improving ART adherence and retention among HIV-positive women through engagement with their male partners in 4 Malawian health care centers. METHODS: The prospective, controlled before-and-after study is conducted in 3 phases (total duration: 24 months): preintervention, intervention, and postintervention analyses. The number of selected clusters (clinical centers) is limited to 4: one for each intervention, plus a cluster where no intervention is performed (control arm). The interventions are as follows: opening the facility on one Saturday per month only for men, defined as a special day; testing peer-to-peer counseling among men, male champions; and providing a noneconomic incentive to all women who are accompanied by their partners to the facility, nudge. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the differences in retention in care and adherence to therapeutic protocols among women; the intermediate outcome is the assessment of differences in male involvement. The level of male involvement in the health of their partners (intermediate outcome) will be evaluated through a dedicated questionnaire administered at baseline and in the postintervention phase. Data will be collected at the clinical centers and stored in 2 electronic databases managed using 2 different types of software. RESULTS: The analysis of data collected in the 4 centers during the preintervention phase is ongoing, as enrollment ended on March 31, 2020. The total number of patients enrolled was 452 (Namandanje: 133; Kapeni: 78; Kapire: 75; and Balaka: 166). Meanwhile, several meetings have been conducted to organize the intervention phase. CONCLUSIONS: The study will identify the best intervention that enhances the involvement of male partners in women's health, using an approach that considers a broad spectrum of behaviors. An important aspect is the use of educational tools focused on messages, thereby initiating a reflective discussion of stereotypes and false beliefs related to the idea of masculinity present in the Malawian culture.

Marginal bone loss around cement and screw-retained fixed implant prosthesis.,Hameed MH; Khan FR; Ghafoor R; Azam SI,"BACKGROUND: Implant-supported fixed restorations are considered as the standard treatment for replacement of missing teeth. These can be either screw or cement retained. The success or failure of implant restorations depend upon amount of marginal bone loss (MBL). The present study is to determine the MBL around cement and screw-retained implant prosthesis and to determine various predictors of the MBL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective charts review was conducted at the dental clinics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi from February 2017 to June 2017 in which 104 implants restorations were assessed using periapical radiographs.

Sexual dimorphism and rapid turnover in gene expression in pre-reproductive seedlings of a dioecious herb.,Cossard GG; Toups MA; Pannell JR,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology or life history traits is common in dioecious plants at reproductive maturity, but it is typically inconspicuous or absent in juveniles. Although plants of different sexes probably begin to diverge in gene expression both before their reproduction commences and before dimorphism becomes readily apparent, to our knowledge transcriptome-wide differential gene expression has yet to be demonstrated for any angiosperm species. METHODS: The present study documents differences in gene expression in both above- and below-ground tissues of early pre-reproductive individuals of the wind-pollinated dioecious annual herb, Mercurialis annua, which otherwise shows clear sexual dimorphism only at the adult stage. KEY RESULTS: Whereas males and females differed in their gene expression at the first leaf stage, sex-biased gene expression peaked just prior to, and after, flowering, as might be expected if sexual dimorphism is partly a response to differential costs of reproduction. Sex-biased genes were over-represented among putative sex-linked genes in M. annua but showed no evidence for more rapid evolution than unbiased genes. CONCLUSIONS: Sex-biased gene expression in M. annua occurs as early as the first whorl of leaves is produced, is highly dynamic during plant development and varies substantially between vegetative tissues.",2019,Jul,Ann Bot,123,7,1119-1131,,10.1093/aob/mcy183,30289430,#689,Cossard 2019,"",""

Posttraining Knowledge Retention among Licensed Cupping Providers in Saudi Arabia.,Khalil MKM; El-Olemy AT; Aboushanab TS; AlMudaiheem A; Hussein AA; AlSanad S,"BACKGROUND: One of the licensing requirements for cupping providers in Saudi Arabia is to attend a compulsory training course that lasts 5 days for non-physicians and 4 days for physicians, irrespective of any previous experience in cupping therapy. The course is conducted by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM/MOH). As a part of course auditing, the current study aimed to evaluate knowledge retention among licensed cupping providers 1-3 years after passing the official cupping course. METHODS: Licensed cupping providers were invited to attend a continuing medical education activity. Sixty-two attended the continuing medical education activity. Before the event, participants were asked to answer 35 multiple-choice questions taken from the same data bank as the pretest and posttest of the course. The test scores were linked and compared with the pre- and posttest of the training course. RESULTS: A paired t test showed significant differences between the pre- and posttest knowledge scores (mean difference: 224.6 ± 86, p = 0.0001) and between the posttest and follow-up knowledge scores (mean difference: -115.26 ± 103.9, p = 0.0001). The follow-up score was still significantly higher than the pretest score, with a mean difference of 112 (95% CI: 83.66-140.34, p = 0.0001). There was no significant effect of category (physician vs. non-physician) on knowledge retention after controlling for the postcourse score. Gender, the total duration of experience, and total years of experience in cupping did not affect knowledge score retention between the physicians and the non-physicians. CONCLUSION: The official cupping training course of the NCCAM/MOH achieved reasonable knowledge retention. To achieve long-term knowledge retention, refresher training/courses and continuous professional development will be required.",2019,,Complement Med Res,26,5,329-335,,10.1159/000497357,30943523,#691,KhalilMKM 2019,"",""
"Retention of health care workers at health facility, trends in the retention of knowledge and correlates at 3rd year following training of health care workers on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV-National Assessment.",Kufe NC; Metekoua C; Nelly M; Tumasang F; Mbu ER,"BACKGROUND: Knowledgeable Health Care Workers (HCWs) are indispensable for the proper management of clients. We investigated retention of HCWs at health facility and retention of knowledge at 18, 24 and 36 months after training and correlates for retention of knowledge at 3rd year. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1000 HCWs, 710 were trained and 290 untrained working at the PMTCT of HIV services in health facilities of the ten regions of Cameroon. A Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) on HIV management with focus on PMTCT of HIV was used to assess retention of HCWs at the health facility and retention of knowledge. Summary statistics described mean scores for retention of HCWs and retention of knowledge. One-way Analysis of Variance summarized the differences in retention of knowledge over time after training. Correlates for retention of knowledge were investigated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The retention of HCWs at health facilities in PMTCT of HIV services was 85%. Trained HCWs had higher mean scores for retention of knowledge than untrained HCWs, p < 0.001. Knowledge attrition was observed from 18, 24 to 36 months following training. Differences in the mean scores for retention of knowledge were observed between state-owned with private and confessionary health facilities but not among trained HCWs at 18, 24 or 36 months. Highest mean scores for retention of knowledge were observed in District Hospitals, Sub-Divisional Hospitals, and Integrated Health Centres. Correlates for retention of knowledge were: gender, type of health facility, location, longevity at PMTCT services, trained others and had means to apply what was trained to do. CONCLUSION: Retention of trained HCWs at health facilities was high, mean scores for retention of knowledge was average and knowledge attrition was observed over time.

"Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine Product, QiangGuYin, on Bone Mineral Density and Bone Turnover in Chinese Postmenopausal Osteoporosis.",Shi ZY; Zhang XG; Li CW; Liu K; Liang BC; Shi XL,"Introduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of herbal formula QiangGuYin (QGY) in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods. A total of 240 participants from six clinical centers were randomly to receive alendronate 70 mg/week, QGY granules 20 g/day, and placebo. Primary end points were BMD changes over 6 and 12 months; secondary end points were bone turnover markers changes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Safety was monitored by clinical adverse events reported during the follow-up. Results. Of 240 women recruited, 218 completed the study. Significant BMD increases from baseline were observed over 6 and 12 months at each observed part both in QGY and alendronate compared with placebo (p < 0.01). Alendronate-treated subjects had significant decreases in β-CTX compared to QGY-treated subjects at each time point assessed (p < 0.01). Reduction in t-P1NP was only observed in the QGY group at 3 and 6 months (-23.81% and -3.07%, resp.). No significant difference was observed in the overall incidence of clinical adverse events among the alendronate group and the QGY group (5.0% versus 7.5%, p = 0.513). Conclusion. 1-Year treatment with QGY demonstrated a safe statistical increase in BMD and new balance may be rebuilt after 9 months.

Real-World Strategies to Engage and Retain Racial-Ethnic Minority Young Men Who Have Sex with Men in HIV Prevention Services.,Freese TE; Padwa H; Oeser BT; Rutkowski BA; Schulte MT,"Racial/ethnic minority young men who have sex with men (YMSM)-particularly African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos-are at particularly high risk for HIV infection. Devising strategies to improve engagement and retention in HIV prevention services among minority YMSM is critical if the United States is going to achieve the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goal of reducing HIV health-related disparities. This article presents findings from a national summit on racial/ethnic YMSM services convened by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-funded Center of Excellence on Racial and Ethnic Minority Young Men Who Have Sex with Men and Other Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Populations (YMSM + LGBT CoE) in September 2015. The summit included (1) subgroup discussions focused on issues related to treatment access, outreach/engagement/retention, continuing care/recovery support, and health literacy for minority YMSM; and (2) a ranking process, where the NIATx Nominal Group Technique was used to identify the strategies and approaches that summit participants believed to be most promising for engaging and retaining minority YMSM in HIV prevention services. Analyses of results from summit activities highlight four key cross-cutting strategies-utilizing peers, providing holistic care, making services fun, and utilizing technology-as critical for engaging minority YMSM in HIV prevention care. Examples of programs that utilize these strategies and implications of these findings for policy and practice are discussed.",2017,Jun,AIDS Patient Care STDS,31,6,275-281,,10.1089/apc.2016.0310,28530444,#694,Freese 2017,"",""
Bone turnover markers for assessment of anti-resorptive effect in clinical practice: A good idea meets the problem of measurement uncertainty.,Kline GA; Holmes DT,"OBJECTIVES: Bone turnover markers (BTM) are measures for understanding the effect of anti-resorptives upon osteoclast activity. Post-hoc trial data suggests reduction in BTM of 40% may represent a target for defining appropriate response to therapy. We modeled clinical application of this target threshold in an individual patient setting where assay measurement uncertainty and biological variation are included. DESIGN: Using serum C-telo-peptide (ß-CTX), we constructed hypothetical scenarios of ß-CTX measurement pre and post bisphosphonate therapy. Using typical ß-CTX assay characteristics (analytical coefficient of variation, CV 5.0%) and published intra-individual ß-CTX data for post-menopausal women (CV 18.0%), we calculated the post-therapy ß-CTX that must be seen on single repeat measure for 95% confidence that the observed result was ≥40% below baseline. Sensitivity analyses considered greater and lesser variations in the combined sources of variation. RESULTS: The one-tailed 95% reference change value for any detectable therapeutic decrease in ß-CTX was 22%. However, to have 95% confidence of having achieved a reduction ≥40%, an observed ß-CTX decrease of ≥56% is required. Larger decreases are needed for scenarios of greater analytical or intra-individual variation. CONCLUSIONS: Although population data suggest a ß-CTX decrease of 40% is commensurate with adequate therapeutic response to anti-resorptives, application to an individual patient where measurement and natural variation are present is problematic. ß-CTX decreases much >40% are required to be confident of having achieved the optimal treatment response. It is uncertain whether this is a legitimate change to be expected in all individual patients and therefore clinical application of this threshold is uncertain.",2023,Jun,Clin Biochem,116,,100-104,,10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2023.04.007,37084998,#695,Kline 2023,"",""
The Common Retention Practices Among Orthodontists from Different Countries.,Almuzian M; Mheissen S; Khan H; Alharbi F; Alzoubi EE; Wertheimer MB,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the most common retention practices, factors influencing the retention protocol, and the differences among orthodontists regarding retention practices. METHODS: An online validated questionnaire was anonymously sent to 3,000 orthodontic residents and clinicians. The survey consisted of 19 questions regarding the participants' demographics, prescribed retention appliances, factors affecting retention appliance choices, and adjunctive retention procedures. Descriptive statistics, Chi2 and Kendall's Tau-b tests were applied. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-five orthodontic residents and clinicians, 53.3% males and 46.7% females, completed the survey, indicating a response rate of 18.5%. Although participants' demographics, type of treatment and pre-treatment malocclusion influence the choice of retention protocols, thermoplastic retainers (TR) were the most popular retention regime for the maxillary arch for both adults (47.4%) and adolescents (42.3%). Bonded retainers (BR) were the favored option for the mandibular arch (44.9% of adults and 40.7% of adolescents). The degree of arch expansion (64.1%) and the degree of interdigitation (50.1%) after treatment were the most influential factors for the choice of the preferred type of retainers by the respondents. 68.6% of the participants thought professional retention guidelines would be useful. CONCLUSION: Thermoplastic retainers were the most common retention appliances for adults and adolescents in the maxilla. At the same time, BR was the most favored retainer in the mandibular arch, with clinical experience, practice setting, and malocclusion- and treatment-related factors influencing the type of the chosen appliance.

Prospective T1 mapping to assess gadolinium retention in brain after intrathecal gadobutrol.,Ringstad G; Valnes LM; Vatnehol SAS; Pripp AH; Eide PK,"PURPOSE: A possible pathway behind gadolinium retention in brain is leakage of contrast agents from blood to cerebrospinal fluid and entry into brain along perivascular (glymphatic) pathways. The object of this study was to assess for signs of gadolinium retention in brain 4 weeks after intrathecal contrast enhanced MRI. METHODS: We prospectively applied standardized T1 mapping of the brain before and 4 weeks after intrathecal administration of 0.5 mmol gadobutrol in patients under work-up of cerebrospinal fluid circulation disorders. Due to methodological limitations, a safety margin for percentage change in T1 time was set to 3%. Region-wise differences were assessed by pairwise comparison using t-tests and forest plots, and statistical significance was accepted at .05 level (two-tailed). RESULTS: In a cohort of 76 participants (mean age 47.2 years ± 17.9 [standard deviation], 47 women), T1 relaxation times remained unchanged in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia 4 weeks after intrathecal gadobutrol. T1 was reduced from 1082 ± 46.7 ms to 1070.6 ± 36.5 ms (0.98 ±2.9%) (mean [standard deviation]) (p=0.001) in white matter, thus within the pre-defined 3% safety margin. The brain stem and cerebellum could not be assessed due to poor alignment of posterior fossa structures at scans from different time points.

This study explores Australian males' experiences as dietitians in the Australian workforce, with the aim to identify influences that initially attracted them to dietetics, as well as barriers that may affect their decision to stay in or leave the profession. METHODS: A cross-sectional, semi-quantitative web-based survey was distributed to male dietitians using purposive, snowball sampling. Closed and open-ended questions were included. Descriptive statistics were generated, and content analysis of free-text responses identified major themes. RESULTS: Seventy-one respondents opened the survey link, of which 65 respondents attempted the survey. Fifty-four (83.1%) respondents agreed that dietetics is female-dominated. An interest in food and nutrition was the most reported reason for studying dietetics (73.8%). Of the 55 respondents who were not intending to retire in the next 5 years, 15 (27.3%) stated they were somewhat or extremely likely to leave the profession of dietetics. Respondents identified issues that impacted their experiences as a male dietitian, including gender differences, a lack of male role models, barriers to career progression/employment, and perceptions of a lack of respect and impact within healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Australian male dietitians perceive systemic, social, and personal factors that have influenced their career experiences. Greater exposure to prominent male role models may be self-perpetuating in improving male dietitian recruitment and eventually, retention.

Derivation and Evaluation of a Risk-Scoring Tool to Predict Participant Attrition in a Lifestyle Intervention Project.,Jiang L; Yang J; Huang H; Johnson A; Dill EJ; Beals J; Manson SM; Roubideaux Y,"Participant attrition in clinical trials and community-based interventions is a serious, common, and costly problem. In order to develop a simple predictive scoring system that can quantify the risk of participant attrition in a lifestyle intervention project, we analyzed data from the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPI-DP), an evidence-based lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes in 36 American Indian and Alaska Native communities. SDPI-DP participants were randomly divided into a derivation cohort (n = 1600) and a validation cohort (n = 801). Logistic regressions were used to develop a scoring system from the derivation cohort. The discriminatory power and calibration properties of the system were assessed using the validation cohort. Seven independent factors predicted program attrition: gender, age, household income, comorbidity, chronic pain, site's user population size, and average age of site staff. Six factors predicted long-term attrition: gender, age, marital status, chronic pain, site's user population size, and average age of site staff. Each model exhibited moderate to fair discriminatory power (C statistic in the validation set: 0.70 for program attrition, and 0.66 for long-term attrition) and excellent calibration. The resulting scoring system offers a low-technology approach to identify participants at elevated risk for attrition in future similar behavioral modification intervention projects, which may inform appropriate allocation of retention resources. This approach also serves as a model for other efforts to prevent participant attrition.",2016,May,Prev Sci,17,4,461-71,,10.1007/s11121-015-0628-x,26768431,#699,Jiang 2016,"",""

"Retain rural doctors: Burnout, depression and anxiety in medical doctors working in rural KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.",Hain S; Tomita A; Milligan P; Chiliza B,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to retain medical doctors in rural areas to ensure equitable access to healthcare for rural communities. Burnout, depression and anxiety may contribute to difficulty in retaining doctors. Some studies have found high rates of these conditions in medical doctors in general, but there is little research available on their prevalence among those working in the rural areas of South Africa (SA). OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of burnout, depression and anxiety in doctors working in rural district hospitals in northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, SA, and to explore the associated sociodemographic and rural work-related factors. METHODS: We performed a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional study in three districts in northern KZN among medical doctors working at 15 rural district hospitals during August and September 2020. The prevalences of burnout, depression and anxiety were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire, respectively. The sociodemographic and rural occupational profiles were assessed using a questionnaire designed by the authors. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Of 96 doctors who participated in the study, 47.3% (n=44) were aged between 24 and 29 years and 70.8% (n=68) had worked in a rural setting for &lt;5 years. Of the participants, 68.5% (n=61) were considered to have burnout. The screening tests for depression and anxiety were positive for 35.6% (n=31) and 23.3% (n=20) of participants, respectively. Burnout alone was significantly associated with female gender (84.8%; n=39) (χ2=11.65, df=1, p=0.01). Burnout (χ2=8.14, df=3, p=0.04) and anxiety (χ2=12.96, df=3, p&lt;0.01) were both significantly associated with occupational rank, with 85.2% (n=23) of community service medical officers (CSMOs) reporting the former and 29.6% (n=8) screening positive for generalised anxiety disorder. Burnout (χ2=7.61, df=1, p=0.01), depression (χ2=5.49, df=1, p=0.02) and anxiety (χ2=4.08, df=1, p=0.04) were all shown to be significantly associated with doctors planning to leave the public sector in the next 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found high rates of burnout, depression and anxiety in rural doctors in northern KZN, all of which were associated with the intention to leave the public sector in the next 2 years.

Strategies for recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for a clinical trial.,Huang B; De Vore D; Chirinos C; Wolf J; Low D; Willard-Grace R; Tsao S; Garvey C; Donesky D; Su G; Thom DH,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment and retention are two significant barriers in research, particularly for historically underrepresented groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, patients who are low-income, or people with substance use or mental health issues. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death and disproportionately affects many underrepresented groups. The lack of representation of these groups in research limits the generalizability and applicability of clinical research and results. In this paper we describe our experience and rates of recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups for the Aides in Respiration (AIR) COPD Health Coaching Study. METHODS: A priori design strategies included minimizing exclusion criteria, including patients in the study process, establishing partnerships with the community clinics, and ensuring that the health coaching intervention was flexible enough to accommodate patient needs. RESULTS: Challenges to recruitment included lack of spirometric data in patient records, space constraints at the clinic sites, barriers to patient access to clinic sites, lack of current patient contact information and poor patient health. Of 282 patients identified as eligible, 192 (68%) were enrolled in the study and 158 (82%) completed the study. Race, gender, educational attainment, severity of disease, health literacy, and clinic site were not associated with recruitment or retention. However, older patients were less likely to enroll in the study and patients who used home oxygen or had more than one hospitalization during the study period were less likely to complete the study. Three key strategies to maximize recruitment and retention were identified during the study: incorporating the patient perspective, partnering with the community clinics, and building patient rapport. CONCLUSIONS: While the AIR study included design features to maximize the recruitment and retention of patients from underrepresented groups, additional challenges were encountered and responded to during the study. We also identified three key strategies recommended for future studies of COPD and similar conditions. Incorporating the approaches described into future studies may increase participation rates from underrepresented groups, providing results that can be more accurately applied to patients who carry a disparate burden of disease.

Interventions including a nutrition component aimed at managing gestational weight gain or postpartum weight retention: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Vincze L; Rollo M; Hutchesson M; Hauck Y; MacDonald-Wicks L; Wood L; Callister R; Collins C,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that include a nutrition component aimed at improving gestational weight gain and/or postpartum weight retention. INTRODUCTION: Excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention increase the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Current evidence comprises many interventions targeting gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that incorporate a nutrition component. To date, no review has synthesized evidence from pregnancy through the postpartum period or described the intervention approaches in detail. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The review included women (≥18 years) during pregnancy and/or up to 12 months postpartum. Studies were included if they involved a weight management intervention with a nutrition component and had the primary objective of determining the impact of gestational weight gain and/or postpartum weight change. Interventions were compared to usual care (i.e. control conditions with no intervention or wait-list control or standard pregnancy or postpartum care) or ""other"" (alternative intervention). The review considered randomized controlled trials published between 1980 and January 21, 2016. Studies that included a weight related primary outcome measured during pregnancy and/or postpartum were included. METHODS: Seven databases were searched and the reference lists of included studies were searched for additional studies not previously identified. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI SUMARI). The JBI SUMARI standardized data extraction tool was used to extract data. A narrative synthesis was undertaken to qualitatively synthesize included studies, with meta-analyses used to pool weight outcome data from studies conducted separately for pregnancy and postpartum. Effect sizes for meta-analyses have been expressed as weighted mean differences (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: The search yielded 4063 articles of which 48 articles from 39 studies were included. Eleven of 20 studies during pregnancy reported significant reductions in gestational weight gain with the intervention when compared to control groups. One of five studies where the intervention was conducted during both pregnancy and postpartum reported statistically significant reductions in gestational weight gain, and postpartum weight retention between intervention and control groups. Nine of 14 studies conducted after childbirth reported statistically significant intervention effects, indicating lesser postpartum weight retention. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that despite considerable heterogeneity, interventions conducted during pregnancy (-1.25 kg; 95% CI: -2.10 kg, -0.40 kg; p = 0.004), and postpartum (-3.25 kg; 95% CI: -4.69 kg, -1.82 kg; p < 0.001) were significantly more effective at improving weight outcomes compared to usual care or other interventions. Most studies were of moderate quality due to lack of clarity in describing study details required for appraising methodological quality. Few interventions were conducted from pregnancy through the postpartum period (n = 5). Limited interventions adopted online modalities in intervention delivery (n = 4). Intention-to-treat analysis was used in only 12 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy and postpartum period presents a unique opportunity to engage women in interventions to help optimize lifestyle behaviors for weight management, however the optimal approach is unclear.

"Evaluating the association between urine drug screening frequency and retention in opioid agonist treatment in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective cohort study.",Morin KA; Dabous JR; Vojtesek F; Marsh D,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate how urine drug screening (UDS) frequency is associated with retention in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study of 55 921 adults in OAT in Ontario, Canada, were derived from administrative sources between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015. All patient information was linked anonymously across databases using encrypted health card numbers. Descriptive statistics were calculated for comparing UDS frequency groups using standardised differences (d) where d less than 10% indicated a statistically significant difference. A logistic regression model was then used to calculate ORs adjusting for baseline covariates, including sex, age, location of residence, income quintile, mental disorders, HIV status and deep tissue infections. RESULTS: Over 70% of the cohort had four or more UDS tests per month (weekly or more UDS). Significant associations were observed between UDS frequency and 1-year treatment retention in OAT biweekly (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.20, 95% CI 2.75 to 3.75); weekly UDS (aOR=6.86, 95% CI 5.88 to 8.00) and more than weekly (aOR=8.03, 95% CI 6.87 to 9.38) using the monthly or less groups as the reference. CONCLUSION: This study identified an association between weekly UDS and 1-year treatment retention in OAT. There is an active discussion within Canada about the utility of UDS. The lack of evidence for the impact of UDS on retention has left it open to some to argue they simply provide a barrier to patient engagement.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation will be conducted from the provider perspective as a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of the cash transfer programme compared with the status quo. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be presented along with a cost-consequence analysis where the incremental costs and all statistically significant outcomes will be listed separately. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore uncertainty and to ensure that results are robust. A fiscal space assessment will explore the affordability of the intervention. In addition, an analysis of equity impact of the intervention will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethics approval from the Maseno University Ethics Review Committee, REF MSU/DRPI/MUERC/00294/16. The results of the economic evaluation will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a relevant international conference.

"The relationship between organisational support for career development, organisational commitment, and turnover intentions among healthcare workers in township hospitals of Henan, China.",Wu H; Liu Y,"BACKGROUND: Township hospitals in China face the challenge of shortage and turnover of healthcare workers. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between organisational support for career development (OSCD), organisational commitment, and turnover intentions among healthcare workers in township hospitals. METHODS: The data in this study were obtained from the Health Service Capacity Survey of Primary Health Institutions (2020), one of the special surveys of rural health poverty alleviation in Henan, China. The sample comprised 298 healthcare workers. Three standardised instruments were used: the turnover intention scale, OSCD scale, and organisational commitment scale. Descriptive statistics, One-way Analysis of Variance, Pearson correlation analysis, and the simple mediation model were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the mean score of the healthcare workers' turnover intentions was 2.21 ± 0.77, which was low. The healthcare workers' turnover intentions had significant differences in gender, age, marital status, education, professional title, and organisational tenure. OSCD had no significant direct relationship with turnover intentions, while having a significant positive direct relationship with organisational commitment. Organisational commitment had a significant negative direct relationship with turnover intentions, and played a fully mediating role in the relationship between OSCD and turnover intentions. CONCLUSIONS: OSCD had an indirect negative effect on healthcare workers' turnover intentions in township hospitals through the full mediation of organisational commitment. The findings of this study suggest the importance of policymakers and organisation managers to improve OSCD practice and pay attention to 'humanistic management'. In addition, the formulation and implementation of talent retention policies should consider socio-demographic differences.",2022,Jun,BMC Prim Care,23,1,136,,10.1186/s12875-022-01753-4,35655133,#707,Wu 2022,"",""
Adult thymic epithelium contains nonsenescent label-retaining cells.,Dumont-Lagacé M; Brochu S; St-Pierre C; Perreault C,"Progress in our understanding of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) renewal and homeostasis is hindered by the lack of markers for TEC progenitors. Stem and progenitor cell populations display remarkable diversity in their proliferative behavior. In some but not all tissues, stemness is associated with quiescence. The primary goal of our study was to discover whether quiescent cells were present in neonatal and adult TECs. To this end, we used a transgenic label-retaining cell (LRC) assay in which a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein is expressed under the control of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator and the tetracycline operator minimal promoter. In adult mice, we found that both cortical and medullary TECs (cTECs and mTECs) proliferated more actively in females than males. Moreover, we observed three main differences between neonatal and adult TECs: 1) neonatal TECs proliferated more actively than adult TECs; 2) whereas cTECs and mTECs had similar turnover rates in young mice, the turnover of mTECs was more rapid than that of cTECs in adults; and 3) although no LRCs could be detected in young mice, LRCs were detectable after a 16-wk chase in adults. In female mice, LRCs were found almost exclusively among cTECs and expressed relatively low levels of p16INK4a, p19ARF, and Serpine1, and high levels of Bmi1, Foxn1, Trp63, and Wnt4. We conclude that LRCs in adult TECs are not senescent postmitotic cells and may represent the elusive progenitors responsible for TEC maintenance in the adult thymus.",2014,Mar,J Immunol,192,5,2219-26,,10.4049/jimmunol.1302961,24477909,#708,Dumont-Lagacé 2014,"",""
An interactive mobile application versus an educational booklet to promote job retention in women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.,Blinder VS; Patil S; Finik J; Makower D; Muppidi M; Lichtenthal WG; Parker PA; Claros M; Suarez J; Narang B; Gany F,"BACKGROUND: Job loss after a cancer diagnosis can lead to long-term financial toxicity and its attendant adverse clinical consequences, including decreased treatment adherence. Among women undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, access to work accommodations (e.g., sick leave) is associated with higher job retention after treatment completion. However, low-income and/or minority women are less likely to have access to work accommodations and, therefore, are at higher risk of job loss. Given the time and transportation barriers that low-income working patients commonly face, it is crucial to develop an intervention that is convenient and easy to use. METHODS: We designed an intervention to promote job retention during and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer by improving access to relevant accommodations. Talking to Employers And Medical staff about Work (TEAMWork) is an English/Spanish mobile application (app) that provides (1) suggestions for work accommodations tailored to specific job demands, (2) coaching/strategies for negotiating with an employer, (3) advice for symptom self-management, and (4) tools to improve communication with the medical oncology team. This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the app as a job-retention tool compared to a control condition that provides the app content in an informational paper booklet. The primary outcome of the study is work status after treatment completion. Secondary outcomes include work status 1 and 2 years later, participant self-efficacy to ask an employer for accommodations, receipt of workplace accommodations during and following adjuvant therapy, patient self-efficacy to communicate with the oncology provider, self-reported symptom burden during and following adjuvant therapy, and cancer treatment adherence. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the use of mobile technology to improve vulnerable breast cancer patients' ability to communicate with their employers and oncology providers, work during treatment and retain their jobs in the long term, thereby diminishing the potential consequences of job loss, including decreased treatment adherence, debt, and bankruptcy.

"Factors influencing utilisation of services provided by community midwives and their non-retention in district Thatta, Pakistan: a qualitative study protocol.",Khowaja BMH; Shahil Feroz A; Saleem S,"INTRODUCTION: Drawing on the well-acknowledged evidence of community midwives services to address the issue of high maternal mortality, the Government of Pakistan initiated the Community Midwifery (CMW) programme in 2006 to provide skilled birth attendance to pregnant women living in rural areas. Despite a large investment in CMW programme, the availability of community midwives in rural areas following their training is a constant struggle. The concerns related to the training, support and acceptability of community midwives need to be studied in order to identify gaps in the provision of skilled maternal and newborn healthcare. Therefore, this study aims to explore factors influencing the utilisation of services provided by community midwives and their non-retention in district Thatta, Pakistan. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will use a qualitative exploratory research design. The data will be collected through semistructured interviews and an approach of purposive sampling for the selection of participants for interviews. The study will be conducted in one of the rural districts Thatta of Province Sindh, Pakistan. The data will be collected through key informant interviews (KIIs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs). The KIIs will be conducted with officials of the health department (Thatta), the provincial maternal and newborn child health programme, and the Midwifery Association of Pakistan. The IDIs will be conducted with midwifery students, community midwives working and not working in the district, and community women of district Thatta. Data will be analysed through qualitative data analysis software NVivo V.10 and the thematic analysis approach.

Cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty in severe varus osteoarthritis knee: A match-pair comparative study in an Asian population.,Soong J; Ou Yang Y; Ling ZM; Chia SL; Lo NN; Yeo SJ,"BackgroundPosterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is advocated in severe varus osteoarthritic (OA) knees as the posterior cruciate ligament posed challenges in gap balancing. However, there is scarcity in the literature to illustrate the superiority of PS TKA over cruciate retaining (CR) TKA. Our study aims to compare the outcomes between CR and PS TKAs in patients with severe varus OA knees. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent primary TKA for OA knee from 2003 to 2013. Patients with OA knees of varus tibiofemoral angle ≥15 were matched into two groups (Group CR and PS) according to age, gender, and body mass index and compared in terms of clinical (tibiofemoral alignment, range of motion, and revision rate) and functional outcome (Knee Society Scoring, Oxford Knee Score, Short Form-36 Health Survey). Results: Both Group CR (n = 56) and PS (n = 56) had similar pre-operative scores. Both groups achieved correction of tibiofemoral alignment from median pre-operative varus of 17.6/17.0 (CR/PS) (p = .279) to median post-operative valgus of 4.9/4.0 (CR/PS) (p = .408). Over 24 months, both groups were comparable in achieving significant improvement in clinical and functional outcomes. No case of revision surgery was reported (median follow-up months; CR: 65, PS: 74, p = .549).

Autism-Related Cc2d1a Heterozygous Mice: Increased Levels of miRNAs Retained in DNA/RNA Hybrid Profiles (R-Loop).,Sener EF; Dana H; Tahtasakal R; Taheri S; Rassoulzadegan M,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a highly variable expression of phenotypes (restricted interest or activity and repetitive behavior in communication and social interactions), genes (mutation), markers (alteration of transcription) and pathways. Loss of function of the CC2D1A gene appears to primarily affect the brain, leading to a range of behavioral problems in humans. In our study published in 2020, we found that the expressions of miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-126-3p and miR-499a-5p were downregulated in the serum samples of autistic patients, their families and mouse models (Cc2d1a +/- and valproic acid treated males). Here, acquired non-Mendelian hereditary character in a genetically defined mouse model of autism (Cc2d1a +/-) correlates with the transcriptional alteration of five miRNAs. We seek to test the hypothesis that miRNA levels vary by changes in RNA/DNA structure during development, thereby creating transcription alteration and cell memory. Behavioral tests were conducted on the offspring of Cc2d1a (+/-) mutant and control mice, such as novel object, social interaction, marble burying and tail suspension behavior. Two RNA fractions were isolated from mouse hippocampal tissues and sperm cells via standard TRIzol extraction: free RNA and the fraction of RNA bound to DNA in the form of a DNA/RNA hybrid (R-loop). The expression levels of miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p and miR-499a-5p were investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We report differences in the distribution of five miRNAs in the hippocampus between male and female mice, particularly in colonies of Cc2d1a (+/-) mice. Furthermore, the number of miRNAs engaged in the DNA/RNA hybrid fraction is generally higher in the mutant pedigree than in the control group. On the other hand, in sperm, both fractions are at lower levels than in controls. R-loops contribute to the physiology and pathology of organisms including human disease. Here, we report a variation in five miRNA levels between gender and tissue. Our results suggest that the transcription levels of these five miRNAs are directly regulated by their RNA.",2024,Sep,Biomolecules,14,9,,,10.3390/biom14091183,39334949,#712,Sener 2024,"",""
Effect of mode of delivery on postpartum weight retention: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Wang M; Ji Y; Chen S; Lin X; Yang M,"OBJECTIVE: Retention of weight gained over pregnancy increases the risk of long-term obesity and related health concerns. While many risk factors for this postpartum weight retention have been examined, the role of mode of delivery in this relationship remains controversial. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of mode of delivery on postpartum weight retention. METHODS: Ten electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan-Fang database, the VIP database and China Biology Medicine Database (CBM) were searched from inception through November 2022. Review Manager 5.4 was used to pool the study data and calculate effect sizes. For dichotomous data, the odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval were used to report the results. For continuous data, the mean difference (MD) and 95 % confidence interval were used to report the results. The outcomes were the amount of postpartum weight retention and the number or proportion of women who experienced postpartum weight retention. The Newcastle- Ottawa Scale (NOS) and GRADE Guidelines were used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. FINDINGS: A total of 16 articles were included in the systematic review and 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the mode of delivery had a significant effect on postpartum weight retention, women who delivered by caesarean section were more likely to experience postpartum weight retention compared to those who delivered vaginally. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were stable and credible. CONCLUSION: Due to the limitations of this study, the findings need to be treated with caution. And, to better prevent the postpartum weight retention, future practice and research need to further focus on upstream modifiable factors.",2024,May,Midwifery,132,,103981,,10.1016/j.midw.2024.103981,38574440,#713,Wang 2024,"",""
Gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention in a cohort of Nova Scotian women.,Ashley-Martin J; Woolcott C,"Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) may predispose mothers to becoming overweight or obese. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between GWG, according to the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, and postpartum weight retention (PPWR). A cohort of 12,875 women from Nova Scotia, Canada with at least two consecutively recorded pregnancies was identified through a population-based perinatal database between 1993 and 2010. GWG was calculated as the difference between delivery and prepregnancy weights. PPWR, analyzed as a continuous variable in linear regression models, was calculated via interpregnancy weight change. Fifty eight percent of the total study population gained in excess of the IOM guidelines. Mean PPWR, adjusted for age and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) among women with excess GWG was 5.0 kg (95 % CI 4.9-5.2), greater than women with adequate (2.1 kg, 95 % CI 1.8-2.3) or inadequate GWG (0.3 kg, 95 % CI 0-0.7). Effect modification by prepregnancy BMI was observed; the relationship between excess GWG and increased PPWR was observed in all prepregnancy BMI categories, yet was greatest among underweight women (7.5 kg, 95 % CI 6.6-8.3). Effect modification by parity was also observed; in contrast to multiparous women, primiparous women who gained in excess of GWG guidelines retained more postpartum weight (5.3 kg, 95 % CI 5.1-5.5 vs. 4.3 kg, 95 % CI 4.0-4.7). This study demonstrates that excess GWG is associated with an increase in the amount of weight retained after pregnancy.

Bone turnover markers in the early stage of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis of the hip.,Yasuda T; Matsunaga K; Hashimura T; Tsukamoto Y; Sueyoshi T; Ota S; Fujita S; Onishi E,"OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have demonstrated that patients with end-stage rapidly progressive osteoarthritis of the hip (RPOH) show significantly higher serum levels of bone turnover markers than those with osteoarthritis (OA). However, the characteristics of bone turnover markers in the early stage of RPOH remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the association of bone turnover markers with disease progression in the early stage of RPOH. METHODS: This study included 29 postmenopausal female patients with joint space narrowing >2 mm demonstrated on a series of radiographs and computed tomography within 1 year following the onset of hip pain. The study also included 9 postmenopausal female patients with hip OA secondary to developmental dysplasia showing femoral head destruction. Cortical thickness index (CTI) associated with bone mineral density of the hip was analyzed. Serum concentrations of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were evaluated. RESULTS: RPOH was classified into two types on the basis of the absence (type 1, n=13) or presence (type 2, n=16) of subsequent destruction of the femoral head within 1 year following disease onset. TRACP-5b and BAP significantly increased in RPOH type 2 compared with type 1 and OA. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses indicated that TRACP-5b and BAP could differentiate RPOH type 2 from type 1 within 1 year following the onset. CTI showed no difference among the RPOH types 1 and 2 and OA.

METHODS: A two-center retrospective cohort study of women with a singleton gestation with pPROM at < 34(0/7) weeks of gestation in the presence of cervical cerclage (January 1, 2012-July 30, 2016). Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between women in whom cerclage was removed within 24 h from pPROM and those in whom cerclage was retained until the onset of delivery. The primary outcome was time from pPROM to delivery. RESULTS: Seventy women met inclusion criteria. Cerclage was left in situ in 47 (67.1%) and removed in 23 (32.9%) women. Women in the cerclage retention group had a higher pPROM-to-delivery interval (7.0 ± 7.2 vs. 6.0 ± 10.9 days, p = 0.03), and were more likely to have a latency period > 48 h (87.2% vs. 65.2%, p = 0.03; aOR 3.9, 95% CI 3.1-4.9) or > 7 days (29.8% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.04; aOR 7.0, 95% CI 2.5-19.6) compared with women in whom cerclage was removed.

There were no differences between the groups in early neonatal sepsis, severe brain injury, or composite neonatal outcome. CONCLUSION: In women with pPROM and cervical cerclage, retention of cerclage may be associated with a longer latency period, and a lower chorioamnionitis rate, without an associated increase in the risk of neonatal infectious morbidity.

Factors associated with long-term antiretroviral therapy attrition among adolescents in rural Uganda: a retrospective study.,Okoboi S; Ssali L; Yansaneh AI; Bakanda C; Birungi J; Nantume S; Okullu JL; Sharp AR; Moore DM; Kalibala S,"INTRODUCTION: As access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases, the success of treatment programmes depends on ensuring high patient retention in HIV care. We examined retention and attrition among adolescents in ART programmes across clinics operated by The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) in Uganda, which has operated both facility- and community-based distribution models of ART delivery since 2004. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort analysis of patient-level clinical data, we examined attrition and retention in HIV care and factors associated with attrition among HIV-positive adolescents aged 10-19 years who initiated ART at 10 TASO clinics between January 2006 and December 2011. Retention in care was defined as the proportion of adolescents who had had at least one facility visit within the six months prior to 1 June 2013, and attrition was defined as the proportion of adolescents who died, were lost to follow-up, or stopped treatment. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the levels of retention in HIV care and the factors associated with attrition following ART initiation. RESULTS: A total of 1228 adolescents began ART between 2006 and 2011, of whom 57% were female. The median duration in HIV care was four years (IQR=3-6 years). A total of 792 (65%) adolescents were retained in care over the five-year period; 36 (3%) had died or transferred out and 400 (32%) were classified as loss to follow-up. Factors associated with attrition included being older (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.86), having a higher CD4 count (250+ cells/mm(3)) at treatment initiation (AHR=0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.69) and HIV care site with a higher risk of attrition among adolescents in Gulu (AHR=2.26; 95% CI 1.27-4.02) and Masindi (AHR=3.30, 95% CI 1.87-5.84) and a lower risk of attrition in Jinja (AHR=0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.70). Having an advanced WHO clinical stage at initiation was not associated with attrition. CONCLUSIONS: We found an overall retention rate of 65%, which is comparable to rates achieved by TASO's adult patients and adolescents in other studies in Africa. Variations in the risk of attrition by TASO treatment site and by clinical and demographic characteristics suggest the need for early diagnosis of HIV infection, use of innovative approaches to reach and retain adolescents living with HIV in treatment and identifying specific groups, such as older adolescents, that are at high risk of dropping out of treatment for targeted care and support.",2016,,J Int AIDS Soc,19,5 Suppl 4,20841,,10.7448/IAS.19.5.20841  20841,27443271,#718,Okoboi 2016,"",""

Objectives: Aims of this study were: (i) to assess the drug retention rate (DRR) of ANA during a long-term follow-up looking for any difference related to the line of biologic treatment, the concomitant use of conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) and the different type of AOSD (systemic versus chronic articular); (ii) to identify predictive factors of lack of efficacy, loss of efficacy, and ANA withdrawal owing to long-term remission. Methods: AOSD patients classified according with Yamaguchi criteria and treated with ANA were retrospectively enrolled in 18 Italian tertiary Centers. Demographic, laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related to the start of ANA (baseline), the 3-month assessment and the last follow-up visit while on ANA treatment were retrospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Results: One hundred and forty-one AOSD patients (48 males, 93 females) treated with ANA for a mean period of 35.96 ± 36.05 months were enrolled. The overall DRR of ANA was 44.6 and 30.5% at the 60- and 120-month assessments, respectively, with no significant differences between: (i) biologic naïve patients and those previously treated with other biologics (log-rank p = 0.97); (ii) monotherapy and concomitant use of cDMARDs (log-rank p = 0.45); (iii) systemic and chronic articular types of AOSD (log-rank p = 0.67). No variables collected at baseline could predict primary inefficacy, while the number of swollen joints at baseline was significantly associated with secondary inefficacy (p = 0.01, OR = 1.194, C.I. 1.043-1.367). The typical AOSD skin rash was negatively related with ANA withdrawal owing to long-term remission (p = 0.03, OR = 0.224, C.I. 0.058-0.863). Conclusion: Long-term DRR of ANA has been found excellent and is not affected by different lines of biologic treatment, concomitant use of cDMARDs, or type of AOSD. The risk of losing ANA efficacy increases along with the number of swollen joints at the start of therapy, while the typical skin rash is a negative predictor of ANA withdrawal related to sustained remission.",2019,,Front Pharmacol,10,,296,,10.3389/fphar.2019.00296,31001115,#721,Vitale 2019,"",""
The Association Between Serum Biomarkers of Collagen Turnover and Subsequent Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture.,Svoboda SJ; Owens BD; Harvey TM; Tarwater PM; Brechue WF; Cameron KL,"BACKGROUND: No study has attempted to associate the levels of preinjury serum biomarkers of collagen turnover with the subsequent risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. HYPOTHESIS: Preinjury serum biomarkers of collagen turnover would be associated with the subsequent risk of ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 45 ACL-injured cases and 45 controls matched for sex, age, height, and weight. In addition to the matching criteria, controls had no history of major joint injury. Baseline preinjury serum samples were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository for all subjects. Samples were assessed for 2 serum biomarkers of collagen synthesis (CPII and CS846) and 2 markers of collagen degradation (C1,2C and C2C) through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. All ELISAs were performed in triplicate. Conditional logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Univariate results suggested that both biomarkers for collagen degradation (C1,2C and C2C) were significantly associated with the subsequent likelihood of ACL injury. Serum C2C and C1,2C concentration at baseline were associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.05 (95% CI, 1.30-3.23; P = .001) and 3.02 (95% CI, 1.60-5.71; P = .002), respectively. Baseline serum CPII concentrations were also associated with subsequent ACL injury. Serum CPII concentration at baseline was associated with an OR of 4.41 (95% CI, 1.87-10.38; P = .001). Baseline serum CS846 levels approached significance (OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.03; P = .080). Multivariable models suggested that preinjury CPII and C2C concentrations at baseline are important indicators of subsequent ACL injury risk. CONCLUSION: Preinjury differences in serum biomarker levels of collagen turnover suggest that collagen metabolism in individuals who go on to tear an ACL may be different when compared with a matched control group with no history of major joint injury. These differences may be reflective of different preinjury biochemical and/or biomechanical risk profiles or genetic factors that subsequently affect both collagen metabolism and ACL injury risk.",2016,Jul,Am J Sports Med,44,7,1687-93,,10.1177/0363546516640515,27159304,#723,Svoboda 2016,"",""
Can gamified surgical sets improve surgical instrument recognition and student performance retention in the operating room? A multi-institutional experimental crossover study.,Masoumian Hosseini M; Sadat Manzari Z; Gazerani A; Masoumian Hosseini ST; Rohaninasab M,"INTRODUCTION: Surgery requires a high degree of precision, speed, and concentration. Owing to the complexity of the modern world, traditional methods cannot meet these requirements. Therefore, in this study, we investigated students' diagnostic skills in the Operating Room in the context of surgical instruments by using gamification of surgical instruments and a crossover design. METHOD: The study design was a multi-institutional quasi-experimental crossover and involved a three-arm intervention (with gender-specific block randomisation: Group A, B, and C) with a pre-test and three post-tests. A total of 90 students fell into three groups of 30 participants each. The surgical sets were learned for one semester through game-based instruction and traditional teaching, and then three OSCE tests were administered with time and location differences. Using one-way ANOVA, OSCE results were compared in the game, traditional, and control groups. The effectiveness of the intervention was tested in each group by repeated measures. RESULT: The pretest scores of all three groups did not differ significantly. In the OSCE tests, both groups, A and B, performed similarly. However, these tests showed a significant difference in grouping between training through games and training in the traditional way. There was no significant difference between OSCE tests 2 and 3 in the game-based training group, indicating that what was learned was retained, while in the traditional method training group, OSCE 3 test scores declined significantly. Furthermore, repeated measures showed the effectiveness of game-based training. CONCLUSION: In this study, gamification has turned out to be very effective in helping learners learn practical skills and leading to more sustainable learning.",2023,Nov,BMC Med Educ,23,1,907,,10.1186/s12909-023-04868-z,38031011,#724,MasoumianHosseini 2023,"",""
Influence of prenatal perceived stress on postpartum weight retention is mediated by high gestational weight gain in women with overweight.,Leonard KS; Adams EL; Savage JS; Paul IM; Kraschnewski JL; Pattison KL; Kjerulff KH; Symons Downs D,"Women with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are at risk for poor psychosocial well-being and postpartum weight retention (PPWR). Scant research has examined longitudinal interrelations of GWG, psychosocial factors, and PPWR. This study examined: (a) pre-pregnancy weight status (ie, normal, overweight, obesity) differences in PPWR and its psychosocial determinants (perceived social support, perceived stress, depression) in women with excessive GWG (ie, above 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines); and (b) whether GWG mediated associations between psychosocial determinants and PPWR. Women (N = 1352) reported third trimester perceived social support, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms, GWG, and 6- and 12-month PPWR via telephone interviews. Multivariate ANOVA analyses showed women with normal weight had higher 6-month PPWR than women with obesity; univariate ANOVA showed no group differences in psychosocial factors. Hayes mediation analyses indicated that GWG mediated the association between perceived stress and PPWR in women with overweight but not women with normal weight or obesity; perceived stress predicted GWG, and in turn, PPWR. Prenatal perceived stress may be a modifiable target of GWG and PPWR. Future research is needed to examine the utility of tailoring perinatal weight regulation interventions to reduce perceived stress in pregnant women with overweight.",2021,Jun,Clin Obes,11,3,e12446,,10.1111/cob.12446,33675292,#725,Leonard 2021,"",""
Estimating tempo and mode of Y chromosome turnover: explaining Y chromosome loss with the fragile Y hypothesis.,Blackmon H; Demuth JP,"Chromosomal sex determination is phylogenetically widespread, having arisen independently in many lineages. Decades of theoretical work provide predictions about sex chromosome differentiation that are well supported by observations in both XY and ZW systems. However, the phylogenetic scope of previous work gives us a limited understanding of the pace of sex chromosome gain and loss and why Y or W chromosomes are more often lost in some lineages than others, creating XO or ZO systems. To gain phylogenetic breadth we therefore assembled a database of 4724 beetle species' karyotypes and found substantial variation in sex chromosome systems. We used the data to estimate rates of Y chromosome gain and loss across a phylogeny of 1126 taxa estimated from seven genes. Contrary to our initial expectations, we find that highly degenerated Y chromosomes of many members of the suborder Polyphaga are rarely lost, and that cases of Y chromosome loss are strongly associated with chiasmatic segregation during male meiosis. We propose the ""fragile Y"" hypothesis, that recurrent selection to reduce recombination between the X and Y chromosome leads to the evolution of a small pseudoautosomal region (PAR), which, in taxa that require XY chiasmata for proper segregation during meiosis, increases the probability of aneuploid gamete production, with Y chromosome loss. This hypothesis predicts that taxa that evolve achiasmatic segregation during male meiosis will rarely lose the Y chromosome. We discuss data from mammals, which are consistent with our prediction.",2014,Jun,Genetics,197,2,561-72,,10.1534/genetics.114.164269,24939995,#726,Blackmon 2014,"",""

We conducted a pre-trial analysis of data from the WelTel Retain study on retention in HIV care to assess gender-based differences in phone access, phone sharing and concerns about receiving text messages from a healthcare provider. Methods Between April 2013-June 2015, HIV-positive adults were screened for trial participation at two clinics in urban slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Proportions of men and women excluded from the trial due to phone-related criteria were compared using a chi-square test. Gender-based differences in phone sharing patterns and concerns among trial participants were similarly compared. Results Of 1068 individuals screened, there was no difference in the proportion of men ( n = 39/378, 10.3%) and women ( n = 71/690, 10.3%) excluded because of phone-related criteria ( p-value = 0.989). Among those who shared their phone, women ( n = 52/108, 48.1%) were more likely than men ( n = 6/60, 10.0%) to share with other non-household and household members ( p < 0.001). Few participants had concerns about receiving text messages from their healthcare provider; those with concerns were all women ( n = 6/700). Discussion In this study, men and women were equally able to participate in a trial of an mHealth intervention.

METHODS: The patients with adjacent teeth missing in the posterior jaw seeking for implant restoration in the Department of Implantology, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology from March, 2017 to February, 2018 were recruited. After implant placement and commercial conic retention coping delivery, the patient had an intraoral scan for digital impression, and the computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology was used for the fabrication of the immediate splinted prosthesis, which was made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and loaded immediately after delivery. Six months later, all the temporary prostheses were replaced by the permanent ones made of monolithic zirconia with CAD/CAM technology as well. The parallel periapical films were taken for the temporary and permanent prostheses post-delivery. The clinical effect of this workflow was evaluated by indices including the survival rates of implants and prostheses, the change of marginal bone level, and the implant-related and prosthesis-related complications; before the final restoration, the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) was used to evaluate the satisfaction of the patients. RESULTS: Ten patients (4 males and 6 females, 55.5 years old for average) were recruited. Totally 34 implants were placed; 14 prostheses were fabricated, temporary and permanent, respectively. After an observation period from 4 to 14 months, the survival rate for implants and prostheses were both 100%; the marginal bone level of the implants were (1.06±0.97) mm and (0.96±0.82) mm, immediate post-operation and 6 months later, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Neither implant- nor prostheses- related complications were observed. And the VAS of the patients' satisfaction was 87.2.

In this study we evaluated whether non-traditional fieldworker shifts (after hours during the week and weekends) enhanced participant retention when compared to retention during traditional weekday shifts in the HPTN 071 (PopART) population cohort (PC). METHODS: HPTN 071 (PopART) PC participants were recruited and followed up in their homes on an annual basis by research fieldworkers over a 3-4 year period. The average number of successful follow-up visits, where a PC participant was found and retained in the study, was calculated for each of 3 visit schedules (early weekday shift, late weekday shift, and Saturday shift), and standardized to account for variation in fieldwork shift duration. We used one-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) to describe differences in mean-successful visits and 95% confidence intervals between the shift types. RESULTS: Data on 16 651 successful visits were included. Successful visit rates were higher when conducting Saturday visits (14.0; 95% CI: 11.3-16.6) compared to both regular (4.5; 95% CI: 3.7-5.3) and late weekday shifts (5.3; 95% CI: 4.7-5.8) overall and in all subgroup analyses (P<0.001). The successful visit rate was higher amongst women than men were during all shift types (3.2 vs. 1.3, p<0.001). Successful visit rates by shift type did not differ significantly by age, over time, by PC round or by community triplet. CONCLUSION: The number of people living with HIV continues to increase annually. High quality evidence from longitudinal studies remains critical for evaluating HIV prevention and treatment strategies. This study showed a significant benefit on participant retention through introduction of Saturday shifts for home visits and these data can make an important contribution to the emerging body of evidence for improving retention in longitudinal research.

Effects of denture adhesive on the retention of milled and heat-activated maxillary denture bases: A clinical study.,AlRumaih HS; AlHelal A; Baba NZ; Goodacre CJ; Al-Qahtani A; Kattadiyil MT,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Clinical studies have identified advantages of digital complete denture technology including patient satisfaction, improved mastication, increased retention, and technique efficiency. However, studies that focus on the effect of denture adhesive on the retention of milled and heat-activated denture bases are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the effectiveness of denture adhesive on the retention of milled and heat-activated denture bases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty participants with complete maxillary edentulism were selected for this study (11 men and 9 women). Definitive impressions were obtained and scanned (iSeries impression scanner; Dental Wings). Digital data were sent to Global Dental Science for the fabrication of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milled denture bases (MB condition). The physical impressions were poured in stone to produce casts for the fabrication of heat-activated acrylic resin denture bases (HB condition). A portable clinical motorized test stand and advance digital force gauge were modified to measure the amount of denture base retention in newtons. The denture bases were seated over the edentulous maxillary ridge and pulled 3 times vertically at 10-minute intervals without denture adhesive (MB and HB control conditions) and with denture adhesive (MBA and HBA test conditions). For statistical analysis, a repeated-measures ANOVA was performed (α=.05). RESULTS: The control MB condition had significantly higher retention values compared with all other conditions (P<.001). However, the use of adhesive significantly decreased the retention of the milled bases. No significant differences were found with or without the use of denture adhesive among heat-activated denture bases (P>.05).

Moxibustion therapy for treating patients with postpartum urinary retention: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.,Li T; Hui X; Wang H; Lin Y; Zhao B,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum urinary retention (PUR) is one of the most common complications after parturition which affect women's recovery after childbirth. Many clinical trials have shown that moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medicine therapy, is effective in treating PUR. But its effectiveness has not been evaluated scientifically and systematically. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of moxibustion therapy in treating patients with PUR.

NASS-CDS analysis of high retention seat performance in rear impacts.,Viano DC; Parenteau CS,"PURPOSE: A recent study used the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to determine the safety performance of high retention seats in fatal rear impacts. The odds of fatal injury were reduced 46.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.3-52.4, z = 9.982, P <.0001) with high retention seats. This study extends the earlier one by establishing an exposure group of nonfatal occupants in towaway crashes using NASS-CDS. METHODS: The 2001-2008 NASS-CDS was analyzed for rear impacts of 1992 to 2008 model year GM vehicles with high retention or baseline seats using the same search strategy as in FARS. Injuries were analyzed by severity (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale [MAIS]). The number of fatalities from FARS and number of nonfatal occupants from NASS-CDS were used to determine the risk for fatal injury in towaway crashes with 5-7 o'clock principal direction of force (PDOF). The odds ratio for fatal injury and the change in fatality risk were determined with ±95% confidence intervals, z-statistics, and significance levels. Injury risks were also determined using NASS-CDS. RESULTS: Based on 2001-2008 FARS and NASS-CDS, the fatality risk was 0.21% in high retention seats and 0.39% in baseline seats in 5-7 o'clock towaway crashes. The odds for fatality were 46.8% (95% CI, 39.8-53.0, z = 10.001, P <.0001) lower with high retention seats. There was a higher trend for lower serious-to-critical injury in high retention seats than baseline seats in NASS-CDS. Six electronic cases were available in NASS-CDS with fatal injury in high retention seats. Only one involved the seat performance as a factor in the fatality, a 72-year-old belted female in a 14 mph rear delta V impact who experienced fractures of the thoracic spine. Her upper body likely wrapped around the upright seatback. CONCLUSIONS: High retention seats significantly reduced the odds for fatal injury in towaway crashes with 5-7 o'clock PDOF.

Identification of key factors related to digital health observational study adherence and retention by data-driven approaches: an exploratory secondary analysis of two prospective longitudinal studies.,Cho PJ; Olaye IM; Shandhi MMH; Daza EJ; Foschini L; Dunn JP,"BACKGROUND: Longitudinal digital health studies combine passively collected information from digital devices, such as commercial wearable devices, and actively contributed data, such as surveys, from participants. Although the use of smartphones and access to the internet supports the development of these studies, challenges exist in collecting representative data due to low adherence and retention. We aimed to identify key factors related to adherence and retention in digital health studies and develop a methodology to identify factors that are associated with and might affect study participant engagement. METHODS: In this exploratory secondary analysis, we used data from two separate prospective longitudinal digital health studies, conducted among adult participants (age ≥18 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic by the BIG IDEAs Laboratory (BIL) at Duke University (Durham, NC, USA; April 2, 2020 to May 25, 2021) and Evidation Health (San Mateo, CA, USA; April 4 to Aug 31, 2020). Prospective daily or weekly surveys were administered for up to 15 months in the BIL study and daily surveys were administered for 5 months in the Evidation Health study. We defined metrics related to adherence to assess how participants engage with longitudinal digital health studies and developed models to infer how demographic factors and the day of survey delivery might be associated with these metrics. We defined retention as the time until a participant drops out of the study. For the purpose of clustering analysis, we defined three metrics of survey adherence: (1) total number of surveys completed, (2) participation regularity (ie, frequency of filling out surveys consecutively), and (3) time of activity (ie, engagement pattern relative to enrolment time). We assessed these metrics and explored differences by age, sex, race, and day of survey delivery. We analysed the data by unsupervised clustering, survival analysis, and recurrent event analysis with multistate modelling, with analyses restricted to individuals who provided data on age, sex, and race. FINDINGS: In the BIL study, 5784 unique participants with the required demographic data completed 388 600 unique daily surveys (mean 67 [SD 90] surveys per participant). In the Evidation Health study, 89 479 unique participants with the required demographic data completed 2 080 992 unique daily surveys (23 [32] surveys per participant). Participants were grouped into adherence clusters based on the three metrics of adherence, and we identified statistically discernible differences in age, race, and sex between clusters. Most of the individuals aged 18-29 years were observed in the clusters with low or medium adherence, whereas the oldest age group (≥60 years) was generally more represented in clusters with high adherence than younger age groups. For retention, survival analysis indicated that 18-29 years was the age group with the highest risk of exiting the study at any given point in time (BIL study, hazard ratio [HR] for 18-29 years vs ≥60 years, 1·69 [95% CI 1·53-1·86; p<0·0001]; Evidation Health study, HR 1·50 [1·47-1·53; p<0·0001]). Sex and race were not discernible predictors of retention in the BIL study. In the Evidation Health study, male participants (vs female participants; HR 0·96 [0·94-0·98]; p<0·0001) and White participants (vs Asian participants; HR 0·96 [0·93-0·98; p=0·0004) had a lower risk of study exit, and Other race participants (vs Asian participants) had a higher risk of study exit (HR 1·10 [1·06-1·14; p<0·0001]). Recurrent event analysis confirmed age as the factor most associated with adherence; for the 18-29 years age group (vs ≥60 years group), the transition intensity from an active to inactive state per day in the BIL study was 1·661 (95% CI 1·606-1·718) and in the Evidation Health study was 1·108 (1·094-1·121). Participation patterns were variable by race and sex between the studies. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses revealed that age was consistently associated with adherence and retention, with younger participants having lower adherence and higher dropout rates than older participants. Unsupervised clustering and survival analyses are established methods in this field, whereas the use of recurrent event analysis, was, to our knowledge, the first instance of the application of this method to remote digital health data. These methods can help to understand participant engagement in digital health studies, supporting targeted measures to improve adherence and retention.

Prognosis of double crown-retained removable dental prostheses compared with clasp-retained removable dental prostheses: A retrospective study.,Ishida K; Nogawa T; Takayama Y; Saito M; Yokoyama A,"PURPOSE: The present study compared the clinical prognosis of double crown-retained removable dental prostheses (D-DRPs) with that of clasp-retained removable dental prostheses (C-RDPs). METHODS: Clinical records of 201 patients who had received 52 D-RDPs with 144 abutment teeth (D-teeth) and 199 C-RDPs with 399 abutment teeth (C-teeth) at the Prosthetic Dentistry Clinic in Hokkaido University Hospital between April 2005 and June 2015 were analyzed. Survival and complication probabilities of the two types of prostheses and abutment teeth were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the impact of covariates on abutment teeth survival and complications such as gender, age, type of retainer, Eichner classification, jaw, type of tooth, endodontic therapy performed, type of edentulous space, and presence of opposing teeth. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the two types of prostheses in terms of prostheses survival, prostheses complication, and abutment teeth survival. However, a significant difference was observed for complications of abutment teeth. Decementation was the most frequent cause of failure, which occurred in 76.9% of D-teeth and 28.3% of C-teeth. Patient's age, jaw, endodontic therapy performed, and type of edentulous space affected the survival of abutment teeth, whereas the type of retainer and edentulous space affected complications of abutment teeth. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of both types of prostheses was considered to be acceptable.

METHODS: This was a 2-year prospective study conducted at a tertiary care centre in southern India. Baseline assessment included demographic details, mode of presentation, bone mineral biochemistry, BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS), and bone turnover markers (BTMs). These parameters were reassessed at the end of the first and second years following curative parathyroid surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-one subjects (32 men and 19 women) with PHPT who had undergone curative parathyroidectomy were included in this study. The mean (SD) age was 44.6 (13.7) years. The TBS, BTMs, and BMD at lumbar spine and forearm were significantly worse at baseline in subjects with higher baseline PTH (≥250 pg/mL) when compared to the group with lower baseline PTH (<250 pg/mL). At the end of 2 years, the difference between high versus low PTH groups (mean ± SD) persisted only for forearm BMD (0.638±0.093 versus 0.698±0.041 g/cm(2); P =.01). However, on follow-up visits in the first and second year after curative parathyroidectomy, there was no significant difference in BTMs, BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and TBS between the 2 groups stratified by baseline PTH. CONCLUSION: The BMD at the forearm remained significantly worse in individuals with high baseline PTH even at 2 years after surgery, while other parameters including TBS improved significantly from baseline.

Transurethral resection of prostate for acute urinary retention is linked to shorter survival in younger men.,Teoh JY; Chan CK; Wang MH; Leung CH; Chan ES; Chiu PK; Yee CH; Wong HM; Hou SS; Ng CF,"It is largely unknown whether lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or acute retention of urine (AROU) is linked to shorter life expectancy in men. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective database analysis of patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) to study their relationships. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis with stratification to age and indication of TURP were performed. We further performed an age- and sex-matched survival analysis with the general population using data from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong, China). From January 2002 to December 2012, 3496 patients undergoing TURP were included in our study, with 1764 patients in the LUTS group and 1732 patients in the AROU group. Old age, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, and AROU were risk factors of mortality. Patients aged <70 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.09, P = 0.010) and 70-80 years (adjusted HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70, P = 0.001) in the AROU group had worse survival than those in the LUTS group, but such difference was not demonstrated in patients aged >80 years.

Effects on postpartum weight retention after antenatal lifestyle intervention - a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,Ronnberg A; Hanson U; Ostlund I; Nilsson K,"INTRODUCTION: High weight retention after pregnancy is related to an increased risk of future obesity. The objective was to evaluate whether an antenatal intervention, compared with standard care, could reduce postpartum weight retention (PPWR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women with body mass index >19, age ≥18 years, knowledge of Swedish, and pregnancy ≤16 weeks' gestation were randomized. Standard care was compared with a composite intervention including a personalized weight graph, education on recommended weight gain, prescription of exercise, and monitoring of weight until 1 year after delivery. Mean (kg) PPWR was compared between the groups and risk estimates (odds ratio) for excessive weight retention were calculated. RESULTS: Of 445 women randomized, 267 remained for analysis at ≤16 weeks postpartum and 168 at 1 year postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower mean PPWR at ≤16 weeks [1.81 kg (standard deviation, SD, 4.52) vs. 3.19 kg (SD 4.77), p = 0.016]. At one year postpartum, mean retention was still 0.7 kg lower in the intervention group [0.30 kg (SD 5.52) vs. 1.00 kg (SD 5.46)]; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.414). Gestational weight gain above Institute of Medicine recommendations was a significant risk factor for excessive weight retention (>5 kg) one year after delivery (OR 2.44; 95% CI 1.08-5.52, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: A composite lifestyle intervention during pregnancy reduced short-term weight retention, but the effect of the intervention did not remain at 1 year postpartum.

Feasibility of measurement of bone turnover markers in female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,Bogaczewicz J; Karczmarewicz E; Pludowski P; Zabek J; Kowalski J; Lukaszkiewicz J; Wozniacka A,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of bone turnover markers (BTMs) for the assessment of bone metabolism in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), according to the guidelines of the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. METHODS: The study included 43 female SLE patients. Serum procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), osteocalcin, PTH, 25(OH)D, anti-cardiolipin, anti-dsDNA, and anti-nucleosome levels were measured. RESULTS: PINP and CTX levels were elevated in SLE patients aged > 45 in comparison to those aged < 45, although with borderline significance (p = 0.05, respectively). Correlations were found between BTMs: the strongest being between PINP and osteocalcin (τ = 0.69, p < 0.05). PINP and osteocalcin were found to be associated with PTH (τ = 0.3, τ = 0.29, respectively, p < 0.05). Age correlated with PINP (τ = 0.23, p < 0.05). Elevated PINP was found more frequently than elevated osteocalcin or CTX, both in patients aged < 45 (p = 0.001) and > 45 (p < 0.001). No significant difference in PINP, osteocalcin or CTX levels was found with respect to season, neither in the entire SLE group, nor in the under-45 or over-45 groups. Previous glucocorticoid treatment was not associated with difference in BTMs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BTMs in SLE appear to predominantly reflect the pattern of bone remodeling related to age. Increased PINP is expected to be the most frequent outcome among BTMs. Better diagnoses of bone disturbances with BTMs performed in accordance with international reference standards need to be included in the approach to SLE patients, in addition to bone mineral density assessment.",2015,Mar-Apr,Rev Bras Reumatol,55,2,133-9,,10.1016/j.rbr.2014.10.004,25583000,#741,Bogaczewicz 2015,"",""
Retention rate of a novel autoinjector e-Device introduced to patients with chronic arthritis treated with certolizumab pegol in clinical practice: an observational implementation study.,Jørgensen TS; Hansen RL; Pouls B; Van den Bemt B; Sjöwall C; Kristensen LE,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to explore the clinical retention rate of an e-Device aimed at empowering chronic arthritis patients using certolizumab pegol (CZP) and to analyse beliefs about medication in the Danish population. METHOD: Patients treated with CZP were recruited from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden through rheumatology clinics at initiation of, or switching to, the e-Device. Patients were adults (aged 18-85 years) diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, or psoriatic arthritis. Patients administered three consecutive self-injections at home. Descriptive statistics regarding baseline characteristics, retention rates, and reasons for withdrawal were assessed, along with the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 59 patients participated (Netherlands 25, Denmark 15, Sweden 19). Most subjects (71%) were women, with a mean ± sd age of 55 ± 16.2 years and mean disease duration 12 ± 8.8 years. Six patients (10%) started CZP de novo and the remaining patients switched device. The overall retention rate was 42% after 52 weeks, declining to 38% after 104 weeks. A sharp decline, 34%, was seen at week 8. Between weeks 32 and 112, only four patients (6.8%) withdrew from the study. The primary reason for withdrawal was the patient's request. Stratification by country showed significant differences for some outcomes. CONCLUSION: An initial large dropout was evident within the first 8 weeks, with almost no dropouts thereafter. The reasons for withdrawal were primarily patient requests.

Highly Crosslinked-remelted versus Less-crosslinked Polyethylene in Posterior Cruciate-retaining TKAs in the Same Patients.,Kim YH; Park JW; Kim JS; Lee JH,"BACKGROUND: Concern regarding osteolysis attributable to polyethylene wear after TKA, particularly in younger patients, has prompted the introduction of highly crosslinked-remelted polyethylene (HXLPE) for TKAs. However, few in vivo comparative results of TKAs using HXLPE and less-crosslinked polyethylene inserts in the same patients are available, regarding fracture or failure of the locking mechanism of tibial polyethylene inserts or of osteolysis in patients younger than 60 years. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We wanted to determine whether (1) survivorship free from aseptic loosening in knees with HXLPE inserts was different from survivorship in knees with less-crosslinked polyethylene inserts, (2) the prevalence of fracture or failure of the locking mechanism of the tibial polyethylene insert was greater in knees with HXLPE than in those with less-crosslinked polyethylene, and (3) the proportion of patients who had osteolysis develop was greater with HXLPE than with less-crosslinked polyethylene inserts. METHODS: One hundred seventy-one patients with a mean age of 58 ± 8 years (range, 35-59 years) received posterior cruciate-retaining prostheses with a less-crosslinked polyethylene tibial insert in one knee and a HXLPE tibial insert in the contralateral knee. From January 2007 to January 2010, we performed 366 same-day bilateral simultaneous sequential posterior cruciate-retaining TKAs in 183 patients, of whom 171 (93%) participated in this study. All patients during this study period underwent posterior cruciate-retaining TKAs regardless of deformity of the knees and we did not perform posterior-stabilized TKAs during the same period. Patients who had bilateral end-stage osteoarthritis and were younger than 60 years were selected for inclusion. Six patients (4%) were lost to followup before 5 years. Twenty-six patients were males and 145 were females. The mean duration of followup was 6 years (range, 5-8 years). At each followup, patients were assessed for loosening of the components, fracture or failure of the locking mechanism of the polyethylene inserts, or osteolysis. RESULTS: The survival rate of the knee prosthesis at a mean of 5.8 years after surgery was 100% (95% CI, 0.95-1.00) in both groups for the endpoint aseptic loosening and 99.4% (95% CI, 0.95-1.00) in both groups for the endpoint revision. No knee in either group had fracture or failure of the locking mechanism of the tibial polyethylene insert, and none had osteolysis. CONCLUSIONS: With the numbers available, we found no clinically important differences between HXLPE and less-crosslinked polyethylene inserts in posterior cruciate-retaining TKAs. Given that HXLPE is newer, as-yet unproven, and more expensive than the proven technology (less-crosslinked polyethylene), we suggest not adopting HXLPE for clinical use until it shows superiority.

Regional trade of medicinal plants has facilitated the retention of traditional knowledge: case study in Gilgit-Baltistan Pakistan.,Salim MA; Ranjitkar S; Hart R; Khan T; Ali S; Kiran C; Parveen A; Batool Z; Bano S; Xu J,"BACKGROUND: The ethnic groups in Gilgit-Baltistan have been utilizing local resources in their centuries-old traditional healing system. Most tribes within these ethnic groups still rely on traditional healing systems. We aim to understand the current status, uses, and abundance of medicinal plants, associated traditional knowledge, and trade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study incorporated over 300 local community members (70% men and 30% women) in focused group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and homework assignments for 8th to 12th grade students to document traditional knowledge (TK) in six districts in Northeast Pakistan. We calculated various indices such as informant consensus factor, use value, relative frequency of citation, and CoKriging. These indices, along with repetitively used medicinal plants, were used to analyze differences in studied locations. RESULTS: Most of the community members still rely on traditional medication in the study areas. However, we found the highest number of medicinal plants used in Skardu and Gilgit compared to other districts and these two districts also represent trade centers and a highly populated area regarding medicinal plants. Results indicate connection amongst the surveyed villages signifying mixing of knowledge from different sources, with certain areas more influenced by traditional Chinese medicine and others more by Ayurveda and Unani. CONCLUSION: TK is mostly retained with elder community members; however, those directly linked with market value chain retain rich knowledge on traditional use of the medicinal plants from the region. Major trade centers in the region also coincide with a high density of medicinal plant occurrence, knowledge, and higher utilization. Therefore, with the increasing trade in medicinal plant in the region, there is potential for rejuvenation of this knowledge and of plant use in the region.",2019,Jan,J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,15,1,6,,10.1186/s13002-018-0281-0,30691476,#744,Salim 2019,"",""
Face-to-face instruction combined with online resources improves retention of clinical skills among undergraduate nursing students.,Terry VR; Terry PC; Moloney C; Bowtell L,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that online resources used to develop clinical skills among students in the healthcare professions can produce equivalent learning outcomes to traditional face-to-face training methods. Whether clinical competence is retained equally well for online and face-to-face training methods is not yet established. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to compare retention of competence in using an IV infusion pump among nursing students trained in its use using three different protocols. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used. SETTING: The study was conducted in the School of Nursing and Midwifery at a regional university in Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 102 first year nursing students (female=89, male=13) enrolled in a medications course, ranging in age from 18 to 44years. METHODS: Three groups of participants were trained in the use of an IV infusion pump and competence was assessed following a 26-week period of no access to the pump.

Effectiveness of Electroacupuncture for Managing Urinary Retention Post Lumbar Spine Surgery: a retrospective single-cohort study.,Tran PD; Nguyen QD; Ngo TD,"OBJECTIVES: Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent complication following surgical procedures, characterized by an acute inability to void, leading to additional complications and extended hospitalization. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in facilitating spontaneous urination and alleviating anxiety in patients experiencing poor urination. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture in the management of POUR in patients who have undergone lumbar spine surgery. METHODS: This retrospective study conducted at the National Hospital of Acupuncture in Vietnam and reviewed the medical records of patients over 18 years old who underwent lumbar spine surgery and were diagnosed with POUR between January to December 2019. Electroacupuncture was administered at five specific acupuncture points Qugu (CV2), Zhongji (CV3), Zhibian (BL54), Pangguanshu (BL28), and Kunlun (BL60). This study monitored key parameters related to the effectiveness of the acupuncture treatment, including the number of acupuncture treatment sessions required until a patient was successfully treated was recorded, with a maximum of three acupuncture treatment sessions per patient, the time elapsed until urination following the treatment (minutes), and urinary bladder volume before and after treatment (mL). RESULTS: The study demonstrated a 93.3% success rate in treating POUR with electroacupuncture. A significant reduction in post-void residual volume was noted, and patients could void within 30 minutes post-treatment. No significant differences in treatment effectiveness were observed across difference genders and age groups. CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture proved to be a highly effective treatment for POUR in patients post-lumbar spine surgery, with a rapid response time and substantial reduction in PVR.

Enteric infection induces Lark-mediated intron retention at the 5' end of Drosophila genes.,Bou Sleiman M; Frochaux MV; Andreani T; Osman D; Guigo R; Deplancke B,"BACKGROUND: RNA splicing is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that generates protein diversity and contributes to the fine-tuning of gene expression, which may facilitate adaptation to environmental challenges. Here, we employ a systems approach to study alternative splicing changes upon enteric infection in females from classical Drosophila melanogaster strains as well as 38 inbred lines. RESULTS: We find that infection leads to extensive differences in isoform ratios, which results in a more diverse transcriptome with longer 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs). We establish a role for genetic variation in mediating inter-individual splicing differences, with local splicing quantitative trait loci (local-sQTLs) being preferentially located at the 5' end of transcripts and directly upstream of splice donor sites. Moreover, local-sQTLs are more numerous in the infected state, indicating that acute stress unmasks a substantial number of silent genetic variants. We observe a general increase in intron retention concentrated at the 5' end of transcripts across multiple strains, whose prevalence scales with the degree of pathogen virulence. The length, GC content, and RNA polymerase II occupancy of these introns with increased retention suggest that they have exon-like characteristics. We further uncover that retained intron sequences are enriched for the Lark/RBM4 RNA binding motif. Interestingly, we find that lark is induced by infection in wild-type flies, its overexpression and knockdown alter survival, and tissue-specific overexpression mimics infection-induced intron retention. CONCLUSION: Our collective findings point to pervasive and consistent RNA splicing changes, partly mediated by Lark/RBM4, as being an important aspect of the gut response to infection.",2020,Jan,Genome Biol,21,1,4,,10.1186/s13059-019-1918-6,31948480,#747,BouSleiman 2020,"",""

This study examined factors that may contribute to a medical student's decision to consider rural family medicine practice using the Community Apgar Questionnaire (CAQ). METHODS: Third- and fourth-year medical students from 10 medical schools responded to a survey of 62 identified factors deemed to be present when assessing the strengths and challenges of recruiting family physicians to rural communities. Participants could also respond to six demographic questions. Factors were ranked based on importance to respondents and were compared using demographic information. RESULTS: A total of 282 MS-3 and MS-4 students interested in family medicine from 10 US medical schools completed the survey (response rate 19.5%). Forty percent of participants anticipate practicing in a rural setting, followed by 31% for suburban and 29% for urban. The top three factors participants considered when anticipating a rural practice setting were spousal satisfaction, call frequency, and competition/collegiality. Additional differences were found across CAQ factors by future practice setting, gender, and location where the student was raised.

The Genetic Basis of Natural Variation in Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Virgin Egg Retention.,Akhund-Zade J; Bergland AO; Crowe SO; Unckless RL,"Drosophila melanogaster is able to thrive in harsh northern climates through adaptations in life-history traits and physiological mechanisms that allow for survival through the winter. We examined the genetic basis of natural variation in one such trait, female virgin egg retention, which was previously shown to vary clinally and seasonally. To further our understanding of the genetic basis and evolution of virgin egg retention, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the previously sequenced Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) mapping population. We found 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with virgin egg retention and assayed 6 available mutant lines, each harboring a mutation in a candidate gene, for effects on egg retention time. We found that four out of the six mutant lines had defects in egg retention time as compared with the respective controls: mun, T48, Mes-4, and Klp67A Surprisingly, none of these genes has a recognized role in ovulation control, but three of the four genes have known effects on fertility or have high expression in the ovaries. We also found that the SNP set associated with egg retention time was enriched for clinal SNPs. The majority of clinal SNPs had alleles associated with longer egg retention present at higher frequencies in higher latitudes. Our results support previous studies that show higher frequency of long retention times at higher latitude, providing evidence for the adaptive value of virgin egg-retention.",2017,Jan,J Insect Sci,17,1,,,10.1093/jisesa/iew094,28042107,#749,Akhund-Zade 2017,"",""
Factors influencing equine veterinarians' job satisfaction and retention: A focus group study.,Whitaker K; Burnette A; Tan JY; Graves M; Hunt J; Devine E; Anderson S; Kirkendall K; Wisnieski L,"BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of equine veterinarians. Understanding what factors are associated with job satisfaction in equine veterinarians can inform interventions to increase retention in equine medicine. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prominent factors causing work dissatisfaction and burnout in equine veterinarians. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative research study consisting of semi-structured focus groups. METHODS: Thirty-seven current and former equine veterinarians across the United States were recruited via snowball and convenience sampling to answer questions on work history, work-life balance, and perceptions of equine practice. Transcripts were analysed in Delve and coded in the context of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory. A card sorting activity was used to rank the four types of resources in the COR theory (condition, object, energy, and personal). RESULTS: Condition resources were the most frequently mentioned reasons for work dissatisfaction. These included issues with discrimination or bias due to age, race/ethnicity, and gender, unpredictable and long hours, and heavy workloads. Object resources, such as equipment, were rarely mentioned. Energy resources, including pay and student loan debt, were influential, with most participants feeling that equine veterinarians are underpaid. Personal resources, such as problem-solving skills and enjoyment in helping others, improved job satisfaction. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Although recruiting efforts prioritised perspectives of black, indigenous, and people of colour, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus identities, and members with disabilities, demographic information was not directly collected. CONCLUSIONS: The main barriers to equine veterinary retention included a lack of work-life balance, long hours, lower-than-expected pay, and issues with discrimination and bias.

Estrogen deficiency induces changes in bone matrix bound water that do not closely correspond with bone turnover.,Metzger CE; Olayooye P; Tak LY; Culpepper O; LaPlant AN; Jalaie P; Andoh PM; Bandara W; Reul ON; Tomaschke AA; Surowiec RK,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis, marked by estrogen deficiency, is a major contributor to osteoporotic fractures, yet early prediction of fractures in this population remains challenging. Our goal was to explore the temporal changes in bone-specific inflammation, oxidative stress, bone turnover, and bone-matrix water, and their relationship with estrogen deficiency-induced modifications in bone structure and mechanical properties. Additionally, we sought to determine if emerging clinically translatable imaging techniques could capture early bone modifications prior to standard clinical imaging. Two-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats (n = 48) underwent ovariectomy (OVX, n = 24) or sham operations (n = 24). A subgroup of n = 8 rats per group was sacrificed at 2-, 5-, and 10-weeks post-surgery to assess the temporal relationships of inflammation, oxidative stress, bone turnover, bone matrix water, mechanics, and imaging outcomes. OVX rats exhibited higher body weight compared to sham rats at all time points. By 5-weeks, OVX animals showed elevated markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in cortical bone, which persisted throughout the study, while cortical bone formation rate did not differ from sham until 10-weeks. DXA outcomes did not reveal differences between OVX and sham at any time point. Bound water, assessed using ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE MRI), was lower in OVX at the earliest time point (2-weeks) and reduced again at 10-weeks with no difference at 5-weeks. These data demonstrate that bound water assessment using novel UTE MRI technology was lower at the earliest time point following OVX. However, no temporal relationship with bone turnover, inflammation, or oxidative stress was observed at the time points assessed in this study.

Effect of a Mentor Mother Programme on retention of mother-baby pairs in HIV care: A secondary analysis of programme data in Uganda.,Igumbor JO; Ouma J; Otwombe K; Musenge E; Anyanwu FC; Basera T; Mbule M; Scheepers E; Schmitz K,"BACKGROUND: Community healthcare workers (CHWs) play an important role in promoting HIV-care retention. Notwithstanding inconsistencies in the outcomes of CHW programmes, these programmes are known to have a positive effect on retention of mother-baby pairs in HIV-care in sub-Saharan Africa. AIM: The aim of this analysis was to assess the effect of mothers2mothers (m2m) Ugandan Mentor Mother (MM) programme on the retention of mother-baby pairs in HIV-care. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data obtained from the m2m Uganda MM programme in nine East Central districts. The primary data was generated through a quasi-experimental study of women attending prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) clinics in Uganda between January 2011 and March 2014; where those who were enrolled at PMTCT sites with the MM intervention (n = 1161) were compared with those who received standard PMCTCT services without the MM intervention (n = 1143). Frequencies and descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical and continuous measures respectively. Risk factors for retention in care were determined by clustered generalised estimating equations and reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Retention in the PMTCT cascade was significantly higher for mother-baby pairs in the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm across all measured time points (96.7% vs 65.8% at 6 weeks after birth, p<0.001; 81.5% vs 42% at 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding, p<0.001; and 71.2% vs 20.6% at 18 months after birth, p<0.001). Relative to the control group, women in the intervention group were less likely to be lost to follow up following treatment initiation (AOR 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.15). There was no difference in the proportion of the retained mother-baby pairs who received prescribed PMTCT interventions at different time points but a significantly higher number of mother-baby pairs in the intervention arm were retained at different time points. CONCLUSION: HIV positive mothers and their HIV exposed children in the mothers2mothers Ugandan Mentor Mother programme had higher retention in HIV care at every step along the PMTCT cascade. We therefore recommend adoption of this peer-to-peer model in sub-Saharan Africa to complement retention in care strategies and health system interventions especially among priority and key populations.",2019,,PLoS One,14,10,e0223332,,10.1371/journal.pone.0223332,31609974,#752,Igumbor 2019,"",""
Impact of Nursing Leadership Styles on the Staff Turnover Intention in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.,Alasiry SM; Alkhaldi FS,"Background and objectives The efficiency of healthcare systems and nursing care depends on appropriate leadership. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between leadership styles of nurse managers and the staff turnover intention in Saudi Arabia. The nurses' intention to quit their jobs was considered as indicative of staff turnover intention. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among 279 nurses, employed in three hospitals in Hafar Al-Batin City, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire comprised three parts to determine the association between leadership styles of nurse managers and staff turnover intention, and how they related to participants' demographic variables (gender/age/education/income/marital status/experience). The first part collected demographic data, and the second part was an adapted and validated version of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ-6S) used to assess the perceived leadership styles of nurse managers, based on 21 items. The third part, comprising seven items, was used to assess nurses' turnover based on intention to quit. The second and third parts of the questionnaire were scored using a five-point Likert scale. Collected data were tabulated and analyzed using a statistical software package for descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and correlation), comparing dependent outcome variables against independent demographic variables. Statistical significance was assumed when p-value was less than 0.05. Results Based on leadership style scores, transactional (13.32 out of a maximum of 24; 55.48%) and transformational (26.58 out of a maximum of 48; 55.37%) leadership were the most frequently perceived leadership styles among nurse managers. Laissez-faire leadership (6.31 out of a maximum of 12; 52.57%) was the least frequently perceived style. Upon comparing perceived leadership styles of nurse managers against demographic variables, no significant differences were observed for transformational leadership. However, income and experience of nurses showed significant relationship with the perceived transactional and laissez-faire leadership style scores, respectively. Based on perceived ""intention to quit"" scores, majority of the nurses expressed uncertain intention to quit (n = 193; 69.2%) and there was a significant yet weak negative correlation between the perceived leadership styles and intention to quit. The correlation coefficient (Pearson's-r) was lowest for laissez-faire leadership (-0.258) followed by transactional (-0.295) and transformational styles of leadership (-0.348). Conclusions The present study indicated a greater degree of transactional and transformational leadership styles among nurse managers than laissez-faire leadership style. While most of the nurses mentioned an uncertain intention to quit, correlating it with the perceived leadership styles it was found that transformational leadership among nurse managers indicated greater retention of nurses within their present jobs. The present research findings underline the importance of prioritizing and fostering healthy workplace environment by the nurse managers, through inculcation of transformational leadership practices. Furthermore, focused, multi-centric studies from around the world can help understand the leadership practices of nursing leaders and its relationship with the intention of nurses to quit their respective roles.",2024,Oct,Cureus,16,10,e70676,,10.7759/cureus.70676,39493018,#753,Alasiry 2024,"",""
"[Gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention: data from the 2015 birth cohort in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil].",Flores TR; Nunes BP; Miranda VIA; Silveira MFD; Domingues MR; Bertoldi AD,"The study's objectives were to describe the prevalence of gestational weight gain and weight retention at 3 and 12 months postpartum and to identify possible socioeconomic inequalities in adequate gestational weight gain. A longitudinal study was performed with data from the 2015 Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, birth cohort. Gestational weight gain was classified according to the US Institute of Medicine guidelines. Weight retention at 3 and 12 months was calculated according to the mother's weight at each period, subtracting pregestational weight. To identify possible inequalities, the study used Slope Index (SII) and Concentration Index (CIX). The sample included mothers with information on the study's outcome (n = 4,102). Prevalence of adequate gestational weight gain was 33.5% (95% confidence interval - 95%CI: 32.1; 35.0). Slight inequalities were observed in the prevalence of adequate weight gain in mothers with less schooling [CIX = 1.88 (95%CI: -0.76; 4.52); SII = 4.27 (95%CI: -0.87; 9.41)] and in mothers belonging to the poorest income quintile- 1st quintile- [CIX = 1.04 (95%CI: -1.60; 3.67); SII = 2.93 (95%CI: -2.06; 7.92)], but these differences were not statistically significant.

Higher Intron Retention Levels in Female Alzheimer's Brains May Be Linked to Disease Prevalence.,Choo CT; Leow CY; Ong CT,"Multimodal study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed AD-related aberrant intron retention (IR) and proteomic changes not observed at the RNA level. However, the role of sex and how IR may impact the proteome are unclear. Analysis of DLPFC transcriptome showed a clear sex-biased pattern where female AD had 1645 elevated IR events compared to 80 in male AD DLPFC. Increased IR is correlated with lower mRNA levels, suggestive of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Two hundred thirty-three mRNAs with elevated IR in females were curated AD genes enriched for ubiquitin-like protein ligase and Tau protein binding. Increased IR genes in combined sex and female AD cohorts showed significant changes in their protein expression patterns with 11%-24% of them differential expressed proteins (DEP), alluding to the regulation of AD proteome by IR independent of RNA level. Upregulated DEPs in male AD were linked to RNA splicing that may prevent aberrant IR, whereas in female AD, they overlapped significantly more with the MAPK/metabolism module associated with cognitive decline. IR genes appeared to be significantly downregulated in specific female AD inhibitory and excitatory neurons compared to control. Differentially retained introns in female AD have elevated H3K27ac marks, strong CTCF binding at their flanking exons, and enriched for PABPC1 motif. Given that H3K27ac is repressive over gene bodies in aged brain and CTCF impedes transcription elongation, their binding patterns can delay co-transcriptional recruitment of spliceosome to cause IR, which may in turn contribute to different trajectories of AD pathology in women.",2025,Jan,Aging Cell,,,e14457,,10.1111/acel.14457,39804791,#755,Choo 2025,"",""
Bone turnover markers and muscle decay indicator in patients with proximal femur fracture - a case-control study.,Łapiński M; Żarnovsky K; Czarzasta K; Maciąg B; Maciąg G; Adamska O; Mamcarz A; Stolarczyk A,"INTRODUCTION: Fracture of the proximal femur is common in elderly patients, in fact threatening their lives. Age-related sarcopenia may be involved in the imbalance resulting in the injury. Handy and readily accessible biochemical tests would be useful to assess the musculoskeletal system condition in daily practice. The aim of the study was to determine whether there is any relation between muscle decay and fracture of the proximal femur and to assess bone quality in elderly patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the study 22 patients who represented the treatment group were hospitalized due to proximal femur fracture. Eighteen patients from the control group with no fracture in their history were admitted to the Internal Medicine Department. Anyone treated for osteoporosis, immune disease affecting protein balance, neoplasm, mental illness, heart failure, or myocardial infarction was excluded from the study. In every case a blood sample from an elbow vein was drawn, collected in EDTA-K2 tubes, and then centrifuged to separate plasma from the whole blood. Subsequently, the concentrations of C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and creatine kinase (CK) in plasma were determined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The CK plasma concentration differed between the patient groups (p = 0.011). The SHBG plasma concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group (p = 0.006), whereas a slight difference in CTX-I plasma concentration between the groups was found (p = 0.038). No significant correlations between plasma CK, SHBG or CTX-I were found (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Creatine kinase is actually not an appropriate marker for the clinical assessment of muscle tissue quality in patients with or at risk of proximal femur fracture. Analyzing the quality of bone tissue, we can conclude it was poorer in patients with proximal femur fracture than in the control group.",2024,,Reumatologia,62,2,121-127,,10.5114/reum/187096,38799774,#756,Łapiński 2024,"",""
The Effects of Testosterone on Bone Turnover Markers Among Hormone-Naive Transgender Men.,Chavaengkiat S; Suwan A; Panyakhamlerd K; Wattanachanya L; Bumphenkiatikul T,"PURPOSE: Transgender medicine has become rapidly recognized and evolving in the health care system. The consequences of hormone therapy are among the most concerning health issues in the transgender population. This study aims to compare bone turnover markers before and after testosterone administration in hormone-naive transgender men. METHODS: This prospective study included 20 hormone-naive transgender men. Comparisons of serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at baseline with 12 weeks and 24 weeks were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Serum procollagen type I N-propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin levels at 24 weeks compared to baseline were also assessed. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was used to compare the correlation between serum bone turnover markers and sex hormone levels. RESULTS: At 12 weeks after testosterone administration, significant higher serum CTX level compared to baseline (p-value 0.035) was demonstrated. At 24 weeks after testosterone administration, there were significant differences in serum CTX, P1NP, and osteocalcin levels compared to baseline (p-value 0.019, <0.001, and 0.003, respectively). Serum CTX, P1NP, and osteocalcin levels significantly increased 28.30%, 44.26%, and 21.89%, respectively, at 24 weeks after testosterone treatment. There was a moderate negative correlation between serum CTX and estradiol level. CONCLUSION: Testosterone administration in transgender men significantly increased the levels of bone turnover markers. Further, well-controlled studies of bone health in transgender men are required to prove and assess the other aspects of bone status over a long-term follow-up period.Thai Clinical Trial Registry identification number TCTR20220817002.",2024,Dec,Transgend Health,9,6,501-507,,10.1089/trgh.2023.0056,39735369,#757,Chavaengkiat 2024,"",""
The Role of Long Term Label-Retaining Cells in the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction by Vacuum Erectile Device.,Yang B; Luse D; Cao Y; Ko T; Wang R,"INTRODUCTION: Vacuum erectile device (VED) therapy is commonly used for penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy, however, the underlying mechanism of this effect is not fully understood. AIM: To evaluate the presence of label-retaining cells (LRCs), cells with long-term retention of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling and recognized as adult stem cells or progenitor-like cells, in cavernous tissue after VED treatment using a BCNC rat model. METHODS: Postnatal pups (1 day old) of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with EdU (50 ug/g, BID for 3 days) and BCNC surgery was conducted at 6 weeks old (designated as natal-labeled rats). Adult SD rats underwent BCNC surgery and EdU injection (50 ug/g, once) after surgery (designated as adult-labeled rats). One week after surgery, both natal- and adult-labeled rats received daily VED treatment for 4 weeks. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured for all rats and then the penile tissue was harvested. The ratio of ICP/MAP was calculated to represent erectile function. Penile tissue was examined by immunofluorescence staining to detect EdU positive cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ratio of Intracavernous pressure (ICP) /MAP and the percentage of EdU positive cells were measured. RESULTS: The erectile function was impaired after BCNC and partially restored after VED treatment in both natal- and adult-labeled rats (P < .05). There was no difference in the percentage of EdU positive cells in natal-labeled rat cavernous tissue in BCNC group compared with VED group. Among the adult-labeled rats, the percentage of EdU positive cells increased in BCNC group (P < .05) but didn't change significantly after VED treatment (P = .35). CONCLUSION: LRCs may play a limited role in the restoration of erectile dysfunction through VED treatment after BCNC. Yang B, Luse D, Cao Y, et al.

Clinical Comparison of Screw-Retained and Screwless Morse Taper Implant-Abutment Connections: One-year Postloading Results.,Geckili E; Geckili O; Bilhan H; Kutay O; Bilgin T,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to clinically evaluate the screwless Morse taper implant-abutment connection type, in which the retention screw is totally eliminated, in terms of stability, success, periodontal parameters, and marginal bone levels after 1 year of function by comparing it with a passive fit internal implant-abutment connection, wherein a space exists between the matching components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each edentulous subject received an implant with a screwless Morse taper connection (MT) in the left canine area of the mandible and an implant with a screw-retained implant-abutment connection (SR) in the right canine area of the mandible. All implants were loaded 6 weeks later. All cases were restored with a cemented bar-retained mandibular overdenture opposing a maxillary complete denture. Clinical recalls at 6 months and 12 months postloading were scheduled and the MT and SR implants were compared in terms of success, survival, primary and secondary implant stability, marginal bone loss, soft tissue response, and mechanical complications. The results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 20 subjects were included (10 females, 10 males; average age: 61.60 years) and a total of 40 implants were inserted. No implant failure or technical problem was detected for either MT or SR implants. Marginal bone loss around MT and SR implants did not show any significant differences at 6 weeks after surgery (time of loading) or at 6 months or 12 months postloading (P > .05). Periodontal parameters such as gingival index and probing pocket depth of MT and SR implants likewise did not differ significantly at 6 months and 12 months postloading (P > .05). Primary stability values of MT and SR implants did not differ significantly when measured with the insertion torque device (mean of 68.10 Ncm for MT and 64.20 Ncm for SR implants; P = .564), nor when measured with the electronic percussive testing device (mean of -5.30 for the MT and -5.35 for the SR implants; P = .398). However, MT implants showed lower stability at the time of loading (6 weeks) and 6 months postloading (P = .037 and P = .003, respectively). Stability values did not show any significant differences 12 months postloading (P > .05).

"Measuring extended families over time in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya: Retention and data consistency in a two-round survey.",Madhavan S; Beguy D; Clark S; Kabiru C,"BACKGROUND: Researchers have increasingly turned to longitudinal data to understand how the family environment of children changes over time and how this change affects their well-being. While the value of such efforts is clear, the inherent challenges of collecting robust data over time may limit or bias our understanding of family complexity. OBJECTIVE: Drawing on data from an exploratory study on kinship structure and support for low income single mothers and their young children in Nairobi, Kenya, this paper aims to (1) assess the strengths and weaknesses of our approach in reflecting the complexities of kinship dynamics and (2) analyze how methodological issues such as selection and reporting inconsistency can influence our understanding of the role of kin in children's lives. METHODS: The analysis used data from two waves of the Kinship Support Tree (KST) project. The starting sample consisted of 462 single mothers with at least one child under the age of 7, with data collected on approximately 5,000 resident and nonresident kin. Descriptive statistics and conventional tests of significance were used to analyze selection factors and inconsistencies in reporting across waves. RESULTS: The study yielded a 91% retention rate after six months and the analysis provides some assurance that selectivity from attrition and reporting inconsistency are not entirely driven by shifts in support provision by kin. However, the selectivity of the sample underscores caution in generalizing the results. CONCLUSIONS: While the challenges of conducting follow-up surveys such as the KST are serious, these findings suggest that it is possible to collect consistent data on kinship structure and support from the perspective of children in a mobile population. Tracking kinship structure over time using the KST is not only feasible but more importantly is unlikely to lead to incomplete or biased understanding of kinship. CONTRIBUTION: After further testing with a wider range of women, we hope to disseminate our results for use in a wide range of contexts both in and out of Africa. We believe this data is vital to designing appropriate interventions to improve the well-being of children growing up in these communities.",2018,Jan-Jun,Demogr Res,38,,1339-1358,,10.4054/DemRes.2018.38.44,29706796,#760,Madhavan 2018,"",""
[Application of bone-retaining femoral stem prosthesis in young patients with Dorr C femoral medullary cavity].,Liu J; Qu T; Li XS; Jia BL; Zhen P; Li YJ; Tian Q; Wang W; He XL,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical efficacy of Tri-Lock bio-short prosthesis in artificial total hip arthroplasty(THA) in young patients with Dorr type C femoral medullary cavity. METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2014, 35 young patients(37 hips) with in the chimney-like femoral medullary cavity received Tri-Lock BPS prosthesis of THA, including 18 males(20 hips) and 17 females with an average age of (32.2±3.0) years old ranging from 21.2 to 38.5 years old. There were 16 cases of rheumatoid hip arthritis (17 hips), 8 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (9 hips), and 11 cases of aseptic necrosis of femoral head (11 hips). All cases were complicated with different degrees of osteoporosis. According to Singh index, 26 cases were classified as Grade III and 9 cases as Grade II. Biological prostheses were used for the acetabulum, with ceramic lining and full ceramic femoral head. The proximal femoral medullary cavity was Dorr type C on anteroposterior X-ray. After replacement, X-ray examination was performed to locate the prosthesis stem. Engh and Harris criteria were used to evaluate the stability of bone-prosthesis interface and hip function, respectively. Changes of hip movement pre-operation and at last follow-up were compared. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 18 to 45 months(means 33.8 months). Harris hip scores in 35 cases (37 hips) increased significantly from preoperative 61.8±3.0 (51.2 to 73.5) to 93.3±6.5 (92.5 to 98.8) points at last follow-up (t=54.745, P<0.01). The hip mobility increased from (46.5±8.0)°(0° to 55°) before surgery to(101.2±10.5)°(85° to 130°) at the last follow-up, the difference was statistically significant(t=133.091, P<0.01). Immediately after surgery, the prostheses were tightly packed with the medullary cavity. At the final follow-up, 17 hips had significant femur cortical bone thickening;12 hips had varying degrees of stress occlusal bone resorption at proximal femoral, including 9 degree I(low femur density, round and blunt) and 3 degree II(involving small rotor) hips. Meanwhile, 15 hips had significant femur cortical bone thickening without thigh pain. CONCLUSIONS: The cone-shaped short Tri-lock biological short-stem can fill Dorr C chimney-like medullary cavity and effectively retain good proximal femoral bone mass. Titanium microporous coating on the surface can effectively increase the friction of the prosthesis.

METHODS: Twelve patients aged between 40 and 65 years with severe tooth attrition were recruited in this study. The experimental group (6 cases, 3 females and 3 males) used the method of digital copy of temporary restoration shape when making the final restoration, and the control group (6 cases, 3 females and 3 males) used the traditional method to make the final restoration. The mean time of central occlusal adjustment and protrusive and lateral occlusal adjustment of each crown, the number of follow-up visits of the patients were recorded and statistically analyzed. The occlusal comfort of the first and the third months after wearing the prosthesis was evaluated by the patients, and the difference of the occlusal comfort of the final prosthesis made by the two methods was compared (the full score was 10 points). The occlusal adjustment time and occlusal comfort score were used as measurement data. Single sample t test was used. The number of follow-up visits was count data.

The only effective treatment is the surgical procedure of manual removal of placenta, which is costly, requires skilled staff, requires an operative environment and is unpleasant for women. Small studies suggest that glyceryl trinitrate may be an effective medical alternative. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate spray compared with placebo in reducing the need for manual removal of placenta in women with retained placenta after vaginal delivery following the failure of current management. DESIGN: A group-sequential randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: There were 29 obstetric units in the UK involved in the study. PARTICIPANTS: There were 1107 women (glyceryl trinitrate group, n = 543; placebo group, n = 564) randomised between October 2014 and July 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Glyceryl trinitrate spray was administered to 541 women in the intervention group, and a placebo was administered to 563 women in the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four primary outcomes were defined: (1) clinical - the need for manual removal of placenta, (2) safety - measured blood loss, (3) patient sided - satisfaction with treatment and side effects and (4) economic - cost-effectiveness of both treatments using the UK NHS perspective. Secondary clinical outcomes included a > 15% decrease in haemoglobin level, time from randomisation to delivery of placenta in theatre, the need for earlier manual removal of placenta than planned, increase in heart rate or decrease in blood pressure, requirement for blood transfusion, requirement for general anaesthesia, maternal pyrexia, and sustained uterine relaxation requiring additional uterotonics. RESULTS: No difference was observed between the glyceryl trinitrate group and the control group for the placenta remaining undelivered within 15 minutes of study treatment (93.3% vs. 92%; odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.04; p = 0.393). There was no difference in blood loss of > 1000 ml between the glyceryl trinitrate group and the control group (22.2% vs. 15.5%; odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.48; p = 0.314). Palpitations were more common in the glyceryl trinitrate group than in the control group after taking the study drug (9.8% vs. 4.0%; odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 4.84; p = 0.003). There was no difference in any other measures of patient satisfaction between the groups. There was no difference in costs to the health service between groups (mean difference £55.30, 95% confidence interval -£199.20 to £309.79). Secondary outcomes revealed that a fall in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or an increase in heart rate, was more common in the glyceryl trinitrate group than in the control group (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 3.7 to 6.4; p < 0.001). The need for a blood transfusion was also more common in the glyceryl trinitrate group than in the control group (odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.25; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Glyceryl trinitrate spray did not increase the delivery of retained placenta within 15 minutes of administration when compared with the placebo, and was not cost-effective for medical management of retained placenta. More participants reported palpitations and required a blood transfusion in the glyceryl trinitrate group.

Survival rate and complication-free survival rate of implant-retained prostheses in the oral rehabilitation of patients with head and neck cancer: A retrospective evaluation of a cohort from a regional service.,Laverty DP; Addison O; Sharma P; Newsum D; Bateman G,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Literature reporting on the prosthetic survival and complications of implant-retained prostheses in patients with head and neck cancer is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to present the survival rates and complication-free survival rates of both fixed and removable implant-retained oral prostheses in patients with head and neck cancer while also reporting on the frequency and causes of failure and complications for each prosthesis type. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the prosthetic survival rates and complication-free survival rates of implant-retained oral prostheses and the frequency and causes of failure and complications in patients with head and neck cancer treated in a regional unit from 2012 to 2017 was performed. Differences in categorical and continuous data were assessed for statistical significance by using the Pearson chi-squared test, Fisher exact test, t test, and analysis of variance as appropriate. Cox proportional hazard regression models were fitted to evaluate the association between prostheses type, clinical and medical factors, and the outcomes of survival and complication-free survival. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the frequency and type of prosthetic complications. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 153 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer who had completed implant-retained prosthodontic rehabilitation and had been provided with 221 prostheses. The 5-year survival rate was 87% for maxillary fixed prostheses, 79% for mandibular fixed, 66% for maxillary removable, and 50% for mandibular removable. Hazard ratios were calculated showing that the 5-year survival rate of a mandibular removable prosthesis (HR=5.1; 95% CI 1.60-16.25) (P=.006) was greater than that of a maxillary fixed prosthesis (HR=1.0). The 5-year complication-free survival rate was highest for mandibular fixed prostheses (62%), followed by maxillary fixed (58%), maxillary removable (36%), and mandibular removable prostheses (29%). Hazard ratios showed that the 5-year survival rate of maxillary removable (HR=1.91; 95% CI 1.01-3.66) (P=.048) and mandibular removable prosthesis (HR=2.29; 95% CI 1.23-4.25) (P=.009) was greater than that of a maxillary fixed prosthesis (HR=1.0). Variables of radiotherapy, grafting, age, and sex and their influence on the survival rate and complication-free survival rate were assessed but were not statistically significant.

Attrition of MSM with HIV/AIDS along the continuum of care from screening to CD4 testing in China.,Zhang D; Li C; Meng S; Qi J; Fu X; Sun J,"The aim of this study is to describe attrition of newly diagnosed men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV/AIDS from screening to CD4 testing and provide suggestions to improve HIV case management in China. Data from 15 China-Gates Program project cities were collected on number of MSM who underwent each step from HIV screening to CD4 testing. Descriptive statistics were calculated. A total of 76,628 HIV screening tests were performed among MSM, of which 4563 were HIV-positive. Most attrition occurred at confirmatory and CD4 testing. Within the same year, 21% (1065/4063) of MSM who screened HIV-positive did not receive confirmatory testing and 34% (1025/3024) of MSM newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS did not receive CD4 testing. Marked differences were observed between project areas in attrition at these points of the care continuum. Marked differences were also observed across areas in the rate of CD4 counts <350 cells/mcl, ranging from 23% to 87%.

Alterations in the sperm histone-retained epigenome are associated with unexplained male factor infertility and poor blastocyst development in donor oocyte IVF cycles.,Denomme MM; McCallie BR; Parks JC; Schoolcraft WB; Katz-Jaffe MG,"STUDY QUESTION: Is there a distinct sperm histone-retained epigenetic signature in unexplained male factor infertility patients resulting in compromised blastocyst development? SUMMARY ANSWER: Using only donor oocyte IVF cycles, sperm DNA methylation patterns and miRNA profiles were significantly altered in normozoospermic patients resulting in poor blastocyst development, reflecting a subset of unexplained male factor infertility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Aberrant sperm DNA methylation has been associated with known male factor infertility, particularly noted in oligozoospermic patients. Unexplained male factor infertility remains a significant proportion of in vitro fertilization failures having unknown underlying physiology. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Sperm samples (n = 40) and blastocysts (n = 48) were obtained during fertile donor oocyte IVF cycles with normozoospermic parameters, thereby excluding known female and male infertility factors. Samples were divided into two groups based on blastocyst development (Good Group = ≥20% embryos with D5 grade 'AA' blastocysts, and ≥60% embryos of transferable quality on D5 and D6; Poor Group = ≤10% embryos with D5 grade 'AA' blastocysts, and ≤40% embryos of transferable quality on D5 and D6). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Samples were obtained from patients undergoing IVF treatments with informed consent and institutional review board approval. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip microarray was used to identify histone-retained CpG island genes and genomic regions showing differences in sperm DNA methylation between the Good Group and the Poor Group. Pathway and gene network analysis for the significantly altered genes was performed, and targeted DNA methylation validation was completed for 23 genes and two imprinting control regions. Sperm miRNA profiles were assessed using the TaqMan® Human MicroRNA Array Card, with corresponding blastocyst mRNA gene expression examined by qRT-PCR. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Our study is the first to investigate unexplained male factor infertility while significantly eliminating confounding female factors from our sample population by using only young fertile donor oocytes. We identified 1634 CpG sites located at retained histone CpG island regions that had significant sperm DNA methylation differentials between the two embryogenesis groups (P < 0.05). A largely hypermethylated profile was evident in the Good Group, with a small but distinct and statistically significant shift (P < 0.05) observed in the Poor Group. Genes involved in embryonic development were highly represented among histone-retained CpG sites with decreased methylation in the Poor Group (P < 0.05). Ten significantly altered sperm miRNAs (P < 0.05), correlated with altered target gene mRNA expression in the blastocysts from the Poor Group (P < 0.05). Taken together, significantly impacted sperm miRNA and target transcript levels in blastocysts from the Poor Group may contribute alongside aberrant sperm DNA methylation to the compromised blastocyst development observed. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our examination of CpG island regions restricted to retained histones represents only a small part of the sperm epigenome. The results observed are descriptive and further studies are needed to elucidate the functional effects of differential sperm DNA methylation on unexplained male factor infertility and blastocyst development. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Slight epigenetic changes in sperm may have a cumulative effect on fertility and embryonic developmental competence. Knowledge of sperm epigenetics and inheritance has important implications for future generations, while providing evidence for potential causes of unexplained male factor infertility.

The purpose of our study is to examine the impact of research productivity (h-index, m-index, publications, citations), professional degrees (PhD, MPH, MBA), leadership positions (program director, division chief, chairman), and faculty demographics (gender, nationality of training) on attaining NIH grant funding among pain medicine faculty. Methods A complete list of 98 civilian pain medicine programs was included in the study. Between September 1, 2022, and December 30, 2022, departmental websites were accessed to accrue a list of pain medicine faculty listings. Publicly available information was used to extract research productivities, professional degrees, leadership positions, faculty demographics, and NIH grant funding. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis, with NIH funding status as the primary outcome. Results A total of 696 pain physicians within the academic community were identified. Markers of research productivity such as a higher h- or m-index, larger number of publications and citations, PhD status, and being senior faculty (full professor, division chief, or chairman) were independently associated with NIH funding.

Comparison of the effect of different extubation techniques on extubation in patients with mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit,Zhao R.; ; Liu Y.; Huang Y.; Gao H.; Huang D.,"Objective To compare the application effects of three different extubation techniques in patients with mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Mechanical ventilation patients admitted to the critical care department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from July to November 2023 were enrolled. According to the random number table generated by Excel, the patients were divided into negative pressure group, positive pressure group 1 and positive pressure group 2, with 45 cases in each group. On the basis of routine nursing, the negative pressure group used the negative pressure extubation technique to remove the tracheal catheter. In the positive pressure group, the pressure support (PS) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of the positive pressure group 1 were 7 cmH<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>O (1 cmH<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>O=0.098 kPa) and 5 cmH<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>O, and the PS and PEEP of the positive pressure group 2 were 15 cmH<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>O and 10 cmH<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf>O. The main outcome measures were extubation related complications, including tachypnea, severe cough, sore throat, upper airway obstruction spasm, extubation failure, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia. The secondary outcome measures were the variation of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and blood oxygen saturation before and 1, 15 and 30 minutes after extubation. Results Finally, 42 patients were included in each group. There were no significant differences in gender, age, catheter retention days, duration of mechanical ventilation, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII), catheter model and diagnosis among the three groups, which were comparable. There were statistically significant differences in the incidence of tachypnea, severe cough, sore throat, upper airway obstruction spasm, hypoxemia and hypercapnia among the three groups, while there was no statistically significant difference in the failure rate of extubation. The incidence of tachypnea, severe cough, sore throat, upper airway obstruction spasm, hypoxemia and hypercapnia after extubation in positive pressure group 1 and positive pressure group 2 were lower than those in negative pressure group (7.14%, 9.52% vs. 33.33%; 7.14%, 4.76% vs. 28.57%; 61.90%, 52.38% vs. 88.10%; 11.90%, 19.05% vs. 45.24%; 7.14%, 7.14% vs. 30.95%; 4.76%, 2.38% vs. 28.57%; all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in extubation related complications between group 1 and group 2. There were significant differences in the time effect of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and blood oxygen saturation 30 minutes after extubation among three groups (F values were 145.792, 49.749, 22.486, 23.622 and 242.664, respectively, all P < 0.01). The intergroup effect of blood oxygen saturation was statistically significant (F = 3.835, P = 0.024), and the blood oxygen saturation in positive pressure group 1 and positive pressure group 2 were higher than those in negative pressure group 1 minute and 30 minutes after extubation (1 minute after extubation: 0.97+/-0.02, 0.97+/-0.02 vs. 0.95+/-0.02; 30 minutes after extubation: 1.00+/-0.01, 1.00+/-0.01 vs. 0.99+/-0.02, all P < 0.05). The interaction effects of heart rate and blood oxygen saturation were statistically significant (F values were 3.512 and 7.226, respectively, both P < 0.01). Conclusions Compared with negative pressure extubation, positive pressure extubation can effectively reduce extubation related complications in ICU mechanically ventilated patients. It is beneficial to maintain stable blood oxygen saturation within 30 minutes after extubation, and has better clinical application effects. It is recommended to use low pressure extubation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Chinese Medical Association.",2024,/,Chinese Critical Care Medicine,36,11,1157EP  - 1162,2036218963,https://dx.doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20231107-00950,39697020,#770,Zhao 2024,"",""

Evaluating Factors Impacting National Institutes of Health Funding in Pain Medicine,Kurian C.; ; Kurian E.; Orhurhu V.; Shen S.; Korn E.; Houle T.; Mueller A.,"Introduction: While many medical specialties have established links between bibliometric indices, academic rank, leadership roles and NIH funding, there exists a gap within the field of pain medicine. The purpose of our study is to examine the impact of research productivity metrics, professional degrees, leadership positions, and faculty demographics on attaining NIH grant funding among pain medicine faculty. We aim to identify variables having a greater impact on attaining NIH funding, in an effort to advance the next generation of pain physicians and the field of pain medicine as a whole. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Our study was designed as a retrospective case control study. Using the AMA FREIDA database, a list of 98 civilian academic pain medicine fellowship programs were procured. From their departmental websites, a total of 696 pain medicine faculty and their respective academic rank, degrees, and positions were obtained. Through the Scopus database, we collected faculty h-index, total citations, duration of research career, and total publications. We then utilized the RePORTER module to obtain active and non-active NIH funded research projects and grant size. The data was analyzed using a hurdle model to estimate the probability of receiving NIH funding, conditional on the aforementioned variables. Results of the hurdle model were evaluated using two-sided p-values, with values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All of the 696 pain medicine faculty were included in the study. Our criteria excluded non-physicians and four military-based programs. With adjustment for pre-specified variables, there was no significant difference between the sexes in receiving NIH funding (p = 0.892). Additionally, among those who had received funding, there was no notable difference in the monetary amount given between the sexes (p = 0.360). A per point increase in H-index was statistically significant for increasing the odds of receiving NIH funding by 9% (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the amount of NIH funding received regardless of a faculty member's H-index (p=0.110). The NIH funded group was found to have a higher median M-index, higher median publications, and higher median citations. Holders of a PhD degree had an approximate 10-fold increase in the probability of receiving NIH funding (p <0.01). Senior faculty, including associate or full professors, saw roughly a 5-fold increase in the probability of receiving NIH funding (p <0.01). Limitations for our study include h-index inflation, lack of verified self-identification, and inaccurate online listings. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Markers of research productivity such as a higher h- or m-index, larger number of publications and citations, PhD status, and being senior faculty were independently associated with NIH funding. While there are signs of improved NIH funding opportunities for female pain physicians, there exists a need to explore other barriers which could be prohibiting certain researchers. Overall, these identified variables may be employed to better hire, promote, and retain chronic pain faculty.

Social capital as a catalyst for gender inequality: A scoping review of networking disparities in academic medicine,Callander J.K.; ; Johnson D.E.; Grandis J.R.,"Gender disparities in academic medicine persist despite gender parity among medical school graduates. Women remain underrepresented in higher academic ranks and leadership roles, with significant differences in retention, promotion, and compensation. In this scoping review, the authors explore the role of networking and social capital in exacerbating these disparities. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of networking in obtaining leadership roles, decreasing social isolation, and enhancing retention. Sponsorship, distinct from mentorship, is vital for career development and has a direct impact on professional growth. However, women are often under-sponsored compared with men, limiting their access to influential networks. In addition, virtual networking platforms and women-focused organizations offer promising alternatives to traditional, male-dominated networking activities. Despite the progress made, informal networking practices and gender biases continue to exclude women from key opportunities. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at enhancing the social capital of women in academic medicine to help close the gender gap. Proposed interventions prime for further evaluation include the implementation of formal sponsorship programs, the development of structured networking opportunities, and the promotion of women-focused organizations.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Cancer Society.",2024,/,Cancer,,"(Callander, Johnson, Grandis) Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States",,2032450629,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cncr.35667,,#775,Callander 2024,"",""

Sex-Based Performance Disparities in Machine Learning Algorithms for Cardiac Disease Prediction: Exploratory Study,Straw I.; ; Rees G.; Nachev P.,"Background: The presence of bias in artificial intelligence has garnered increased attention, with inequities in algorithmic performance being exposed across the fields of criminal justice, education, and welfare services. In health care, the inequitable performance of algorithms across demographic groups may widen health inequalities. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Here, we identify and characterize bias in cardiology algorithms, looking specifically at algorithms used in the management of heart failure. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Stage 1 involved a literature search of PubMed and Web of Science for key terms relating to cardiac machine learning (ML) algorithms. Papers that built ML models to predict cardiac disease were evaluated for their focus on demographic bias in model performance, and open-source data sets were retained for our investigation. Two open-source data sets were identified: (1) the University of California Irvine Heart Failure data set and (2) the University of California Irvine Coronary Artery Disease data set. We reproduced existing algorithms that have been reported for these data sets, tested them for sex biases in algorithm performance, and assessed a range of remediation techniques for their efficacy in reducing inequities. Particular attention was paid to the false negative rate (FNR), due to the clinical significance of underdiagnosis and missed opportunities for treatment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In stage 1, our literature search returned 127 papers, with 60 meeting the criteria for a full review and only 3 papers highlighting sex differences in algorithm performance. In the papers that reported sex, there was a consistent underrepresentation of female patients in the data sets. No papers investigated racial or ethnic differences. In stage 2, we reproduced algorithms reported in the literature, achieving mean accuracies of 84.24% (SD 3.51%) for data set 1 and 85.72% (SD 1.75%) for data set 2 (random forest models). For data set 1, the FNR was significantly higher for female patients in 13 out of 16 experiments, meeting the threshold of statistical significance (-17.81% to -3.37%; P<.05). A smaller disparity in the false positive rate was significant for male patients in 13 out of 16 experiments (-0.48% to +9.77%; P<.05). We observed an overprediction of disease for male patients (higher false positive rate) and an underprediction of disease for female patients (higher FNR). Sex differences in feature importance suggest that feature selection needs to be demographically tailored. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our research exposes a significant gap in cardiac ML research, highlighting that the underperformance of algorithms for female patients has been overlooked in the published literature. Our study quantifies sex disparities in algorithmic performance and explores several sources of bias. We found an underrepresentation of female patients in the data sets used to train algorithms, identified sex biases in model error rates, and demonstrated that a series of remediation techniques were unable to address the inequities present.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9;Isabel Straw, Geraint Rees, Parashkev Nachev.",2024,/,Journal of Medical Internet Research,26,1,e46936,2034259966,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/46936,39186324,#783,Straw 2024,"",""
A Quiz as an Academic Tool for Teaching Learning Physiology in Indian Medical Students: A Cross Sectional Study,Gupta S.K.; ; Singh R.; Singh R.K.,"Background: In medical education, innovative teaching methods are essential to enhance knowledge retention and practical application. Quizzes have emerged as a valuable tool in reinforcing learning through active engagement and immediate feedback, particularly in complex subjects such as Physiology. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of quizzes as an academic tool in teaching Physiology to Indian medical students at Patna Medical College and Hospital, Patna. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants were administered a series of quizzes covering various Physiology topics. Data on quiz scores, demographic information, and previous academic performance were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 to compare quiz scores across different groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The average quiz score was 72.5 +/- 10.3, with scores ranging from 50 to 95. No significant gender differences in quiz scores were observed (p = 0.089). Previous academic performance significantly influenced quiz scores, with high performers scoring higher (78.5 +/- 8.6) than medium (70.4 +/- 10.2) and low performers (66.8 +/- 9.7) (p < 0.01). Age did not significantly correlate with quiz scores (r = 0.15, p = 0.18). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Quizzes are an effective tool for enhancing learning and understanding of Physiology among medical students. While previous academic performance impacts quiz scores, gender and age do not significantly influence outcomes. Recommendations: Incorporating quizzes into the medical curriculum can provide ongoing assessment and reinforce learning. Further research should explore the long-term benefits and potential integration of quizzes into other areas of medical education.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Dr. Yashwant Research Labs Pvt.

The Landscape of Pain Medicine for Women Physicians: A Perspective,Jankelovits A.; ; Chow R.M.; Rana P.; Rajput K.,"Background: The gender bias in academic anesthesiology is well known. Women are not only a minority in the field but also underrepresented in leadership positions. Reported reasons for this underrepresentation include barriers to career advancement, lack of mentorship, and differences in compensation, among others. Interventional pain, a competitive procedural subspecialty of anesthesiology, sees the trickle-down effects of this disparity. According to a report from the ACGME that sorted medical subspecialties by number of female trainees, pain medicine ranked in the bottom quartile across all disciplines from 2008-2016. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To better understand the landscape for women physicians in the field of pain medicine, we undertook this investigation to review the knowledge about the topic and what questions remain unanswered. <ovid:br/>Study Design: This study is a review of the current literature and aims to summarize and describe the landscape of pain medicine for women physicians. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): All literature review and manuscript preparation took place at the Yale University School of Medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a comprehensive search using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases for the combined terms ""gender disparity,"" ""pain medicine,"" and ""anesthesiology,"" limiting our search to the year 2000 onward for the most recent literature on the topic. Our initial search retrieved 38 articles. All relevant articles pertaining to this perspective piece were collated. The available literature is discussed below. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Women are underrepresented in interventional pain. The grim scarcity of female pain physicians is unlikely to improve soon, since while the number of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education pain fellowship programs continues to grow, women trainees comprise only between 22-25% of all pain medicine fellows. Additionally, although studies have compared the numbers of male interventional pain faculty to their female counterparts in academic hospitals and shown the ratio to range from 71.84-82% to 18-28.52%, respectively, no studies have truly explored the landscape for women physicians in private practice. Patients prefer and have better experiences with physicians who are racially and ethnically like themselves. In fact, the preference for and the lack of female clinicians have been associated with delayed pursuit of care and adverse health outcomes. The consequences of the burnout and attrition caused by the gender disparity, especially in a field like pain medicine, cannot be understated. <ovid:br/>Limitation(s): The review might not have been comprehensive, and relevant studies might not have been included. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While the gender disparity in academia is well documented for both anesthesiology and pain medicine, the reasons for this disparity have not been fully explored. Moreover, it is also unknown whether the minority of female physicians who select pain medicine as a subspecialty gravitate toward an academic or a private-practice path. To address the existing gender disparity, it is necessary to explore the landscape of interventional pain medicine in both academic and private practices and understand pain physicians' beliefs and sentiments regarding their subspecialty.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

Gender Differences in the Path to Medical School Deanship,Iyer M.S.; ; Bradford C.; Gottlieb A.S.; Kling D.B.; Jagsi R.; Mangurian C.; Marks L.; Meltzer C.C.; Overholser B.; Silver J.K.; Way D.P.; Spector N.D.,"Importance: Women account for only 28% of current US medical school deans. Studying the differences between women and men in their preparation to becoming deans might help to explain this discrepancy. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify differences in the leadership development experiences between women and men in their ascent to the medical school deanship. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): In this qualitative study, volunteers from the roster of the Association of American Medical Colleges Council of Deans were solicited and interviewed from June 15 to November 9, 2023. Women deans were recruited first, then men who had been appointed to their deanships at a similar time to their women counterparts were recruited. Deans were interviewed on topics related to number of applications for deanships, prior leadership roles, leadership development, personal factors, and career trajectories. Interviews were coded, and themes were extracted through conventional content analysis. Main Outcome and Measures: Career and leadership development experiences were elicited using a semistructured interview guide. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We interviewed 17 women and 17 men deans, representing 25.8% (34 of 132) of the total population of US medical school deans. Most deans (23 [67.6%]) practiced a medicine-based specialty or subspecialty. No statistically significant differences were found between women and men with regard to years to attain deanship (mean [SD], 2.7 [3.4] vs 3.7 [3.7] years), years as a dean (mean [SD], 5.7 [5.2] vs 6.0 [5.0] years), highest salary during career (mean [SD], $525769 [$199936] vs $416923 [$195848]), or medical school rankings (mean [SD], 315.5 [394.5] vs 480.5 [448.9]). Their reports indicated substantive gender differences in their paths to becoming a dean. Compared with men, women deans reported having to work harder to advance, while receiving less support and opportunities for leadership positions by their own institutions. Subsequently, women sought leadership development from external programs. Women deans also experienced gender bias when working with search firms. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study of US medical school deans found that compared with men, women needed to be more proactive, had to participate in external leadership development programs, and had to confront biases during the search process. For rising women leaders, this lack of support had consequences, such as burnout and attrition, potentially affecting the makeup of future generations of medical school deans. Institutional initiatives centering on leadership development of women is needed to mitigate the gender biases and barriers faced by aspiring women leaders.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Iyer MS et al.

Comparative analysis of gender disparity in academic positions based on U.S. region and STEM discipline,Galvin D.J.; ; Anderson S.C.; Marolf C.J.; Schneider N.G.; Liebl A.L.,"Despite a move toward gender parity in the United States (U.S.) workforce, a large gender gap persists in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); this is particularly true for academic (i.e., instructor and tenure track) STEM positions. This gap increases as women advance through the traditional steps of academia, with the highest degree of gender disparity in tenured positions. As policies, politics, and culture, which all contribute to gender equity across the world, vary across regions in the United States, we expect that the gender gap in STEM might also vary across geographic regions. Here, we evaluated over 20,000 instructor and tenure track positions in university STEM departments across the U.S. to evaluate whether and how the geographic region of a university might determine its proportion of women in STEM academic positions. Similar to previous research, regardless of geographic region, more men were employed in both tenure track and instructor positions across STEM fields. However, variation existed regionally within the U.S., with the Mountain region employing the lowest proportion of women in tenure track positions and the East North Central and Pacific regions employing the greatest proportion. We expect this regional variation could be caused by differences in state and local policies, regional representation, and mentorship, resulting in inconsistent support for women, leading to differences in work environments, hiring, and job retention rates across the country. A better understanding of which geographic areas within the U.S. have more equal distributions of women in the STEM field will help us to identify the specific mechanisms that facilitate more equal and inclusive opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups across all levels of STEM academia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Public Library of Science.

The urgency of restructuring the landscape of behavioral medicine: Commentary from early-career diversity institute scholars,Fowler L.A.; ; Quinones-Cordero M.M.; Sidani J.E.; Bernhart J.A.; Mendoza-Vasconez A.S.; Bannon S.M.; Unni E.J.,"Structural and systemic barriers entrenched in academia have sustained for decades, and resulted in a lack of diversity in leadership positions, inequitable workloads for women and underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and increasing issues with retention of faculty, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in higher education via legislation, policies, and general anti-DEI sentiment contextualizes the importance of prioritizing DEI.The goal of this commentary is to open discussion among academic institutions regarding changes in DEI culture that will facilitate the growth of diverse early-career faculty (ECF). We use an adapted framework which incorporates DEI into a faculty competency model to (i) guide our discussion of the rationale for restructuring academic systems to promote DEI and (ii) recommend strategies for institutional progress for ECF that can translate across academic institutions. Implementing policies and practices that seek to recruit, retain, and support historically underrepresented ECF are needed, and may involve faculty mentorship programs, establishing equitable funding mechanisms, reforming faculty evaluation practices, and examining and correcting inequities in faculty workloads. The onus is on institutions to recognize and replace the exclusionary practices and biases that have existed within their walls, and continuously promote and monitor their DEI efforts and initiatives to ensure their efficacy. Inclusive academic cultures that demonstrate their value of diversity and commitment to equity promotion at all levels of the organization, including among ECF, are necessary for ensuring excellence in scholarship in academia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Oxford University Press.

Gender trends in dentistry: Dental faculty and academic leadership,Kim A.; ; Karra N.; Song C.; Linder P.J.; Bonino F.; Doig P.; Zandona A.,"OBJECTIVES: Gender equality in the healthcare workforce has been a topic of discourse for many decades. In dental academia, women's representation of enrolled students and faculty has risen consistently since the 1980s. However, women in faculty leadership positions may still be lagging when compared to men. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of women who occupy the upper echelons of academic rank and title by analyzing cross-referenced data from the American Dental Association and the American Dental Education Association on women dental school graduates in relation to academic appointments. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Gender distribution in rank, title, and appointments in the decade from 2011 to 2019, as well as percentage of women graduates over the same period, were collected for descriptive statistics. Multiple linear regression analysis, Cochran Armitage, and chi-square tests were conducted to examine trends over the years and to determine significant differences in overall percentages (p < 0.05). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The total women faculty percentages ranged from 36% to 40%. While the lower-level rank of instructor retained a higher representation of women (56%-65%), the higher rank of professor had disproportionately lower women percentages (18%-26%). Graduates, full-time faculty, lower-level academic ranks, and higher-level academic ranks for women followed similar upward trends that were statistically significant (p < 0.05). When comparing the different groups against each other, the annual increase in women DMD/DDS graduate percentage was higher than women full-time faculty (0.28%), instructor rank (0.92%), professor rank (0.50%), and department chair appointments (0.49%). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our data show that women are still underrepresented at higher academic ranks.

Trends in female representation in cardiology and its subspecialties: The current state and the desired state,Naser A.; ; Puttur A.; Saleh S.; Ta'ani O.A.; Caudill A.; Radhakrishnan A.,"Introduction: Women have been historically underrepresented in Cardiology and its subspecialties. However, limited research has been done to examine the trends of representation of women in cardiology and its subspecialties over time.

We found a statistically significant increase in women's representation in cardiovascular disease and interventional cardiology. However, there was no statistically significant changes in the representation of women in electrophysiology and advanced heart failure. We have found over the last decade that there was a positive trend in overall women fellows choosing cardiology and its subspecialties, especially since 2018. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While strides have been made in increasing the number of female fellows in cardiology, it still lags compared to other internal medicine subspecialties.

Incidence of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Longitudinal Cohort of Older Adults,Kornblith E.; ; Diaz-Ramirez L.G.; Yaffe K.; Boscardin W.J.; Gardner R.C.,"Importance: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at the highest rate in older adulthood and increases risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To update existing TBI surveillance data to capture nonhospital settings and to explore how social determinants of health (SDOH) are associated with TBI incidence among older adults. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This nationally representative longitudinal cohort study assessed participants for 18 years, from August 2000 through December 2018, using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and linked Medicare claims dates. Analyses were completed August 9 through December 12, 2022. Participants were 65 years of age or older in the HRS with survey data linked to Medicare without a TBI prior to HRS enrollment. They were community dwelling at enrollment but were retained in HRS if they were later institutionalized. Exposures: Baseline demographic, cognitive, medical, and SDOH information from HRS. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident TBI was defined using inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes received the same day or within 1 day as the emergency department (ED) visit code and the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) code, after baseline HRS interview. A cohort with TBI codes but no ED visit or CT or MRI scan was derived to capture diagnoses in nonhospital settings. Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations of TBI with demographic and SDOH characteristics used sample weights. Fine-Gray regression models estimated associations between covariates and TBI, with death as a competing risk. Imputation considering outcome and complex survey design was performed by race and ethnicity, sex, education level, and Area Deprivation Index percentiles 1, 50, and 100.

Mean (SD) baseline age was 75.2 (8.0) years. During follow-up (18 years), 797 (8.9%) of respondents received an incident TBI diagnosis with an ED visit and a CT code within 1 day, 964 (10.2%) received an incident TBI diagnosis and an ED code, and 1148 (12.9%) received a TBI code with or without an ED visit and CT scan code. Compared with respondents without incident TBI, respondents with TBI were more likely to be female (absolute difference, 7.0 [95% CI, 3.3-10.8]; P <.001) and White (absolute difference, 5.1 [95% CI, 2.8-7.4]; P <.001), have normal cognition (vs cognitive impairment or dementia; absolute difference, 6.1 [95% CI, 2.8-9.3]; P =.001), higher education (absolute difference, 3.8 [95% CI, 0.9-6.7]; P <.001), and wealth (absolute difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 2.3-10.7]; P =.01), and be without baseline lung disease (absolute difference, 5.1 [95% CI, 3.0-7.2]; P <.001) or functional impairment (absolute difference, 3.3 [95% CI, 0.4-6.1]; P =.03). In adjusted multivariate models, lower education (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.57-0.94]; P =.01), Black race (SHR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.46-0.80]; P <.001), area deprivation index national rank (SHR 1.00 [95% CI 0.99-1.00]; P =.009), and male sex (SHR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.94]; P =.02) were associated with membership in the group without TBI.

ASSESSING BARRIERS TO AN EQUITABLE ACADEMIC WORKFORCE: INSIGHTS FROM A NATIONAL ACC FIT/EC SURVEY,Tapaskar N.; ; Theriot P.; Velagapudi P.; Cullen M.W.; Wiggins N.; Bharadwaj A.S.; Yong C.M.,"Background Women cardiologists remain underrepresented in academic medicine. The personal, institutional, and systemic contributors to academic career attrition by gender are not well understood. Methods The American College of Cardiology (ACC) emailed a 39-question survey to Fellow-in-Training (FIT) and Early Career (EC) members between August 18-September 15, 2023. A Z-test of column proportions analyzed the results. Results A total of 617 respondents completed the survey (60% FIT, 40% EC, 76% male, 47% Non-Hispanic White, 16% response rate). 52% of FITs intended a career in academic medicine, and 36% of ECs practiced at university-affiliated centers. Respondents spent an average of 60.6 hours per week working, with no significant differences by gender.

IMPLEMENTATION OF UPSTANDER TRAINING CURRICULUM IN GASTROENTEROLOGY FELLOWSHIP,Voth E.; ; Gala K.; Simonetto D.; Wang X.J.,"Background: The field of medicine has demonstrated growing acknowledgement and increased awareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Despite these efforts, women and underrepresented minorities (URM) in medicine still face frequent challenges in the form of microaggressions. Upstander training- how to recognize and respond to microaggressions and bias in support of the victim- is underutilized in graduate medical education as part of a Equity, Inclusivity, and Diversity (EID) curriculum. We implemented Upstander Training in our gastroenterology (GI) fellowship as part of a core curriculum conference, with a case-based approach and open discussion on shared experiences. The aim of this educational initiative is to develop an interactive curriculum relevant to physician trainees in an effort to promote a flourishing and diverse physician work force. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a didactic session for all fellows in our general and 4<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> year GI fellowship programs. We specifically geared our cases towards clinical encounters faced by GI fellows, including one example in the general GI clinic and two in the inpatient setting. These were conducted in an open forum style, with the session leaders soliciting responses and opinions to these case-based situations from the audience. Participants completed a survey before and after the workshop. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The majority of participants had either suffered or witnessed discrimination at some point during their medical training (64.3%; 78.6%). Among our cohort, 6/7 (85.7%) of women reported facing discrimination, and 6/8 (75.0%) of those identifying with a racial minority had a personal experience of discrimination. The majority of participants enjoyed the session, felt that it was useful to fellows, and wanted this training to be conducted annually. In particular, 88.8% (8) of participants strongly agreed that the interactive cases were beneficial to their learning. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The prevalence of microaggressions toward URM and women in medicine requires institutional support and ongoing efforts to address systemic inequities in medicine, as they are associated with increased physician burnout, rates of depression, decreased performance, and poor job satisfaction. Additionally, in order to increase diversity in the pipeline of academic medicine, we must focus efforts on retaining our women and URM physicians. The effective utilization of upstander training is an important tool to empower physician trainees in becoming an ally when microaggressions occur in an effort to promote a culture of diversity and inclusivity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 AGA Institute",2024,/,Gastroenterology,166,5 Supplement,SEP  - 939,2032013123,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085%2824%2902639-8,,#797,Voth 2024,"",""
Assessment of Sex Diversity Among Craniofacial Academic Faculty,Rivera J.C.; ; Hauc S.C.; Juan H.Y.; Williams M.; Stogner V.A.; Najafali D.; Long A.S.; Almeida M.; Persing J.A.; Alperovich M.,"Sex diversity among plastic surgery and its subspecialties faculties lags behind many medical specialties.

A significant difference (P-value <0.0001) was seen among male and female craniofacial surgery faculty with 84.6% males. Faculty members were further subdivided by academic rank. A significant difference was found between the number of male and female faculty members at all academic positions (P-value =0.043). Of 41 full professors, 2.4% were female. There were 42 associate professors queried with 14.3% female. Similarly, 43 assistant professors were identified with 32.0% female. Years in practice after completing terminal training were analyzed across the academic faculty. There was a significant difference in the number of male and female faculty members across all experience levels (P-value =0.0037). Among the faculty with <10 years since completion of terminal training, 32.4 % were female. For faculty with 10 to 20 years after post-terminal training, 19.6% were female. For those with 20 to 30 years of experience, 0% were female. Finally, for the faculty with over 30 years since graduation, 5.9% were female. Board membership in 2 craniofacial surgery organizations was analyzed: the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association and the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons. Among the 17 board members of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association, 8 (47.1%) were female. For the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons, 5 (35.7%) were female. Data were collected for 193 editorial board members from 2 craniofacial surgery journals. There was a significant difference between the number of male and female members across both journals (chi2 value: 33.3570; P-value <0.0001). Among 56 editorial board members from Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal, 26 (46.4%) members were female. In comparison, Journal of Craniofacial Surgery has 24.8% female editorial board members. Sex diversity among faculty members is really important and should be brought into light to highlight and improve areas of particular importance and of tremendous potential impact. Given our results, surgical residencies and fellowship programs should begin to show concrete commitment and increase their efforts to recruit and retain a diverse faculty not only for the educational benefit but more importantly to achieve a higher level of care for all.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by Mutaz B.

"Gendered Performance Gaps in an Upper-Division Biology Course: Academic, Demographic, Environmental, and Affective Factors",Farrar V.S.; ; Aguayo B.-Y.C.; Caporale N.,"Despite the existent gender parity in undergraduate biology degree attainment, gendered differences in outcomes are prevalent in introductory biology courses. Less is known about whether these disparities persist at the upper-division level, after most attrition is assumed to have occurred. Here, we report the consistent presence of gender equity gaps across 35 offerings (10 years) of a large-enrollment upper-division biology course at a research-intensive public university. Multilevel modeling showed that women's grades were lower than men's, regardless of prior GPA. These gender gaps were present even when controlling for students' race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first-generation college-going status, international status, and transfer status. Class size, gender representation in the classroom, and instructor gender did not significantly relate to course grades. Student questionnaires in a subset of offerings indicated gendered differences in course anxiety, science identity, and science self-efficacy, which correlated with grade outcomes. These results suggest that women experience differential outcomes in upper-division biology, which may negatively influence their persistence in STEM fields postgraduation. Our findings suggest that gender disparities are a systemic problem throughout the undergraduate biology degree and underscore the need for further examination and transformation of upper-division courses to support all students, even at late stages of their degrees.",2023,/,CBE life sciences education,22,4,ar52,642648694,https://dx.doi.org/10.1187/cbe.23-03-0041,37906692,#799,Farrar 2023,"",""
"Intersectionality and COVID-19: Academic Medicine Faculty's Lived Experiences of Well-Being, Workload, and Productivity During the Pandemic",Berge J.M.; ; Freese R.; Macheledt K.C.; Watson S.; Pusalavidyasagar S.; Kunin-Batson A.; Ghebre R.; Lingras K.; Church A.L.; Dwivedi R.; Nakib N.; McCarty C.A.; Misono S.; Rogers E.A.; Patel S.I.; Spencer S.,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to utilize an intersectional framework to examine academic faculty's lived experiences during COVID-19. Specifically, we set out to: (1) describe the multiple intersectional identities (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, rank, caregiver status, disability status) represented by the faculty, (2) examine potential disparities in well-being, workload, and productivity linked to these intersectional factors, and (3) identify qualitative themes endorsed by faculty as they relate to lived experiences during COVID-19. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a cross-sectional mixed-methods research study. The Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota developed and implemented a survey between February-June of 2021 in response to national reports of disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 291 full-time faculty who participated in the study. Quantitative findings indicated that faculty with multiple intersectional identities (e.g., woman+assistant professor+caregiver+underrepresented in medicine) reported greater depression symptoms, work/family conflict, and stress in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Furthermore, faculty with more intersectional identities reported higher clinical workloads and service responsibilities and lower productivity with regard to research article submissions, publications, and grant submissions in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Qualitative findings supported quantitative findings and broadened understanding of potential underlying reasons. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Findings confirm anecdotal evidence that faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections may be disproportionately experiencing negative outcomes from the pandemic. These findings caninform decisions about how to address these disparities moving into the next several years with regard to promotion and tenure, burnout and well-being, and faculty retention in academic medical settings. Given these findings, it is also important to intentionally plan responses for future public health crises to prevent continued disparities for faculty with multiple intersectional identities.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

Checking Our Blind Spots: Examining Characteristics of Interviewees Versus Matriculants to a Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgical Fellowship Program,Lund S.; ; MacArthur T.; Watkins R.; Alva-Ruiz R.; Thiels C.A.; Smoot R.L.; Cleary S.P.; Warner S.G.,"Objective: Racial and gender biases exist within academic surgery; bias negatively impacts patient care, reimbursement, student training, and staff retention. Few studies have investigated the potential for bias in surgical fellowship recruitment. We aimed to compare the racial and gender diversity at our hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery fellowship program to nationwide standards. We further aimed to investigate differences in the demographics of resident interviewees versus matriculants to our HPB fellowship. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Retrospective review. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): North American HPB fellowship training programs. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Mayo Clinic's HPB surgery fellowship interviewees and North American HPB surgery fellowship graduates from 2013 to 2020. <ovid:br/>Result(s): When compared to general surgery residency graduates during the study period (in 2019), a lower proportion of North American HPB surgery fellowship graduates were female (26% HPB fellowship graduates vs. 43.1% residents, p = 0.005), with no difference in proportion of racially under-represented in medicine (rURM) HPB fellowship graduates (10.7%) compared to rURM proportion of general surgery residents nationally (14.5%). There was an upward trend in female representation among North American HPB fellowship graduates from 11% in 2013 to 32% in 2020, but proportions of rURM HPB fellows remained steadily low. When comparing HPB interviewees at our institution to national general surgery residents, no differences were observed in proportions of female (34.4% interviewees vs. 43.1% residents, p = 0.17) or rURM (interviewees = 6.8%, residents = 14.5%, p = 0.09) applicants. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the proportion of female or rURM interviewees and matriculants to our HPB program. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While fewer female graduating surgeons are pursuing HPB fellowship training than male graduates, this gender gap has narrowed over time. In contrast, the national percentage of rURM HPB fellowship graduates has remained low, mirroring stagnant proportions of rURM surgical residency graduates. When comparing HPB fellowship interviewees at our own institution to North American fellowship graduates, we observed similar proportions of female interviewees but lower proportions of rURM interviewees. Locally, these data will drive process change toward more intentional examination of our interview selection process.

Here, we explore gender-based differences in perceived competence and professionalism as described in an institutional electronic risk management reporting system. <ovid:br/>Design(s): In this retrospective qualitative study, recurring themes were identified from anonymous entries reported to an electronic institutional risk management database from July 2014 to July 2015, and from July 2019 to July 2020 using inductive methods. This electronic system is often used by hospital staff to document complaints against physicians under the pretext of poor patient care, regardless of whether an adverse event occurred. Two individuals independently coded entries. Themes were determined from event indicator codes (EIC) using Delphi methodology and compared between gender and specialty using bivariate statistics. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): A multi-center integrated healthcare delivery system. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Risk management entries pertaining to physician trainees by hospital staff as written submissions to the institution's electronic risk management reporting system. Main outcomes included themes defined as: (1) lack of professionalism (i.e., delay in response, attitude, lack of communication), (2) perceived medical error, (3) breach of institutional protocol. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 207 entries included for analysis, 52 entries identified men (25%) and 31 entries identified women (15%). The gender was not available in 124 entries and, therefore, categorized as ambiguous. The most common complaint about men involved a physician-related EIC (n = 12, 23%, EIC TX39) and the most common complaint about women involved a communication-related EIC (n = 7, 23%, EIC TX55). Eighty-eight (43%) entries involved medical trainees; 82 (40%) involved surgical trainees. Women were more often identified by their name only (n = 8, 26% vs. n = 3, 6%; p < 0.001).

Multimodal teaching methods for students in dentistry: a replacement for traditional teaching or a valuable addition? A three-year prospective cohort study,Gatt G.; ; Attard N.J.,"BACKGROUND: This student-centred prospective cohort study evaluated the impact of multimodal teaching methods on student performance in the theoretical domain of dental studies. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Dental students answered anonymous questionnaires indicating their preferences and opinions three times over three consecutive academic years. Data collected included gender, course, year of study and most frequent and preferred learning modality. Survey responses from Google Forms were analysed with SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA). Scale responses were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test against gender, program and year of study. Grades obtained from structured examinations held in the third academic year were analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test according to the teaching method employed. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The response rate was high (> 80%) throughout the study. Acceptance of online modalities increased over time (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001) and 75% of students requested that online teaching modalities be maintained. Significant differences in gender, program of study, year of study and discipline taught were observed (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05). Females differed from males by favouring online modalities and face-to-face lectures, respectively, and clinical year students opted to retain pre-recorded online lectures. Recorded lectures resulted better for teaching core knowledge (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, p = 0.034), while face-to-face lectures were better for teaching applied knowledge (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, p = 0.043). Student responses to open-ended questions identified the need for a blended approach with in-person lecturing as an opportunity to socialise and avoid mental health issues. Although preferences varied, students showed a willingness to influence their learning and changes in curriculum, a predilection for self-directed learning and the need for freedom in engaging with resources and content. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): In the context of this study, online teaching modalities resulted in comparable examination performance and improved student satisfaction. This highlights the need for a blended approach to teaching.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

Standard Adult Gastric Emptying Scintigraphy Criteria Is Applicable for Partial Meal Ingestion,Shah H.; ; Sundar R.; Prado D.E.A.; Dong J.W.; Chow D.Z.; Kuo B.; Voss S.D.; Jacene H.A.; Robertson M.S.; Ng T.S.C.,"Background/Aims: Gastric emptying scintigraphy is commonly performed to assess for dysmotility. A standardized meal with associated threshold criteria was established in 2000 to enable robust interpretation. However, no guidance is available to interpret results when patients do not ingest the entire meal. The purpose of this study is to determine the continued appropriateness of the threshold criteria in contemporary clinical practice and its relevance for partially ingested meals. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This retrospective study analyzed patients (n = 1365 total) who underwent solid-phase gastric emptying scintigraphy at an academic medical center. Patients were stratified based on their completion of the standard meal. Patients were further stratified into normal and delayed gastric emptying cohorts based on the current criteria. Percent gastric retention values at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h were compared. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Median (95% upper reference) normal gastric retention values for the complete standard meal were 64% (87%) at 1 h, 25% (60%) at 2 h, 13% (54%) at 3 h and 4% (9%) at 4 h. Consumption of at least 50% of the standard meal yielded similar retention; 53% (86%) at 1 h, 19% (58%) at 2 h, 6% (29%) at 3 h and 3% (10%) at 4 h. There was no significant age- or gender-specific differences using the current criteria, and no differences were observed based on diabetic status. Retention values matched well with the current criteria and validated with data-driven clustering. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Adult normative standards for gastric emptying scintigraphy are appropriate for differentiating normal and delayed populations and can be applied to partial meals with at least 50% completion.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,/,Digestive Diseases and Sciences,68,2,541EP  - 553,2018729477,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10620-022-07667-6,35995883,#805,Shah 2023,"",""

Increased research productivity by medical students is believed to reduce future attrition in the clinical-academic workforce. Thus, this study investigated the association between student demographics and research productivity amongst UK medical students. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This is a national multicentre cross-sectional study of UK medical students in the 2020/21 academic year. We appointed one student representative per medical school, and they disseminated a 42-item online questionnaire over nine weeks, through departmental emails and social media advertisements. The outcome measures were: (i) publications (yes/no) (ii) number of publications (iii) number of first-authored publications (iv) abstract presentation (yes/no). We utilised multiple logistic and zero-inflated Poisson regression analyses to test for associations between the outcome measures and predictor variables at a 5% significance level. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There are 41 medical schools in the UK. We received 1573 responses from 36 UK medical schools. We failed to recruit student representatives from three newly formed medical schools, whilst two medical schools prohibited us from sending the survey to their students. Women had lower odds of having a publication (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33-0.85) and on average had fewer first-author publications than men (IRR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37-0.89). Compared to white students, mixed-ethnicity students had greater odds of having a publication (OR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.67-5.59), an abstract presentation (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.37-3.26), and on average had a greater number of publications (IRR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.02-3.43). On average, students who attended independent UK secondary schools had a higher rate of first-author publications compared to those that attended state secondary schools (IRR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.23-3.15). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggest that there are gender, ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in research productivity among UK medical students.

Relationship Between Gender and Academic and Military Achievement Among USU Medical School Graduates,McBee E.; ; Dong T.; Ramani D.; Durning S.J.; Konopasky A.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite increases in the number of female matriculants in medical school, civilian data demonstrate that women still struggle to reach parity in attainment of leadership positions. In military medicine, we have seen a major increase in the number of women graduating from the USU. Yet, we still know little about the representation of female military physicians in leadership positions. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between gender and academic and military achievement among USU School of Medicine graduates. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Utilizing the USU alumni survey sent to graduates from the classes of 1980 to 2017, items of interest, such as highest military rank, leadership positions held, academic rank, and time in service, were used to evaluate the relationship between gender and academic and military achievement. Contingency table statistical analysis was conducted to compare the gender distribution on the survey items of interest. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Pairwise comparison demonstrated significant differences between gender in the O-4 (P = .003) and O-6 (P = .0002) groups, with females having a higher-than-expected number of O-4 officers and males having a higher-than-expected number of O-6 officers. These differences persisted in a subsample analysis that excluded those who separated from active duty prior to 20 years of service. There was a significant association between gender and holding the position of commanding officer (chi2(1) = 6.61, P < .05) with fewer females than expected. In addition, there was a significant association between gender and the highest academic rank achieved (chi2(3) = 9.48, P < 0.05) with lower-than-expected number of females reaching the level of full professor, in contrast to males who exceed the expected number. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study suggests that female graduates of USU School of Medicine have not achieved promotion to the highest levels of rank, military, or academic leadership at the projected rate. Efforts to explore what barriers may impact military medicine's desire to have more equal representation of women in higher ranks and positions should be undertaken with specific attention to what drives retention versus separation of medical officers and if systematic changes are needed to help promote equity for women in military medicine.<ovid:br/>Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

Misconceptions about women in leadership in academic medicine,Hastie M.J.; ; Lee A.; Siddiqui S.; Oakes D.; Wong C.A.,"Despite progress made over the past decade, women are under-represented in positions of leadership in academic medicine. Women physicians face numerous challenges throughout their careers. Despite achieving leadership positions, women in leadership continue to experience the impact of those challenges. In this review, we describe four misconceptions about women in leadership, along with their impact and recommendations. First, we describe differences between mentorship and sponsorship, as well as their impact on attaining leadership positions. Second, the gender pay gap persists throughout women's careers, regardless of leadership positions. Third, we explore the role of self-efficacy in leadership in the context of stereotype threats. Fourth, gendered expectations of leadership characteristics place an undue burden on women, detracting from their leadership effectiveness. Organizations can address the challenges women face by creating robust mentorship and sponsorship networks, establishing transparent and equitable pay policies, promoting and normalizing a broader range of leadership styles, and improving work flexibility and support structure.

Are We There Yet? No. Gender Disparities Still Exist and Affect Surgeon Burnout,Lake Z.; ; Dunford G.; Hunter J.; Berry S.,"Purpose of Review: Women represent almost half of all practicing surgeons in the USA; however, women continue to struggle with achieving equity in compensation, recruitment, promotion, and work-life balance. A review of recent literature about gender disparities in medicine, with focus on trauma surgery, was performed to better understand the issues and seek solutions. Recent Findings: Burnout affects patient care and physician well-being which results in increased health care costs, physician turnover as well as increased reports of PTSD and suicidal ideation among physicians. Job satisfaction and control over schedule are identified as significant contributors to burnout whereas workplace structures engrained with gender discrimination are major barriers to promotion. <ovid:br/>Summary: This review highlights that female physicians, particularly surgeons, are disproportionally affected by burnout when compared to their male colleagues.

A Survey of Parental Leave Academic Faculty Experiences Identifies an Overlooked Need,Nguyen T.; ; Williams B.; Sharrief A.,"Objective: This study sought to understand academic neurology faculty experiences undertaking parental leave (PL). <ovid:br/>Background(s): PL and disproportionate childcare may play a role in the gender disparity in senior leadership in academic neurology. There are a dearth of publications analyzing the experiences of PL in academic medicine. Design/Methods: An online, anonymous 34 question survey was developed to evaluate neurology faculty experiences with PL. Questions pertained to demographics, faculty rank, support for PL, coverage, lactation resources, and post-PL depression/anxiety. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 40 of 81 (49%) neurology faculty completed the survey. 60% of respondents were age 35- 44 years. 49.5% identified as assistant professor or instructor level. 61% had taken PL. 60% had provided coverage for a colleague on PL, with 60% rating the coverage as fair. For support, colleagues were considered the primary resource to assist in preparation of PL, followed by FMLA/department coordinators and then supervisors. 47.83% of respondents took 8-12 weeks. 30% of respondents took less than 4 weeks. Primary reasons to return from PL included obligation to patients, financial constraints, call responsibility and ran out of paid time leave. Peer pressure and employer pressure were cited by only 10% of respondents. 40% felt that PL would hinder advancement in the department. Although depression baby blues and anxiety were self-identified symptoms post-PL, very few faculty sought professional help. Overall, support for PL during and planning leave were rated highly for department and colleagues. However, support for lactation accommodations was identified as an opportunity for improvement. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Faculty respondents in our survey rated support planning and during PL favorably.

EP04.06-01 Compliance with Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines Among At-Risk Patients at a Rural Teaching Hospital in West Texas,Bharathidasan K.; ; Tran V.; Saowapa S.; Dayama N.; Rehman S.; Stroever S.,"Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Though lung cancer screening has evolved significantly over the past several decades, it continues to be severely underutilized. Black males have the highest age-adjusted incidence rate of lung and bronchus cancers and the highest mortality rates for the same when compared to white males and individuals of other races. Screening and treatment are critical for those at risk to reduce the burden of disease and death. Thus, it is important to identify gaps or disparities in these activities among our specific patient population. Our primary aim was to determine the proportion of patients in our health system that were lost to follow-up following initial computed tomography (CT) scan. Our secondary aim was to determine if there was a difference in this distribution across gender, race, and ethnicity groups. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in the University Medical Center health system, located in rural west Texas, from 2018 to 2022. We included patients 50 to 80 years old who met USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines and underwent initial evaluation with a low-dose CT scan. Our primary outcome was subsequent lung cancer screening within the timeframe recommended given the initial lung-RADS score (e.g., patients with score of 1 should follow-up in 12 months, those with score of 3 in 6 months, etc.). We calculated descriptive statistics and tested our hypotheses via Chi-square test with alpha = 0.05 defined a priori as threshold for statistical significance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We included 561 patients in our sample, the majority of whom were male (54.9%), white (86.5%), and non-Hispanic (72.6%). At initial screening, 82.0% had a lung-RADS score of 2 or lower and approximately 6.0% had lung-RADS score of 4A, 4B, or 4X. More than half of the initial sample were lost to follow-up according to screening guidelines (56.2%) with only 33.8% of patients who were initially screened with lung-RADS of 3 getting a second scan in 6 months. There was not a statistically significant difference in the distribution of follow-up across race groups (p = 0.27) or ethnicity (p = 0.17). However, there was a difference identified in follow-up by gender (p = 0.04) with significantly higher percent of males lost to follow up compared to females (58.7% vs. 41.3%, respectively). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Overall, we recognize our retention of patients in the screening pipeline needs improvement, though we do not detect a serious disparity in follow-up among our racial and ethnic minorities. Future work should focus on the best method to encourage all patients to follow screening guidelines, especially males in our practice. There is a need to identify barriers to follow-up as well as increase patient education and outreach to improve lung cancer screening adherence.

"Intersectional Disparities in Emergency Medicine Residents' Performance Assessments by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex",Lett E.; ; Tran N.K.; Nweke N.; Nguyen M.; Kim J.G.; Holmboe E.; McDade W.; Boatright D.,"Importance: Previous studies have demonstrated sex-specific disparities in performance assessments among emergency medicine (EM) residents. However, less work has focused on intersectional disparities by ethnoracial identity and sex in resident performance assessments. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To estimate intersectional sex-specific ethnoracial disparities in standardized EM resident assessments. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective cohort study used data from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestones (Milestones) assessments to evaluate ratings for EM residents at 128 EM training programs in the US. Statistical analyses were conducted in June 2020 to January 2023. Exposure: Training and assessment environments in EM residency programs across comparison groups defined by ethnoracial identity (Asian, White, or groups underrepresented in medicine [URM], ie, African American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic/Latine, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander) and sex (female/male). <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean Milestone scores (scale, 0-9) across 6 core competency domains: interpersonal and communications skills, medical knowledge, patient care, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and system-based practice. Overall assessment scores were calculated as the mean of the 6 competency scores. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The study sample comprised 128 ACGME-accredited programs and 16634 assessments for 2708 EM residents of which 1913 (70.6%) were in 3-year and 795 (29.4%) in 4-year programs. Most of the residents were White (n = 2012; 74.3%), followed by Asian (n = 477; 17.6%), Hispanic or Latine (n = 213; 7.9%), African American or Black (n = 160; 5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (n = 24; 0.9%), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (n = 4; 0.1%). Approximately 14.3% (n = 386) and 34.6% (n = 936) were of URM groups and female, respectively. Compared with White male residents, URM female residents in 3-year programs were rated increasingly lower in the medical knowledge (URM female score, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.17), patient care (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01), and practice-based learning and improvement (-0.37; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.09) domains by postgraduate year 3 year-end assessment; URM female residents in 4-year programs were also rated lower in all 6 competencies over the assessment period. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: This retrospective cohort study found that URM female residents were consistently rated lower than White male residents on Milestone assessments, findings that may reflect intersectional discrimination in physician competency evaluation. Eliminating sex-specific ethnoracial disparities in resident assessments may contribute to equitable health care by removing barriers to retention and promotion of underrepresented and minoritized trainees and facilitating diversity and representation among the emergency physician workforce..<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 American Medical Association.

LEADING WITH PURPOSE: A LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN TRAINEES IN MEDICINE,Krishnan G.; ; Baggstrom M.Q.; Spencer A.; Mattar C.; Bhayani R.,"SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Despite near parity of women and men entering medical school, there is still marked gender inequity in academic medicine as reflected in leadership positions, promotion, assessments, and job opportunities. Awareness and engagement, mentoring and networking, and leadership development are valuable interventional strategies to advance women in medicine until systemic barriers have been addressed. Structured leadership development programs create safe space for learning, networking, enhanced leadership competencies and workplace retention. A group of 5 women leaders from different stages of academic medicine at Washington University (WUSM) developed a skill-based longitudinal leadership development program for women trainees in the Department of Medicine (DOM) for AY 2022- 2023. Through an application and selection process, 6 subspecialty fellows and 6 internal medicine residents within the DOM were selected to participate in this 8-month long certificate program that commenced Fall 2022 and concludes Spring 2023. DESCRIPTION: In-person sessions were held every 6 weeks and included topics such as finding meaning and purpose in medicine, communicating effectively, building your academic team for success, leadership and communication skills, creating your career development plan, negotiation, and conflict management. An active learning environment was created through small and large group discussions, self-reflection activities, and negotiation scenarios in the simulation center. Each participant was paired with a woman faculty mentor for the duration of the program to support goal-directed advancement. EVALUATION: In the pre-course survey only 42% (5/12) had primary mentors and 25% (3/12) had an individual career development plan. Using the Kirkpatrick framework for Levels of Program Evaluation, satisfaction with the program was assessed through post session surveys on the effectiveness of the speaker, satisfaction with the content delivery and pre/post assessment surveys to check knowledge acquisition and skills. At the end of the program, self-reflective survey questions combined with an observed role play will be implemented to demonstrate skill acquisition. We plan to disseminate impact surveys after program completion at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years to evaluate retention and implementation of new skills acquired. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Leadership Development courses provide vital skills to support the future women leaders in medicine reach their full potential. Role plays and simulation tests help practice and develop negotiation and communication skills. To create a sustainable program, we have obtained buy-in from key stakeholders such as the Department chair, Vice Chairs, and Program Directors. We have secured funding to provide meals during the evening sessions, administrative support to handle program logistics, and recorded sessions to accommodate varying trainee schedules.",2023,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,38,Supplement 2,S717,641879996,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z,,#817,Krishnan 2023,"",""
"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Needs Assessment for a C-L Psychiatry Service",Crum I.T.; ; Spada M.; Moschenross D.; Faeder M.; Shenai N.; Clark T.; Sterenson E.; Gopalan P.,"Background: While a lens focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) brings immense value to medicine, the importance of DEI efforts has only recently received increasing focus. A strong focus on diversity improves patient outcomes. Recruitment and retention, departmental culture, and utilizing best practices to mitigate implicit bias are key strategies to improve diversity (Rosenkranz et al, 2021). It is with this lens that our CL psychiatry service created a DEI task force in 2021. To best characterize the DEI needs of our service, we developed, disseminated, and analyzed a needs assessment on DEI-related issues relevant to our service. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We disseminated an anonymous, electronic survey to members of the CL psychiatry service, including physicians, nurse clinicians, and administrators assessing attitudes, comfort, and knowledge on the topic. The survey additionally sought feedback on our DEI mission statement and our implementation of a competency-based behavioral interviewing model for fellowship applicants. We analyzed the preliminary data. The University of Pittsburgh Quality Improvement Review Board approved this project. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Preliminary results with 17 participants demonstrated targetable gaps in comfort and knowledge. Only 23.5% of respondents indicated that they were comfortable or very comfortable with refugee and immigrant health disparities. Other target areas with low overall comfort include inequities related to Latinx/Hispanic communities (29.4%), gender-based inequities (41.2%), and intellectual and developmental differences (41.2%). Regarding knowledge gaps, 82.4% correctly identified that Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic individuals experience postpartum depression 2-3 times the rate of the general population, 76.5% correctly identified that Black/African American patients are offered medications for opioid use disorder at lower rates than white patients. The survey revealed that while 64.7% our respondents were able to identify characteristics of person-centered language, only 17.6% were able to robustly define the term. Respondents identified gaps in our mission statement for the CL service concerning inclusivity; specifically, while the mission statement had a strong anti-racism stance it lacked language concerning inclusivity around other minoritorized communities including, those identifying as LGBTQ+, those with disabilities, and those from minoritized religious groups. Of the four respondents that did participate in the competency-based behavioral interviewing model, half felt that the process was highly effective in reducing bias in interviewing, while half felt it was neither effective nor ineffective. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We will use survey results to guide future interventions on our CL service, including creating a more inclusive mission statement and targeting education to areas of discomfort and knowledge gaps. We believe that the creation of our DEI Task Force will be the beginning of a more inclusive workspace for our nurses, physicians, and patients alike, with the goal of providing culturally competent care to all patients, especially those who have been victimized, marginalized, and oppressed by the healthcare system.

Data collected for analysis included the gender of program directors, fellowship faculty, orthopaedic surgery department faculty, current sports medicine fellows and fellows who graduated within the last five years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the academic year 2021-2022, 132 sports medicine fellows were in fellowship training in the United States within 97 programs. Of these, 113 (85.6%) were men and 19 (14.4%) were women (p<0.001). Within the past five years, 419 fellows were listed as completing a sports medicine fellowship, with 375 (89.5%) being men, and 44 (10.5%) being women (p<0.001). There is no significant difference in the gender composition of current fellows compared to the composition of fellows within the last 5 years (p=0.74).

Sexual Dimorphic Metabolism of Soy Isoflavone Daidzein: Potential Implication in Precision Nutrition,Cross T.-W.; ; Simpson A.; Leonard L.; Choi M.S.; Maher G.,"Objectives: Equol is a gut microbial metabolite derived from soy isoflavone daidzein that has high estrogenic potency and antioxidant properties. Less than half of the human population can produce equol, while equol-producing capacity is thought to be a critical determinant in obtaining the health benefits of soy. Interestingly, it has been reported that women are more likely to become equol-producers after chronic soy consumption compared to men. Women are also thought to produce a higher concentration of equol than men. However, the sex differences of equol production are not consistently observed among clinical trials, likely due to inherent confounding variables in humans such as gut microbiome and host genetics. Therefore, we sought to assess sexual dimorphism in equol production using a controlled model system by colonizing germ-free mice with human microbiomes. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that females are more likely to harbor equol-producing bacteria and exert greater equol-producing capacity than males. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Six- to nine-week-old male and female germ-free mice were colonized through fecal microbial transplantation with feces collected from one of the ten human donors. Mice were fed a semi-purified diet containing 1.5% (wt/wt) daidzein. Two weeks after colonization, serum was collected to determine equol-producing capacity. Cecal microbiota was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among the ten human microbial communities, two of them consistently induced equol-producing phenotypes in recipient mice of both sexes. Interestingly, one fecal sample exerts equol-producing phenotypes in female recipients but not males. Within each equol-producing microbial community, female recipient mice had significantly greater serum equol concentration and lower daidzein compared to males. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrated a sexual dimorphic phenomenon that female mice are more likely to retain equol-producing bacteria and produce a greater level of equol than males when inoculated with the same donor feces. Further understanding of factors that contribute to these sex-specific differences may inform precision nutrition when developing next-generation probiotics to maximize health benefits from soy consumption.

Among respondents, 1036 individuals [98.1%] resided in the US. Overall, 910 respondents (86.2%) were married or partnered and 690 respondents (65.3%) had children. While 824 physicians (78.0%) correctly identified the age of precipitous fertility decline, 798 individuals (75.6%) reported delaying family building and 389 individuals (36.8%) had experienced infertility. Concerning measures taken to accommodate childbearing or parenthood, 199 women (28.8%) said they had taken extended leave, 171 women (24.8%) said they had chosen a different specialty, 325 women (47.1%) said they had reduced their work hours, 171women (24.8%) said they had changed their practice setting, and 326 women (47.2%) said they had passed up opportunities for career advancement among those with children. Additionally, 30 women with children (4.3%) had left medicine entirely. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, women physicians reported that career-related pressures influenced the timing of childbearing and led to marked alterations to career trajectories to accommodate family building and parenthood.

Emergency Medicine Workforce Attrition Differences by Age and Gender,Gettel C.; ; Courtney D.M.; Agrawal P.; Madsen T.E.; Venkatesh A.K.,"Background and Objectives: Analyses to date have not assessed the age at which male and female emergency medicine (EM) physicians exhibit attrition from the workforce. We sought to identify trends in: (1) the median age at the year of attrition, and (2) variables associated with EM workforce attrition. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a repeated cross-sectional analysis of EM physicians receiving reimbursement for at least 50 Evaluation & Management (E/M) services [99281-99285] from Medicare Part B linked to demographic data from the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM). Stratified by gender, we calculated the median age at the year of attrition for EM physicians including both temporary and permanent attrition, respectively defined as physicians not meeting the reimbursement threshold for E/M services in the immediate subsequent year or all subsequent study years. Finally, we estimated logistic regression models to quantify the association of age and gender with attrition from the workforce. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 2013 to 2020, 38,909 unique EM physicians met study inclusion criteria, including 27,208 males and 11,701 females. Across all years, 5914 male EM physicians permanently left the workforce and had a median (IQR) age at attrition of 56.4 (44.5-65.4) while 2464 female EM physicians permanently left the workforce and had a median age at attrition of 44.0 (38.0-53.8). In 2013, the median (IQR) age at permanent attrition for male EM physicians was 59.2 (46.9-64.8), which decreased to 55.3 (44.3-65.8) in 2018.

A Dietary Pattern Derived To Correlate With Estrogens and Risk of Endometrial Cancer in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study,Crous-Bou M.; ; Lujan-Barroso L.; Madrero A.; Castro-Espin C.; Dossus L.; Kaaks R.; Agudo A.; Marta C.-B.,"Objectives: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the female malignancy most highly related to excess body weight, and is considered a model of hormonal carcinogenesis. Diet may play a role in altering estrogen metabolism and subsequently EC risk. Our objectives are to identify a dietary pattern related to circulating estrogens and to assess its association with EC risk. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study has been conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. After 15 years of follow-up, 2023 incident EC cases have been reported out of 285440 women included. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) are available at baseline. Circulating plasma concentrations of estrone and estradiol are available for a subset (N=1621; EC cases N=103). Reduced rank regression (RRR) has been used to identify food groups that correlate with biomarkers to create an estrogenic dietary pattern (EDP). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox regression have been calculated to estimate the prospective association between pre-diagnostic EDP and EC risk. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The RRR pattern was negatively correlated with estradiol (r=-0.55) and estrone (r=-0.57) and explained 6.32% of variation in sex hormone levels. Stepwise linear regression retained a simplified pattern (EDP) characterized by high intake of legumes, high-fat dairy, poultry, fish, wine and beer and low intake of cereals, sugars and vegetable oils. Preliminary multivariable analysis showed a weak association between the EDP and EC risk (HR=1.12; 95%CI=1.00-1.25). The association is stronger in postmenopausal women and in women with overweight and obesity. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This is the first study that derived a dietary pattern specifically correlated with estrogen levels in European population and to evaluate its association with EC. Our results support the promotion of specific habits and could impact dietary recommendations to reduce EC incidence.

Gender Disparities in Emergency Medicine Over the Last Decade,Ramirez M.; ; Jobeun N.; Chung A.S.,"Background and Objectives: The gender gap in medicine has decreased over time, however, gender disparities are still present. Women are less likely to hold positions of power, receive grant funding, and are paid less than their male counterparts. A lack of representation in medicine has been shown to lead to higher rates of leaving medicine, retiring early, and more frequent microaggressions. With these factors in mind, residency programs have made efforts to increase the attrition of female applicants into emergency medicine (EM). In this study we will examine the trends in female applicants into emergency medicine and to all specialties over the past decade. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a retrospective data review conducted in July 2022 using applicant data from The Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and resident data from The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for the 2011-2012 to 2020-2021 academic years. Using the ERAS database, the number of female applicants for EM residencies was compared to the total number of female applicants in all specialties. Using the ACGME database, the number of active female residents in emergency medicine was compared to the active female residents in all specialties. A logistic and poison regression model were used to analyze the results. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There is a mild increase in the gender diversity of the applicant pool. For every year, there is a 1% increase in the odds of an applicant being female (Odds ratio = 1.01 compared to EM applicants that had an increase of 1.5% with an odds ratio of 1.015). There was no significant change in the number of active female residents in EM residencies across the years. There was also no major difference noted between the ACGME data and ERAS data for EM. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The data show that the average percentage of EM female applicants and EM female residents in the last 10 years is similar. It must now be considered that the issue at hand is not gender discrimination or a biased selection process, but rather that not enough women are applying to EM residency programs.

"Education, Training & Research Track: Women in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: The UNC Experience",Keefe S.; ; Bhatt P.; Baldwin C.; Turvey T.; Fisher E.,"Oral Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) has traditionally been dominated by men, with only 10% of women<ovid:sup>1</ovid:sup>. This imbalance is a result of the lower application and higher attrition rates for women in surgical fields, due to factors such as a lack of role models, bias against women, and pressures related to personal or family reasons<ovid:sup>2, 3, 4,5</ovid:sup>. There has been little comprehensive historical data comparing men and women in OMFS programs. Despite historically lower representation of women in OMFS programs, our hypothesis is that there is no difference in graduation rate, or percentage of residents who graduate with medical degrees, the pursuit of post-residency fellowships, board certification, or accept academic positions between genders in OMFS residents at the University of North Carolina (UNC). A comprehensive list of enrollees and graduates was prepared for the UNC OMFS residency program since its inception in 1972. Graduation rate, post-graduate training, medical degree, post-graduate employment, and board certification were compared between genders. There has been a total of 147 enrollees and 115 graduates at the UNC OMFS residency programs since 1972. 20% (29/147) of all UNC OMFS residency enrollees are women. The enrollment of women has increased each decade, and the program currently has 50% (8/16) women. Women had a higher attrition rate compared to men, 18% vs. 8% (p=.15). 27% of women pursued fellowship training compared to 18% of men (p= 0.48). 47% of women accepted academic positions versus 36% of men (p=0.41). Of enrollees who completed the program, 100% of women obtained board certification compared to 96% of men. (p=.83) More women obtained medical degrees than men, 61% and 40%, respectively (p<0.05). This study examines the representation of women in the UNC OMFS residency program. We found that historically, women have represented a small percentage of residency trainees, with the first woman entering the program in 1979 and the first dual-degree women graduating in 1997 after the start of the dual-degree program in 1973. However, the enrollment of women has increased each decade and the program currently has 50% women, which is consistent with gender representation in dental schools<ovid:sup>6</ovid:sup>. The study also found that the attrition rate was higher than that of men largely due to a high women's attrition rate prior to the year 2000 when overall enrollment for women was significantly lower. No association was found during the time frame of 2000 through 2022 between attrition rates and gender. It appears that women are more likely to obtain medical degrees, but this is due to the concurrent influx of women and the recent transition to a dual-degree-only program. Following completion of the program, women are just as likely to become board certified, enter fellowship, and join academic practices as men. The study suggests that a broader analysis including multiple programs across the country should be conducted to determine whether these patterns observed at UNC are consistent on a national level. 1.

Trends in the perception of race and gender within ophthalmology research,Ganapath S.K.; ; Dossantos J.; Cui D.; Choudhry H.; Kaleem M.,"Purpose : In recent years, there has been a push in medicine to decrease race and gender disparities. In our study, we analyze bibliometric trends on the perception of gender and race in the field of ophthalmology. Methods : The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried between January 2000 and June 2022. Custom terms including woman, 'ophthalmology, and race were inputted in the advanced search of each database to screen relevant publications. Article publication year, authors, journal, citations, institution, and country were collected. Areas of focus were classified as history/biographies, career analysis, pay gap, recruitment/retention, scholarly productivity, training, and disparities. Data extracted was averaged for gender articles, race articles, and both. The citations per year, total citations, and article age were compared using Pearson's correlation and Spearman's test. Results : Ninety eight articles were analyzed including 67 articles on gender and 31 articles on race. Research on gender and race in ophthalmology has increased from 2000-2022 (Figure 1).Citations per year were associated with total citations (r=0.814; p<0.001) and the age of both race and gender articles (r=0.225, p=0.03. Additionally, the age of the articles on race correlated with citations (r=0.367, p=0.04). Amongst journals, JAMA Ophthalmology had the most publications with fifteen articles and 143 citations. The United States published 56 articles with 749 citations, the highest of any country. Additionally, the University of Toronto was the most productive institution with five articles on race and gender and 58 citations. Amongst articles ongender, sixteen articles with 412 citations pertained to scholarly productivity, the most published topic. However, disparities were the most popular focus for race with ten articles and 196 citations. Conclusions : These trends in publication may reflect the increased awareness for in recent years. Nevertheless, further work needs to be performed to evaluate factors that can overcome barriers in race and gender within ophthalmology.",2023,/,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,64,8,5372,641996591,,,#829,Ganapath 2023,"",""
WOMEN FACULTY AND FULL-TIME CLINICAL FACULTY MENTORSHIP NEEDS NOT MET WITH TRADITIONAL MENTORSHIP STRU CTU RES,Deshpande N.; ; Starks H.; Cornia P.B.; Sokol-Hessner L.; Chander G.; Mookherjee S.,"BACKGROUND: Mentorship is vital for academic medicine faculty career advancement, productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, yet specific mentoring needs and preferences are not well understood, particularly for full-time clinical faculty (FTC). There is a gender gap in advancement and promotion in academic medicine and mentorship is also vulnerable to bias. We surveyed our Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) faculty to determine gender and promotion pathway differences in 1) having mentors; 2) satisfaction with mentorship; 3) preferences for finding mentors; and 4) barriers to providing and receiving mentorship. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): DGIM includes 307 inpatient, outpatient and research faculty across multiple sites. We created a 24-item survey to assess the 4 domains above and examined the distribution of responses by gender and promotion track using chi-square tests. Faculty were invited to respond in October 2022. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 192 (63%) faculty completed the survey. 40 were not queried on satisfaction with mentors: 29 had <4 months in DGIM and we presumed their mentors were at prior institutions; 11 were unsure whether they had a mentor. Frequency: 107/192 (56%) faculty reported having at least 1 mentor; the proportion of faculty with mentors was similar for women (n=108, 54%) and men (n=79, 59%, p=0.667). There were significant differences by track among who had mentors (40/90, 44% FTC vs 46/58, 79% Clinician-Scholar, and 18/23, 78% Physician- Scientist, p<0.001). Satisfaction with current mentorship: 65% of faculty with mentors were satisfied. Similar proportions of women (67%) and men (64%) reported satisfaction with mentorship (p=0.895). Among faculty with mentors who were dissatisfied, 18% were CS, compared to 11% FTC and 6% PS (p=0.028). 28/52 (54%) faculty without mentors were dissatisfied with their lack of mentorship; most were FTC (n=17, 65%) or CS (n=9, 35%, p=0.002); all 4 PS with no mentor were satisfied. Preferences: More women preferred assistance (facilitated connection or mentor assignment) with finding a mentor to support promotion (52% vs 44% for men, p=0.044) and career development (80% vs 62%, p=0.009). More FTC, compared to CS or PS, preferred assistance with finding mentors for promotion (80% vs 66% vs 50%, p=0.001) and career development (77% vs 59% vs 42%, p=0.001). Barriers: Lack of time was the most prevalent barrier for both receiving (56%) and providing (58%) mentorship. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While many faculty reported satisfaction with current mentorship, we identified opportunities for improvement. Many faculty without mentors were dissatisfied by the lack of mentorship and FTC tended to lack mentorship. Women preferred facilitated connections with potential mentors.

Impact of parenthood on career progression in STEMM,Torres I.L.; ; Sugrue V.; Rahal M.; Samson A.; Arnaud E.,"Background Despite decades of efforts to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM), women are still vastly underrepresented in this sector, particularly in leadership positions - including in fields where women outnumber men as graduates [1]. Thus, attracting more women into STEMM careers is insufficient to close the gender gap and more research efforts should be invested into developing effective interventions to increase retention. Evidence shows that implicit gender bias partially explains the so-called STEMM ""leaky pipeline' [2]. However, another contributing factor has received less attention: parenthood. The negative impact of work-family conflict on the career and wellbeing of mothers is well reported, but few studies have addressed this question in STEMM. A recent US study shows that parenthood is an important driver of gender imbalance in STEM, with 42% of mothers leaving full-time STEM employment after becoming parents [4]. However, the mechanisms of mothers attrition remain poorly understood. Research analysing the average publication rates of American and Canadian scholars suggests that parenthood explains the widely reported gender productivity gap in academia [5], yet it remains unclear why parenthood impacts on scientific productivity and why only mothers seem to be affected. Methods We conducted a global survey to measure the impact of parenthood on career progression in STEMM. Statistical descriptive and regression analyses were performed to identify the mechanisms promoting the exit of mothers from STEMM careers. Results About 9,000 STEMM professionals from 128 countries completed the survey. Based on self-reported average publication rate, our data show there is a significant scientific productivity gap between mothers and fathers in every academic field analysed. By using a Poisson mixed-effects model, we found that women working in Physical Sciences experience a significant reduction in scientific productivity after becoming parents. Moreover, our data shows there is widespread maternity discrimination in STEMM. Mothers were more likely than fathers to say they were perceived as being less competent, and were offered fewer professional opportunities, since becoming a parent. Importantly, using a general linear model we found a significant interaction between fewer offered opportunities and lower publication rates for mothers. Taken together, our data suggest that maternity discrimination is an important obstacle to the career advancement of women in STEMM by indirectly impacting on scientific productivity. Conclusions Our research shows that structural barriers related to parenthood contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the STEMM sector, and thus has important implications for the design of policies and interventions to retain women in STEMM careers.",2023,/,BMC Proceedings,17,Supplement 15,,643048902,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12919-023-00275-w,,#832,Torres 2023,"",""
Gender differences in medical errors among older patients and inequalities in medical compensation compared with younger adults,Liu P.; ; Yang Y.; Cheng J.,"Background: Despite growing evidence focusing on health inequalities in older adults, inequalities in medical compensation compared with younger adults and gender disparities of medical errors among older patients have received little attention. This study aimed to disclose the aforementioned inequalities and examine the disparities in medical errors among older patients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): First, available litigation documents were searched on ""China Judgment Online"" using keywords including medical errors. Second, we compiled a database with 5,072 disputes. After using systematic random sampling to retain half of the data, we removed 549 unrelated cases. According to the age, we identified 424 and 1,563 cases related to older and younger patients, respectively. Then, we hired two frontline physicians to review the documents and independently judge the medical errors and specialties involved. A third physician further considered the divergent results. Finally, we compared the medical compensation between older and younger groups and medical errors and specialties among older patients. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Older patients experienced different medical errors in divergent specialties. The medical error rate of male older patients was over 4% higher than that of females in the departments of general surgery and emergency. Female older patients were prone to adverse events in respiratory medicine departments and primary care institutes. The incidence of insufficient implementation of consent obligation among male older patients was 5.18% higher than that of females. However, females were more likely to suffer adverse events at the stages of diagnosis, therapy, and surgical operation. The total amount of medical compensation obtained by younger patients was 41.47% higher than that of older patients. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Except for the common medical errors and departments involved, additional attention should be paid to older patients of different genders according to the incidence of medical errors. Setting up the department of geriatrics or specialist hospitals is also an important alternative to improve patient safety for older people. Furthermore, there may be inequality in medical compensation in older patients due to the tort liability law of China.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Liu, Yang and Cheng.",2022,/,Frontiers in public health,10,"(Liu) School of Public Administration, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China(Yang) School of Government, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China(Cheng) School of Public Administration and Emergency Management, Jinan University,",883822,639225638,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.883822,36211673,#833,Liu 2022,"",""
Analysis of risk factors of hyperpyrexia suffered by post neurosurgical patients after removal of drainage tube,Bo S.; ; Zheng J.; Xi J.; Zhao Z.; Yao G.; Zheng B.,"Objective To analyze the risk factors of hyperthermia after removal of drainage tubes in patients after neurosurgery. Methods The clinical data of 146 patients after neurosurgery with indwelling drainage tubes admitted to the department of critical care medicine of Pecking University Third Hospital from January 2019 to July 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into hyperthermia group (body temperature >= 39 ) and non-hyperthermia group (body temperature < 39 ) according to whether their body temperatures within 24 hours after removal of drainage tubes. General clinical data and outcomes of the two groups were collected, and different tendentious scores were matched with the hyperthermia group and non-hyperthermia group based on Glasgow coma score (GCS), respectively. After such matching, the clinical baseline characteristics [age, gender, admission diagnosis, major complications, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) at admission, GCS], number of days of drainage tubes retention, location of drainage tubes, microbial culture results before removal of drainage tubes, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil ratio (NEU%) before and after removal of drainage tubes as well as clinical outcomes of the cohort patients were analyzed. The primarily outcome was in-hospital mortality, and then the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Results A total of 146 patients after neurosurgery were included, 28 of which developed hyperthermia after removal of drainage tubes. The GCS scores at admission in the hyperthermia group were significantly lower than that in the non-hyperthermia group, while the proportion of hypertension and diabetes in the hyperthermia group was significantly higher than that in the non-hyperthermia group. Based on GCS scores, the two groups, each of which included 28 patients, were matched with tendentious scores, and there was no significant difference in gender, age, GCS scores and the proportion of hypertension and diabetes between the two groups. The main disease for patients upon admission was cerebral hemorrhage (53.6%, 30/56). The proportion of indwelling ventricular drainage tube retention in the hyperthermia group was significantly higher than that in the non-hyperthermia group [32.1% (9/28) vs. 7.1% (2/28), P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference in the location of other drainage tubes between the two groups. The proportion of lumbar puncture in the hyperthermia group was also significantly higher than that in the non-hyperthermia group [25.0% (7/28) vs. 0 (0/28), P < 0.05]. Compared with the non-hyperthermia group, WBC [x10<ovid:sup>9</ovid:sup>/L: 13.0 (9.5, 15.2) vs. 11.5 (8.8, 13.3)] of 1 day before removal of drainage tubes, NEU% [0.892 (0.826, 0.922) vs. 0.843 (0.809, 0.909)] after removal of drainage tubes and positive rate of drainage-fluid culture or drainage-tube-tip culture [7.1% (2/28) vs. 0% (0/28)] in the hyperthermia group increased, but there were not significant differences. There was no significant difference in the proportion of pulmonary, urinary system and blood flow infection before removal of drainage tubes in the two groups. In terms of primary outcomes, compared with the non-hyperthermia group, the length of ICU stay [days: 17.0 (8.0, 32.3) vs. 8.5 (1.0, 16.8), P < 0.05] in the hyperthermia group was significantly prolonged, and the in-hospital mortality [35.7% (10/28) vs. 10.7% (3/28), P < 0.05] in the hyperthermia group was obviously increased. The positive rate of carbapenem-resistant bacteria culture [32.1% (9/28) vs. 3.6% (1/28), P < 0.05] in the hyperthermia group during hospitalization was significantly higher than that in the non-hyperthermia group. Conclusions Hyperthermia after removal of drainage tubes for patients after neurosurgery can significantly prolong the length of ICU stay and increase the in-hospital mortality, which may be related to the secondary infection caused by indwelling intracranial drainage tubes and the intracranial spread of bacteria caused by removal of drainage tubes, as well as the intracranial multidrug-resistant bacterial infection caused by the drainage tubes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

Knowledge of Fertility and Perspectives about Family Planning among Female Physicians,Smith K.S.; ; Bakkensen J.B.; Hutchinson A.P.; Cheung E.O.; Thomas J.; Grote V.; Moreno P.I.; Goldman K.N.; Jordan N.; Feinberg E.C.,"Importance: Pervasive gender disparities exist in medicine regarding promotion, achievement of academic rank, and appointment to leadership positions. Fertility and childbearing concerns may contribute to these disparities. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess fertility knowledge and concerns and evaluate barriers to family building and impact on academic attrition reported by female physicians. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This qualitative study used mixed methods; first, structured 1:1 interviews exploring fertility knowledge and family-building concerns were conducted among 16 female physicians between November 2019 and May 2020. Transcripts were coded in Dedoose and used to develop a survey instrument with subsequent pilot testing conducted among 24 female physicians between April 2020 and September 2020. Data analysis was performed from January 2021 to March 2021. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Fertility knowledge, perceptions of peer and institutional support surrounding childbearing, factors contributing to delayed childbearing, and impact of family planning on career decisions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among 16 women who completed qualitative interviews, 4 (25%) were Asian, 1 (6%) was Black, 1 (6%) was multiracial, and 10 (63%) were White; mean (SD) age was 34.9 (4.0) years. Evaluation of fertility knowledge revealed 3 notable themes: (1) inadequate formal fertility education, (2) informal learning through infertility experiences of patients, peers, or personal struggles, and (3) desire to improve medical education through early introduction and transparent discussions about infertility. Exploration of childbearing concerns similarly revealed several salient themes: (1) high incidence of delayed childbearing, (2) perceived lack of peer and administrative support, and (3) impact of family building on career trajectory. These themes were borne out in pilot testing of the survey instrument: of 24 female physicians (7 Asian women [27%], 1 Black woman [4%], 1 Hispanic or Latinx woman [4%], 1 multiracial woman [4%], 15 White women [58%]; mean [SD] age, 36.1 [6.7] years), 17 (71%) had delayed childbearing and 16 (67%) had altered their career for family-building reasons. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: Qualitative interviews identified fertility and family building concerns among female physicians and were used to develop a tailored survey for women in medicine. These findings suggest that female physicians may delay childbearing and make substantial accommodations in their careers to support family building. A large-scale national survey is needed to better characterize the unique fertility, childbearing, and parenting needs of women in academic medicine to better understand how these concerns may contribute to academic attrition..<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Acoustical Society of America.

They excluded studies not specifically addressing women and those without gender-stratified outcomes. They extracted and analyzed the following data: study design, population, sample size, response rate, participant age, percentage of women, mentoring prevalence, and outcomes. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of 2,439 citations identified, 91 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 65 quantitative and 26 qualitative studies. Mentoring was associated with objective and subjective measures of career success. Women perceived mentorship to be more valuable to their career development yet were more likely to report having no mentor. Additionally, women were more likely to report lower levels of research productivity, less career satisfaction, and greater barriers to promotion. Qualitative results indicated that women had less access to informal mentoring and family responsibilities had a greater effect on their career outcomes. Professional networking, female mentors, and relational aspects of mentoring were common themes. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This review examined gender disparities in mentoring and the impact on research productivity, promotion success, and career satisfaction for women in academic medicine. Institution-supported mentoring programs are needed to facilitate identification of appropriate mentors and promotion of a more equitable academic career environment for women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2022,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,97,3,444EP  - 458,636905494,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004563,34907962,#836,Shen 2022,"",""
Gender inequities in medical research funding is driving an exodus of women from Australian STEMM academia,Borger J.G.; ; Purton L.E.,"Universally, women are under-represented in senior academic leadership in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM). Successful funding outcomes are a critical point in career progression, to continue both a scientist's research but also for their retention within the STEMM workforce. A common explanation for the lower success rate of women in securing funding is that fewer women apply for funding. However, this does not adequately explain the gender inequities in funding outcomes, both in terms of fewer funded applications and also of reduced funding awarded per grant, resulting in less overall success. Gendered funding outcomes occur within academic institutions and peak funding bodies due to historical, systemic conscious and unconscious biases during peer review. As a cumulative bias over a woman's research career, this results in women being under-represented in STEMM and the loss of their contributions to medical research, reducing innovation through a lack of diverse workforces.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

"Gender equity in emergency medicine: Five years on, where are we headed?",Govindasamy L.S.; ; Terziovski M.; Wheeler M.; Rixon A.; Wilson S.,"The challenge of addressing gender inequality was highlighted in the 2016 Trainee Focus of Emergency Medicine Australasia. Despite increasing numbers of female medical graduates, including increasing female trainees in emergency medicine (EM), this has not yet translated to equal representation in formal leadership roles. Five years later, as the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) welcomes the second female college president, this article explores the gendered leadership gap in EM from an organisational and intersectional feminist perspective and recommends high-level strategies for change. Notably, ACEM has demonstrated committed engagement with gender equity, such as the establishment of the Advancing Women in Emergency Section. It has also achieved gender parity in provisional trainees and improved women's representation on the ACEM Board. However, broader organisational processes that ensure work-life integration, transparent leadership development pathways and equitable recruitment, promotion, retention and evaluation remain critical.

Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, time series plots, and simple linear regression for the rate of change over time. Medical students and general surgery residency trainees of Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino of Spanish origin, White, and other races were included. Data for non-US citizens or nonpermanent residents were excluded.

Author-level data confirm the widening gender gap in publishing rates during COVID-19,Madsen E.B.; ; Nielsen M.W.; Bjornholm J.; Jagsi R.; Andersen J.P.,"Publications are essential for a successful academic career, and there is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified existing gender disparities in the publishing process. We used longitudinal publication data on 431,207 authors in four disciplines-basic medicine, biology, chemistry and clinical medicine-to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on the annual publishing rates of men and women. In a difference-in-differences analysis, we estimated that the average gender difference in publication productivity increased from -0.26 in 2019 to -0.35 in 2020; this corresponds to the output of women being 17% lower than the output of men in 2109, and 24% lower in 2020. An age-group comparison showed a widening gender gap for both early-career and mid-career scientists. The increasing gender gap was most pronounced among highly productive authors and in biology and clinical medicine.

"An analysis of gender disparities amongst United States medical students, general surgery residents, vascular surgery trainees, and the vascular surgery workforce",Arya S.; ; Franco-Mesa C.; Erben Y.,"Gender diversity in medicine continues to be a critical topic, and gender diversity within surgical fields remains an overarching challenge. In the following review, we objectively address the data available in terms of training slots for women in general and vascular surgery and within the vascular surgery workforce. Overall, women comprise 36% of active physicians in the 2019 Association of American Medical Colleges data. The number of women in surgical fields is lower representing 22% in general surgery, 9% in neurosurgery, 6% in orthopedic surgery, 17% in plastic surgery, 8% in thoracic surgery, and 15% in vascular surgery. Also notable is the lower academic ranks held by women in surgery. The proportion of women instructors in surgery in 2020 was 61%, assistant professors 30%, associate professors 23%, and full-time professors only 13.5%. There are multiple opportunities across the divisional/institutional/societal domains in which mentorship and sponsorship can promote gender equity and inclusion. Recruitment and retention of women and minorities into the vascular academic and private practices is essential to ensure best patient outcomes and quality of care for our patients. We hope that by shedding light on this topic, there will be greater awareness and improved strategies to address the disparities within institutions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery",2022,/,Journal of Vascular Surgery,75,1,5EP  - 9,2015594405,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2021.09.029,34619315,#841,Arya 2022,"",""
Using a Community-Based Participatory Approach to Address Gender Equity in Academic Medicine: The Center for Women in Medicine and Science at the University of Minnesota,Berge J.M.; ; Macheledt K.; Watson S.; Dorr H.; Pusalavidyasagar S.; Kunin-Batson A.; Pratt R.; Zimmer S.L.; Tolar J.; Termuhlen A.,"Many medical schools are instituting gender equity initiatives to address long-standing inequities (e.g., salary, leadership positions, resource distribution) between women and men in academic medicine. However, few theory-driven models exist with built-in metrics to assess the impact of gender equity initiatives. The authors describe the theory- and metric-driven process used to create the Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota (UMN) Medical School. An innovative theory-driven approach using community-based participatory research (CBPR) was used to create and organize CWIMS. CBPR acknowledges community members (e.g., faculty members, staff), academic organizational representatives (e.g., department heads, center directors), and administrative leaders (e.g., deans) as equal contributors in carrying out all aspects of gender equity work. CBPR values collaborative approaches that empower faculty, promote co-learning and co-creation of initiatives among all university partners, and build upon already existing community strengths and resources. Four CWIMS action groups were created using CBPR principles. The action groups are retention and recruitment; mentoring; salary, resource, and leadership equity; and strategic communications and collaborations. Faculty members across all medical school departments joined these 4 action groups to co-create and carry out all CWIMS gender equity initiatives. The process of developing the CWIMS center and action groups, the CBPR theoretical model guiding the approach, the initiatives developed by the action groups and metrics created, and the outcomes achieved to date are described. In addition, 4 lessons learned from the development of the CWIMS-use of theoretically driven and evidence-based models is key to building a sustainable organization; bottom-up and top-down engagement of partners is crucial for sustainability; passion and innovation are critical for long-term momentum; and not all faculty members and leaders will be enthusiastic about gender equity issues-are shared for the benefit of other medical schools wanting to develop similar centers.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2022,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,97,3,370EP  - 377,636041861,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004375,34469354,#843,Berge 2022,"",""
"A clinical study on the predictive value of preoperative KLIC score for debridement, antibiotic irrigation, and implant retention treatment outcome",Peng F.; ; Lei Z.; Beiyue W.; Nirong B.; Ting G.; Liwu Z.; Jianning Z.,"Objective. To explore KLIC (kidney, liver, index surgery, cemented prosthesis, and C reactive protein value) scoring system to predict the effect of debridement, antibiotic irrigation, and implant retention (DAIR) on acute peripheral prosthesis infection (PJI) accuracy and its clinical significance. Methods. Retrospective research was conducted from January 2015 to December 2020. A total of 44 patients (17 males and 27 females) aged 21-86 years, with acute PJI, underwent DAIR at the Department of Orthopedics, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine. Combined with medical history and test results, the preoperative KLIC score of the patients was calculated, and the patients were divided into five groups according to the following KLIC scores: <=2, 2.5-3.5, 4-5, 5.5-6.5, and >=7. The differences in baseline data, length of hospital stay, and DAIR treatment were compared among all groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the KLIC scoring system in predicting DAIR treatment outcomes. Kaplan-Meier was used to plot the success rate curve of DAIR treatment. Result. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, body mass index, lesion site and classification, duration of infection symptoms, and postoperative hospital stay among the five groups (all P values >0.05). The overall cure rate was 61.36% (27/44) and the failure rate was 38.64% (17/44). The failure rates of KLIC score <=2, 2-3.5, 4-5, 5.5-6.5 and >=7 were 0/8, 2/8, 5/13, 6/10 and 4/5, respectively, and a significant difference was observed between groups (P=0.018). Chi-square for trend test indicated that the failure rate of DAIR increased with the increase of the KLIC score, and the difference was statistically significant (chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>= 10.86, P=0.001). The ROC curve showed that the KLIC score had high accuracy in predicting the DAIR treatment outcome (AUC=0.876, 95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.978, P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve suggested that the cumulative treatment success rate of patients with KLIC score >=7 was lower than that of patients with KLIC score <7, and the difference was statistically significant (chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>=8.95, P=0.003). Conclusion. The KLIC score has good predictability for the treatment outcome of DAIR. For patients with acute PJI with a KLIC score >=7, the failure rate is high and DAIR is not recommended.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

"""They Wanted to Talk to a 'Real Doctor'"": Predictors, Perpetrators, and Experiences of Racial and Ethnic Discrimination Among Healthcare Workers",Hennein R.; ; Tineo P.; Bonumwezi J.; Gorman H.; Nguemeni Tiako M.J.; Lowe S.R.,"Background: Racial and ethnic diversity of healthcare workers have benefits on team functioning and patient care. However, a significant barrier to retaining diverse providers is discrimination. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess the predictors, perpetrators, and narratives of racial discrimination among healthcare workers. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Survey study. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Healthcare workers employed at academic hospitals. Main Measures: We assessed prevalence and perpetrators of racial and ethnic discrimination using the General Ethnic Discrimination Scale. We included an open-ended question asking respondents to recount experiences of discrimination and analyzed responses using grounded theory. Key Results: Of the 997 participants, 12.2% were females from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URM), 4.0% URM males, 10.1% Asian females, 4.7% Asian males, 49.1% non-Hispanic White females, and 19.8% non-Hispanic White males. Among healthcare workers of color, 85.2% reported discrimination. Over half of URM females (51.4%), URM males (52.6%), and Asian females (62.5%) reported discrimination by patients. About 20-25% of URM females, URM males, and Asian females reported discrimination by teachers, supervisors, co-workers, and institutions. In adjusted binary logistic models, URM females had 10.14 odds (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.13, 20.02, p<.001), URM males 6.23 odds (95%CI: 2.59, 14.98, p<.001), Asian females 7.90 odds (95%CI: 4.07, 15.33, p<.001), and Asian males 2.96 odds (95% CI: 1.47, 5.97, p=.002) of reporting discrimination compared with non-Hispanic White males. Needing more support was associated with 2.51 odds (95%CI: 1.54, 4.08, p<.001) of reporting discrimination.

Creating Inclusive and Accessible Residency Training programs: Lessons Learned from Establishing a Deaf and American Sign Language Inclusive Model for Residency Training,Hill C.S.; ; Deville C.; Kiess A.; Narang A.K.; Ratnanather T.; Bienstock J.; Brinckerhoff L.; Hodukavich A.; Anderson R.; Alcorn S.; DeWeese T.; Viswanathan A.; Page B.R.,"Purpose: There is a growing need for a more diverse physician workforce to address gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in medicine. Investigations into vulnerable populations, including African, Native, Hispanic, and rural Americans all have overwhelmingly shown that these groups have diminished access and increased barriers to receiving radiation treatment. Increasing diversity among physicians can help address health care disparities in underserved populations. Accessible and inclusive residency training programs are needed to promote recruitment and retention of underrepresented physician groups. However, limited attention has been given to the potential benefits of training physicians with differences other than gender, race, or ethnicity. Americans with a disability represent about 27% of the population, whereas 1%-3% of physician trainees report having a disability. In 2017, our program matched a Deaf resident who preferentially utilized American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate. However, to date, there had been no published strategies on how to create an ASL inclusive residency training program for Deaf trainees. Herein, we report the development of a Deaf and ASL-inclusive residency program to serve as a model, which can be tailored to meet the needs of other underrepresented physician trainees in radiation oncology. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In preparation, department leadership engaged key stakeholders and leaders within the university's health system and among the department faculty, residents, and staff as well as the incoming resident, which led to the development and implementation of an inclusive ASL training model for the program. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In this process, 5 important principles and steps were identified. First, the trainee should be directly engaged and involved as a primary and key collaborator as to any cultural, linguistic, or physical needs and preferences. Second, key stakeholders within the institution, including hospital and department leadership, should be engaged early, and involved in implementing and creating strategies. Third, with the trainee's input, efforts should be initiated to utilize resources internal and external to the institution, including institutional ADA officers, disability services, and training consultants. Fourth, cultural and communication expectations should be discussed with faculty and staff with the goal of creating an inclusive training culture for all participants. Finally, workspace accommodations that remove any physical barriers should be addressed based on the trainee's input. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Through collaborative efforts, a Deaf and ASL-signing resident was successfully integrated into the residency program.

BIAS AND ENDOSCOPY TURNOVER TIME IN A TERTIARY REFERRAL ACADEMIC CENTER ENDOSCOPY UNIT,Yu M.A.; ; Isenburg S.; Patel V.,"Introduction: Room turnover time (TOT) is a measurement of endoscopy unit efficiency and delays in procedures lead to wasted health care expenditures. Several factors have been identified to influence turnover time including communication, staffing, case complexity, and specific surgeon. Previous research has indicated stereotypes about perceptions of physicians based on their gender or experience. For instance, women in surgical subspecialties endure gender discrimination from conscious and unconscious bias, that produce obstacles to career development and lead to burnout. It is unclear if these biases affect work flow in an endoscopy unit. Here, we sought to evaluate if endoscopists gender or academic experience affected their endoscopy room turnover time. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We evaluated 2,917 inpatient and outpatient endoscopic procedures performed at our large academic tertiary care center between July 2019 and July 2021. TOT was calculated by taking the difference between a prior patient ""out of room time"" and the next patient ""in room time"". TOT was averaged for each endoscopist and T-tests were used to evaluate for any statistical difference between groups. Academic experience was differentiated by having 5 years or >5 years since completing GI fellowship, or holding a leadership position. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The average room TOT was 31:28 minutes amongst 26 different gastroenterology providers. There was no statistically significant difference in TOT by gender (p=0.99), serving in a leadership position (p=0.46), or being >5 years since completing fellowship (p=0.63). TOT was longest for advanced endoscopic procedures (p=0.025). TOT increased and case volume decreased in April and May 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Neither gender or years of academic experience were associated with differences in endoscopic room TOT. More research is needed in gender or professional bias as related to work flow in medicine. Our other future directions include identification and analysis of other endoscopy efficiency metrics for endoscopy suite quality improvement. References: Day, L.W et al.

Current understanding of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and potential interest in future trial to evaluate role of myo-inositol as ovulation induction agent - Stakeholder's surveys,Pundir J.; ; Dimitriou E.; Thangaratinam S.,"Study question: To assess awareness amongst consumers and gynaecologists on various aspects of PCOS and to explore the willingness to participate in a future trial of myo-inositol as an ovulation induction agent. Summary answer: Significant lack of awareness on various aspect of PCOS amongst consumers is concerning. Gynaecologists and consumers are keen on trial exploring myo-inositol in anovulatory PCOS. What is known already: Initial studies have reported that Myo-inositol can increase the frequency of menstruation and ovulation along with benefit with androgenic and glycaemic parameters in women with PCOS. There is a need for large, well designed and powered randomised controlled trial to evaluate the role of Myo-inositol as a fertility enhancing agent on its own and as an adjunct to clomiphene/letrozole in women with anovulatory PCOS. There has been a growing interest in patient and public involvement in setting research priorities to reduce the risk of discrepancy between what stakeholder's experience as important unanswered questions and those which are actually researched. Study design, size, duration: The surveys were hosted using on-line survey tool (www.surveymonkey.com) between Dec 2020 and April 2021, in the UK. Bespoke questionnaires were designed for the survey of gynaecologists (comprising of 27 questions) and the women with PCOS (comprising of 20 questions). These were peer reviewed and included, multiple choice questions, questions with a Likert scale response and open format questions. Ethical approval was provided by Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) ethics committee (Ref: QMERC2014/76). Participants/materials, setting, methods: The online clinician survey was a cross sectional study of gynaecologists who look after women with PCOS, and the consumer survey was a cross sectional study of the members of PCOS support organisation Verity. The data was collected using on-line survey tool and was summarised descriptively using numbers and percentages. For the descriptive statistics, we used absolute and relative frequencies, and we also used the median and the IQR to detect the most common answers. Main results and the role of chance: There were 244 responses; 104 gynaecologists and 140 consumers. Majority of the consumers were aware that, women with PCOS struggle with irregular cycles (94%); to loss/maintain weight (83%); and to conceive (85%). 81% were aware of risk of subfertility, however, only half were aware of risks associated with irregular menstrual cycles (51%), gestational diabetes (57%) and long-term risks such as diabetes (62%). 96% felt subfertility was an important issue, however, only 2/5th were aware of treatment options, a third were aware of need for USS monitoring whilst taking clomid tablets and that clomid tablets can only be used for 6-12 cycles. The clinician survey showed that 70% of the gynaecologists chose life-style measurements for the first line option and the second line options were 35% for clomiphene, 29% for clomiphene + metformin, followed by 21% for letrozole. 79% use USS to confirm ovulation and 60% by measuring serum progesterone; 37% monitor all cycles of ovulation induction whereas 41% monitor index cycle. Two thirds of the gynaecologists (72%) and majority of consumers (88%) agreed on the need to research myo-inositol for ovulation induction in PCOS and were willing to participate in such a study. Barriers for recruitment and retention were also explored. Limitations, reasons for caution: Clinician survey was unable to get the views of general practitioners and endocrinologists, who might have a different perspective particularly on non-reproductive outcomes. Consumer survey was online survey in English which can result in a selection bias and the views of women from other socio-economic and cultural backgrounds may differ. Wider implications of the findings: These surveys provide vital information in planning a definitive RCT on the role of myo-inositol in women with anovulatory PCOS trying to conceive. Further research tools need to be explored to provide better information and education to the women with PCOS particularly on the long-term risks associated with PCOS.",2022,/,Human Reproduction,37,Supplement 1,i475EP  - i476,638854809,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deac106.P-612,,#849,Pundir 2022,"",""
White Coat Study: Gender Bias in Emergency Medicine,Frisch S.; ; Cen E.; DeGuzman C.; Mody S.; Chung A.,"Learning Objectives: Assess the prevalence of selfreported gender bias in EM physicians and strategies in personal care and appearance that are used to overcome them. <ovid:br/>Background(s): Female and nonbinary (NB) emergency medicine (EM) physicians experience gender discrimination.

Why are women still leaving academic medicine? A qualitative study within a London Medical School,Salem V.; ; Hirani D.; Lloyd C.; Regan L.; Peters C.J.,"Objectives To identify factors that influenced women who chose to leave academic medicine. Design and main outcome measures Independent consultants led a focus group of women in medicine who had left academia after completion of their postgraduate research degree at Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. Thematic analysis was performed on the transcribed conversations. Participants and setting Nine women physicians who completed a postgraduate degree (MD or PhD) at a large London Medical School and Academic Health Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, but did not go on to pursue a career in academic medicine. Results Influences to leave clinical academia were summarised under eight themes - career intentions, supervisor support, institutional human resources support, inclusivity, work-life balance, expectations, mentors and role models, and pregnancy and maternity leave. Conclusion The women in our focus group reported several factors contributing to their decision to leave clinical academia, which included lack of mentoring tailored to specific needs, low levels of acceptance for flexible working to help meet parental responsibilities and perceived explicit gender biases. We summarise the multiple targeted strategies that Imperial College London has implemented to promote retention of women in academic medicine, although more research needs to be done to ascertain the most effective interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

FAMILY BUILDING AND PARENTHOOD ALTERS THE CAREER TRAJECTORY OF WOMEN IN MEDICINE,Bakkensen J.B.; ; Lawson A.K.; Smith K.S.; Moreno P.I.; Cheung E.O.; Goldman K.N.; Feinberg E.C.,"Objective: Although most medical school graduates are women, pervasive gender disparities exist in time to promotion, achievement of academic rank, and appointment to leadership positions, with no narrowing of this gap over time. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which women in medicine alter their career trajectories and family building plans in order to balance parenthood and career. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): A survey was electronically distributed to female physicians through a national social media campaign from March 2022-April 2022. Descriptive data on demographics, household responsibilities, family building, and career considerations were collected using multiple choice items and Likert-type scales. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 741 female physicians completed the survey including 512 attendings, 66 fellows, and 89 residents from academic, private, and community practice settings (mean age = 38.8 years, SD = 7.69). The majority were heterosexual (n = 670, 90.4%), married/partnered (n = 632, 85.3%), and had children (n = 496, 66.9%). Seventy-nine percent reported having delayed or are currently delaying family building due to medical training or career. Among those who specified the duration of delay, 46.2% delayed 0-3 years, 31.4% 3-5 years, and 22.4% >=5 years. The most commonly cited factors influencing timing of childbearing either ""moderately,"" ""very much,"" or ""extremely"" were lack of schedule flexibility (76.0%), lack of time (71.2%), stress (69.7%), and concern about burdening colleagues (49.3%). Thirty-nine percent of respondents had considered egg/embryo freezing for fertility preservation, and 12.6% had frozen eggs/embryos. Most women (61.1%) stated they were responsible for >= 50% of household maintenance roles (e.g. cleaning, groceries, cooking, laundry), and 57.3% stated they were responsible for >= 50% of family maintenance (e.g. childcare, eldercare, healthcare appointments, school forms), despite twice as many reporting personally working >= 60 hours/week vs. having a partner who worked >= 60 hours/week (27.8% vs. 13.6%, p<0.05). In order to accommodate childbearing or parenthood, 34.1% did not take opportunities for career advancement, 33.3% reduced their work hours, 20.5% chose a different specialty, and 18.5% changed their work setting (academic vs. private practice). Twenty-two women (3.0%) had left medicine entirely. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this large national survey of female physicians from diverse specialties and practice locations, respondents cited significant career-related pressures coupled with increased household responsibilities that influenced the timing of childbearing and reported marked alterations in career trajectory to accommodate family building and parenthood. Impact Statement: Persistent gender disparities exist in leadership and faculty ranks within academic medicine despite equal matriculation into medical school. Preliminary data from the largest national survey to date characterizes the accommodations made among women in medicine to balance family building and career which may contribute to ongoing academic disparities and attrition.

51 Gender and Clinician Type: Who Is Leaving the Emergency Workforce?,Gettel C.; ; Courtney D.M.; Agrawal P.; Madsen T.; Venkatesh A.,"Background: Prior emergency workforce analyses have failed to present granular data stratified by gender despite reports of gender-based differences in burnout and non-clinical domestic responsibilities. We sought to identify trends between 2013 and 2019 in: 1) the workforce's proportional composition by gender and clinician type - emergency medicine (EM) physician, non-emergency physician and Advanced Practice Provider (APP), and 2) the amount of clinicians leaving the workforce by gender. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a repeated cross-sectional analysis of emergency clinicians receiving reimbursement for at least 50 Evaluation & Management (E/M) services [99281-99285] from Medicare Part B. Stratified by gender and clinician type, we calculated the emergency workforce's annual attrition. Attrition captured clinicians leaving temporarily and permanently, respectively defined as clinicians not meeting the reimbursement threshold for E/M services in the immediate subsequent year or all subsequent years in the study performance time period. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 2013 to 2019, 50,456 male and 32,209 female clinicians performed at least 50 E/M services within one of the study years, including 47,108 emergency physicians, 9,047 non-emergency physicians, and 26,510 APPs. Among all clinicians, females made up an increasing proportion of the overall workforce (31.7% in 2013; 36.5% in 2019), as well as component part of the emergency physician workforce (25.2% in 2013; 28.3% in 2019), the non-emergency physician workforce (16.9% in 2013; 19.3% in 2019), and the APP workforce (60.7% in 2013; 62.5% in 2019). Of all female clinicians, APPs made up an increasing proportion of the workforce, rising from 39.9% in 2013 to 44.6% in 2019. Of all male clinicians, APPs made up an increasing proportion of the workforce, rising from 12.0% in 2013 to 15.4% in 2019. The number of male clinicians leaving the workforce increased from 2,736 in 2013 to 2,931 in 2019 (a 7.1% increase), while the number of female clinicians leaving the workforce increased from 1,856 in 2013 to 2,711 in 2019 (a 46.1% increase). Among female clinicians, emergency physicians comprised 24.1% of clinicians leaving the workforce in 2013 and 20.1% in 2019, while APPs comprised 66.9% of clinicians leaving the workforce in 2013 and 73.6% in 2019. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female clinicians comprised approximately one-third of the emergency clinician workforce by 2019, with the increase from 2013 driven by a greater number of female APPs. Three-quarters of the male clinicians in the workforce were emergency physicians, while approximately one-half of the female clinicians in the workforce were emergency physicians. Over recent years, a substantially greater proportion of female clinicians left the emergency workforce compared to their male counterparts.

"Impacts of the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition on diagnostic coding of post-traumatic headache (PTH) in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): Age, gender, and physician effects",Kimber A.L.; ; Fenton B.T.; Phadke M.; Wang K.; Ney J.P.; Seng E.K.; Lorenze N.; Grinberg A.S.; Sico J.J.,"One sentence summary: During the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition, coding of post-traumatic headache in the Veterans Health Administration is inconsistent with variation by gender, age, and the clinic type patients saw within ICD-10. <ovid:br/>Background(s): This study aims to understand how the transition from the 9th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) to the 10th version (ICD-10) affected coding of PTH in the VHA. We examined both patient and clinic level factors influencing PTH coding, and the agreement between clinical impression and ICD-codes. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In combination with administrative data, this retrospective chart review identified 2,195 patients with a PTH diagnosis in the last two years of ICD-9 (10/01/13-09/ 30/15). Each veteran had 2 outpatient visits selected from the last 2 fiscal years of ICD-9 and another 2 from the first 2 years of ICD-10 (10/01/13-09/ 30/17). Medicare Generalized Equivalency Maps were used to determine equivalent ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes (Table). The abstracted clinical impression was compared with VHA electronic health record data diagnoses for one headache visit in ICD-10. Agreement was measured with Cohen's kappa. Patients with PTH diagnosis in ICD-9 were classified based on whether they had 1) a PTH code in both ICD-9 and 10 (retained diagnosis), 2) a headache diagnosis other than PTH in ICD-10 (changed diagnosis), or 3) no headache diagnosis coded in ICD-10 (lost diagnosis). Descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests were completed in SAS 9.4. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Only 18.3% retained their PTH diagnosis in ICD-10 (N = 401), while 45.4% of patients had no headache diagnosis coded in the ICD-10 period. Among the 36.3% with a changed diagnosis in ICD-10 (N = 797), the majority were coded to either headache not-otherwise specified (NOS) (55.6%) and/or migraine (50.7%). In the patients with a reviewed clinical impression, there was moderate agreement with the ICD-10 code (PTH jappa = 0.53, 95% CI [0.48, 0.59], Migraine jappa = 0.54 CI [0.48, 0.60], NOS jappa = 0.46 CI [0.40, 0.52]).13.6% of patients with a clinical impression of PTH in ICD-10 did not have an ICD-10 diagnosis of PTH. In both time periods and for all 3 ICD-10 classifications, primary care was seen most frequently for headache. Women were more likely to have a PTH diagnosis change to another headache type in ICD-10, while men were more likely to retain PTH diagnosis or have no headache coded in ICD-10. Older patients were significantly more likely to have no headache diagnosis coded in ICD-10. Based on the first headache visit in ICD-10, patients seen by primary care, neurology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation were most likely to have their PTH diagnosis changed in ICD-10 (44.5%, 50.5%, and 37.6%). Patients with PTH in ICD-9 that were seen in ICD-10 by psychiatry, the emergency room, or pain clinic were more likely to have no headache diagnoses coded (92.1%, 78.1%, and 53.9%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): With the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition, PTH coding is inconsistent with variation by gender, age, and clinic type. In the selected short time window, changes are unlikely due to resolved PTH. Rather, many observations are likely due to coding issues such as 1) diagnosing headache phenotype rather than assessing secondary causes of headache, 2) assigning unspecific headache diagnoses rather than reviewing patient notes, or 3) recoding reimbursable claims due to insufficient documentation in individual headache notes. Efforts to improve coding and documentation are warranted to ensure accuracy of PTH and access to specialized care.

ASCO oral presenters five years later: Leaks in the pipeline?,Kwong F.; ; Lerner K.; Tao D.L.; Patel S.; Prasad V.,"Background: There is growing awareness of the challenges of retaining oncologists engaged in research, and this leaky academic pipeline is most notable for women in medicine. Studying academic oncologists is challenging due to their many affiliations, but with an estimated attendance of over 30,000 oncologists, the ASCO annual meeting is a highly sought-after stage for presenting new research. To better understand the continued research engagement of oncologists active in research, we used public data from ASCO annual meetings to follow a cohort of oral abstract presenters over 5 years. <ovid:br/>Method(s): To define our initial cohort of oncologists engaged in research, we used the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting Digital Program to identify first author oral abstract presenters. We tracked if each presenter was subsequently listed as an author of any research type (oral abstract session, poster session, education session, etc.) at the 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 ASCO conferences. We then filtered out researchers who were not listed as authors at ASCO in consecutive years to look at only those researchers who continued to have active ASCO involvement. To evaluate by gender, each presenter's name was referenced with the publicly available Wiki-Gendersort tool for an unbiased assignment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 209 first author oral abstract presenters were identified at the 2016 ASCO conference. We found that 67.9% of the initial 209 researchers were listed as authors at ASCO in 2017, 55.5% continued to be authors in 2018, 46.9% in 2019, 42.6% in 2020, and only 38.3% were still listed as authors 5 years later in 2021. When looking at sustained first authorship, 8.1% of the initial 209 research cohort continued to be listed as first authors for 5 consecutive years through 2021. We also looked at the breakdown of other types of ASCO presentations and found that 122 of the initial 209 research cohort presented posters in 2016. Of these 122 researchers, 60 (49.2%) remained authors of posters throughout the consecutive 5 years. This is significantly higher than the number of researchers who continued to author oral abstracts in 2021 49.2% vs. 3.8% (P < 0.0001). When evaluating the differences between gender, there were approximately twice as many men presenters as women (122 men vs 65 women; 22 names were unisex or unknown). The rate of retention was similar for men (47 of the initial 122 males, 38.5%) and women (25 of the initial 65 females, 38.5%) at 5 years (P = 1). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We conducted a descriptive study evaluating the rate of sustained activity in academic oncology over 5 years. Our research suggests that about one-third of ASCO presenters will continue to have sustained yearly authorship at 5 years post-oral abstract presentation.

Assessing Pediatric Faculty Perceptions of Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment,Slater A.C.; ; Thomas A.; Quan L.; Bell S.; Bradford M.C.; Rosenberg A.R.; Walker-Harding L.R.,"Background: Background Physicians who identify as women experience gender discrimination and sexual harassment in academic medicine. Although Pediatrics has reported more women than men since 1989, it is likely that gender-based inequities exist. We aimed to examine hospital-based pediatricians' experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Methods An anonymous survey was distributed to all faculty in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington. Survey items included demographic data and a modified version of the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work (ODGW) Scale, questions about the frequency with which the faculty member experienced/witnessed discriminatory treatment, and questions about experiences with sexual harassment. Surveys also asked whether these experiences negatively impacted confidence and career advancement. We hypothesized that women would report more discrimination and harassment than men. Responses were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Male and female responses were compared using Chi squared tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results Of 524 Pediatrics faculty, 290 (55%) completed the survey. Women more commonly reported feeling they have been treated unfairly due to gender than men (50% vs. 4%, p<0.01) and feeling gender was a limitation (35% vs. 4%, p<0.01). Women also reported discriminatory treatment at least annually (51% vs. 4%, p<0.01) and reported encountering sexist remarks, unwanted attention, or advances (24% vs. 15%, p=0.08). More women reported that these discriminatory experiences negatively impacted their confidence and their career advancement (48% and 50%, respectively) compared to men (12% and 9%, p<0.01).

Recognizing Gender Parity in Military Medicine: An Analysis of Plenary Speakers and Award Recipients at Military American College of Physicians Chapter Meetings,Conte L.M.; ; Hartzell J.D.; Mount C.A.; Carroll M.B.; Tschanz M.; Stadler D.J.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the advances toward gender parity in medicine, a gap exists in the recognition of women physicians at academic and subspecialty medical conferences as plenary speakers and award winners. Conferences are cornerstones in the practice of medicine because they serve as platforms to showcase physicians' successes and disseminate work. The selection of who is honored at such events can impact an individual's career by creating networks that may lead to future opportunities. Additionally, the trend of who is honored may create expectations in the minds of trainees and early career physicians about what qualities help an individual achieve success. Our group sought to determine whether there was a gender gap in award recognition and speakership opportunities at the American College of Physicians (ACP) annual military chapter meetings. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional study with data extracted from publicly available conference programs for the Army-Air Force annual ACP meetings and the Navy annual ACP meetings. Five years of data erewere reviewed for invited plenary speakers. Ten years of data were reviewed for award recipients. For an award to be included, it had to have a preset description and criteria for recipient selection. Awards not given annually or awards given for less than 3 years were excluded. Individuals' gender was determined based on the first name and confirmed through internet searches of pronoun descriptors from professional websites. Comparisons were done using Fisher's exact test and chi-square tests when appropriate, with statistical significance set at a two-tailed P-value of <.05. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Women comprised 26-30% of the chapter membership and there was no significant difference in gender distribution between the chapters. Fourteen of the 69 plenary speakers were women (20%), with significantly fewer women presenters in the Navy as compared to men. Thirty-six of the 134 award winners were women (27%), which was not significantly different from the overall chapter gender distributions. While women recipients of lifetime, teaching, research, and medical student awards were not significantly different from chapter gender distribution, women faculty were significantly more likely to receive an award for teaching than for research, with women receiving 13 of the 28 teaching awards (41%), and none of the 10 faculty research awards. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The military chapter ACP meetings reviewed mirrored civilian data in many ways, although military plenary speaker and award recipient distributions were more representative of the gender distribution of the branches. Review of the nomination process, planning committee selection, and opportunities for diversity training could be optimized to ensure that future conferences have a gender-balanced representation of individuals being honored.

Where is your lactation room? Lactation policies and practices in oncology trainee and early career physicians,Malapati S.J.; ; Singh S.R.K.; Idossa D.; Bruno X.J.; Chino F.; Patel M.A.; Wei Z.; Duma N.,"Background: Training and early career years coincide with childbearing and raising young families, which places increased demands on new parents. With increasing numbers of female oncologists in the workforce, there is a need to assess and amend current workplace lactation policies. We surveyed Medical and Radiation Oncology trainees and early career faculty to assess policies and practices regarding lactation during training and early career. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An anonymous 48 question cross-sectional survey developed by researchers with expertise in gender equity was distributed via email and social media channels between May and June 2021 to oncology trainees and physicians within 5 years of terminal training; program directors (PDs) were surveyed separately. Descriptive statistics were used. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 255 complete responses, 26% (65) respondents breastfed for any length of time upon return to work. Of these, 54% (35) were trainees and 46% (30) early career faculty. 69% (45) had access to a designated lactation room; however, 57% (37) noted that duration of their pumping breaks was inadequate to access and use the lactation room. Most (60%, 39) did not feel comfortable asking for protected time to pump. Employment contracts did not specifically include pumping breaks for 66% (43), while 34% (22) were unsure about their contract policies surrounding lactation. Of all breastfeeding mothers, 77% (50) felt their colleagues to be supportive of their needs; a minority reported negative responses due to pumping breaks from faculty (11%), co-fellows/colleagues (8%) and clinic staff (15%). 51% (33) bought a wearable pump prior to return to work, of which 70% (23) found it financially burdensome. Most common reasons for buying a wearable pump were to improve efficiency during work hours (61%, 20) and lack of adequate pumping breaks (39%, 13). Among 23 PDs who responded to the survey, 65% (15) had a program policy regarding lactating trainees, 9% (2) blocked clinic appointments to allow pumping breaks, 91% (21) provided lactation rooms, 83% (19) reported the lactation rooms are easily accessible. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Both infrastructure and time accommodations made for the lactating parent are inadequate. There is a disconnect between the trainee and PDs' perception of provided accommodations.

Gender disparity persists in pain medicine: A crosssectional study of chairpersons within ACGMEaccredited chronic pain fellowship programs in the United States,King R.; ; D'Souza R.; Olatoye O.,"Learning objectives (1) Upon completion, participants will be able to discuss gender disparities among leadership in academic interventional pain fellowships. (2) Upon completion, participants will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the importance of a diverse workforce in interventional pain medicine as it relates to patient care. (3) Upon completion, participants will be able to discuss the importance of diverse leadership in academic interventional pain fellowship programs in generating a diverse workforce. Purpose The importance of gender equity among medical providers is becoming increasingly recognized within academia. Attaining a diverse workforce in healthcare has been linked to reduced health disparities, increased trust in the healthcare system by marginalized patient groups, and increased provider comfort with diverse patient populations. While gender representation among medical students has seen significant improvements with women now representing slightly over half of all medical students, gender gaps remain a significant issue among trainees, providers and leaders of various medical specialties including pain medicine. In 2019, less than 20% of all active physicians practicing within pain medicine identified as females. More recently, a study showed roughly 30% of chronic pain medicine fellowship programs had a female program director. Despite these findings, the degree of gender disparity among leadership ranks within pain medicine, specifically departmental and divisional chairpersons, has yet to be studied. The importance of female representation within pain medicine leadership ranks cannot be overstated. It is likely to foster an inherent attraction of talented female trainees to the field, promote interest in academia, provide a mentorship pipeline essential to success in academia, and facilitate retention of female providers within the field. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to assess gender disparity within chairpersons of ACGME-accredited chronic pain medicine programs across the country and its associations with various demographic, academic, and program metrics. We hypothesize that female chairpersons would be under-represented and that they would have fewer academic accomplishments including less publications and lower academic rank status. Methods We identified all chronic pain fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) on 4/19/2021. We queried institutional websites or contacted programs directly to identify the respective departmental/divisional program chairperson After determining the final list of chairperson names, we utilized publicly available sources including fellowship program websites, state licensure boards, and online curriculum vitae to identify the chairperson's age, gender, academic degree (MD, PhD, and/or MBA), academic rank (professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor), number of publications and Hirsch-index (H-index), board certification status (initial or continued), and residency training specialty (anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, psychiatry, emergency medicine). The ACGME website was queried to abstract data on the following variables: total approved and filled fellow positions, and fellowship program accreditation status. The primary outcome included comparisons of the following demographic, academic, and program-related characteristics between female and male program chairpersons: (1) Demographic characteristics: Age, geographic location (Midwest, Northeast, South, West). Geographic regions were determined based on the United States Census Bureau Regions and Divisions (2) Academic characteristics: Academic rank, dual appointment as chairperson and program director, completion of MD/ PhD degree, completion of MBA degree, duration of clinical practice, number of publications, H-index, board certification status, chairperson residency training specialty (3) Program characteristics: number of approved fellow positions, number of filled fellow positions, program accreditation status Continuous outcomes were reported as medians with a 25- 75% interquartile range (IQR), while dichotomous categorical outcomes are reported as numbers with percentages. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to compare continuous outcomes between female and male chairpersons, while the Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between female and male chairpersons. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the Mayo institutional review board (IRB). The requirement for written informed consent was waived. Results Identification and Selection of Chairperson We identified a total of 111 ACGME-accredited chronic pain fellowship programs at the time of study initiation (4/19/21). Chairperson name was obtained from the departmental and/ or institutional website for a total of 80 programs. An additional seven fellowship programs provided the chairperson name and contact information after we contacted them via e-mail and/or phone call. Twenty-four programs did not provide chairperson information as they did not respond to e-mail or phone requests. Demographic Characteristics of Chairpersons Our overall cohort comprised of 17 female chairpersons (19.5%) and 70 male chairpersons (80.5%). No differences in age were detected between female and male chairpersons (P = 0.645). The proportion of female and male chairpersons based on geographic location was similar. Academic Characteristics of Chairpersons Based on Gender When comparing academic characteristics based on gender, a higher proportion of female chairpersons (35.3%) reported an academic rank of assistant professor compared to male chairpersons (11.4%, P = 0.027). However, similar proportions of other academic rankings (senior academic rank, full professor, associate professor, and instructor position) were noted between female and male chairpersons. Male chairpersons published more peer-reviewed articles (32.0 publications, 10.0-92.0 IQR) compared to female chairpersons (10.0 publications, 2.5-17.5 IQR, P = 0.001). Concordantly, male chairpersons achieved a higher H-index score (10.0, 5.0-28.0 IQR) compared to female chairpersons (3.0, 1.0-6.0 IQR; P = 0.001). There were no differences in other academic characteristics including dual appointment as program director, academic degrees (PhD, MBA), years in clinic practice, board certification status, and primary residency training specialty. Program-related Characteristics Based on Gender The ACGME reported one program was assigned probationary accreditation. Six (6.9%) programs had initial ACGME accreditation status, while 80 (92.0%) had continued ACGME accreditation status. No differences in fellow positions and program accreditation status were identified when stratified by chairperson gender. Conclusion Female representation in pain medicine leadership and clinicians is crucial. Population-based research has demonstrated that pain prevalence is generally higher among women relative to men, and it is not uncommon for pain practices to have a greater composition of female patients Furthermore, research has demonstrated that patient-physician gender concordance may be associated with greater patient satisfaction scores Thus, female patients may be able to relate more to female providers caring for them. This association is also reflected in the leadership setting, where female program directors are more likely to have female fellows in the pain program they lead. Our study demonstrates that this important role is currently and overwhelmingly held by males within the specialty of pain medicine with significant underrepresentation among female physicians. This disparity is also reflected in other academic metrics including number of peer-reviewed publications, H-indices, and attainment of assistant professor rank. This study highlights the need for continued measures designed to address and eliminate barriers that persistently preclude female representation from leadership positions within our specialty.",2022,/,Postgraduate Medicine,134,Supplement 2,1EP  - 3,639321516,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2022.2116839,,#859,King 2022,"",""
The Leaky Pipeline: Female Physician Attrition from Academic Medicine Across the US,Chen Y.-W.; ; Bolanos C.O.; Chang D.C.; Kelleher C.M.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to investigate gender differences in attrition rate between male and female physicians working in academia. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): All physicians who billed Medicare from a teaching hospital in March 2014 were included and were followed up until December 2019. Physicians who retired during the study period were excluded. The primary outcome was leaving academia and was defined as not having billed Medicare from a teaching hospital for more than 1 year. The primary independent variable was physician gender. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted, adjusting for physician experience, medical school ranking, specialty (surgery vs nonsurgery), and region of the country. Stratified subset analyses were also performed for the variables listed above. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 294,963 physicians included, 30.5% female. The overall attrition rate was 34.2% after 5 years, 38.3% and 32.4% for female and male physicians, respectively. Female physicians had higher attrition rate than their male counterparts across every career stage (Figure). On the adjusted analysis, female physicians were 25% more likely to leave academia than their male counterparts (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.28). The results were qualitatively similar on all subset analyses. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Female physicians are more likely to leave academia than male physicians at all career stages, in all regions of the country, in both surgical and nonsurgical specialties, and regardless of medical school ranking. Successful diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts should address attrition in addition to pipeline issues.

Composition and Gender Distribution of Editorial Boards for Top Neurosurgical Journals,Kearns K.; ; Rabinovich E.; Shabo L.; Shaffrey M.E.; Jane J.A.; Park M.S.,"INTRODUCTION: Women are underrepresented in academic medicine, most notably in surgical subspecialties. Despite increasing numbers of female neurosurgery residents, female neurosurgeons are not obtaining competitive national positions at comparable rates. Serving as a journal editor is one measure of academic success. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional study of editorial boards for the top 10 English-language neurosurgical journals (Journal of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery, JNS: Spine, World Neurosurgery, Neurosurgical Focus, JNS: Pediatrics, Acta Neurochirurgica, Surgical Neurology International, Neurosurgical Review, and Neurosurgical Clinics). Board members were identified from journal websites. Data was obtained from journal websites, program faculty lists, or physician online profiles. Editors with medical degrees (MD or equivalent) were included. Gender differences were compared using Student's t-test and chi-squared analysis. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 722 board members were examined (female n=65; male n=650; unidentified n=7). Overall, women had fewer years in practice (p=0.002) while men were more likely to have additional degrees (p=0.009) and to have higher h-indices (p<0.0001). Within the editorial boards of Neurosurgery and Acta Neurochirurgica, men were more likely to have been in practice longer (p=0.014;p=0.023), and to have higher h-indices (p=0.003;p=0.025). Male editors for JNS: Spine and World Neurosurgery were more likely to have higher h-indices (p=0.007;p=0.018). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Women constitute ~8% of the editorial boards for top neurosurgical journals. While this is comparable to the amount of practicing female academic neurosurgeons, much needs to be done to achieve gender parity in competitive, high-ranking positions. The differences in years in practice and h-index suggest that this discrepancy may improve with time as more women enter practice and produce scientific literature. Efforts to recruit and retain women in neurosurgery should be pursued to rectify this discrepancy.",2022,/,Clinical Neurosurgery,68,SUPPL 1,29,637828603,,,#861,Kearns 2022,"",""
U.S. radiation oncology and medical oncology department faculty diversity trends by sex and underrepresented in medicine status over five decades,Kamran S.C.; ; Niemierko A.; Vapiwala N.,"Background: Academic faculty are critical in training future generations of oncologists to care for our increasingly diverse cancer patient population. It is unclear if the growing imperative to address disparities in racial/ethnic and gender representation in the medical field has resulted in corresponding progress in the composition of academic radiation and medical oncology (RO, MO) departments. Herein we report trends in faculty diversity, overall and by academic rank, among US radiation and medical oncologists over the past 5 decades. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data were acquired from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster between 1970-2019 for academic RO and MO departments to determine sex and race/ethnicity trends over five decades. Underrepresented in Medicine (URM) was defined as individuals identifying as Black, Hispanic, and Native American. Linear regression models were used to estimate slopes and associated pvalues. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Total faculty complements grew over time in both RO and MO departments. The number of URM female faculty increased by 0.85/year in RO and 0.79/year in MO (Ptrend< 0.001), compared to non-URM female faculty, which increased by 11.3/year in RO and 7.9 in MO (P-trend<0.001). URM male faculty increased by 1.4/year in RO and 1.1/year in MO (P-trend<0.001), compared to non-URM male faculty, which increased by 25.5/year for RO and 12.2/year for MO (P-trend<0.001). Males represented the majority of URM and non-URM faculty for both RO and MO. The proportion of females grew more than the proportion of URM faculty over the study period for both RO and MO. There were also significant differences in diversity by faculty rank. Although MO outperformed RO in terms of the proportion of female faculty members with more advanced rank, female faculty members had a lower academic rank than their male counterparts in both specialties. At every rank, there was a low number of URM faculty represented among both MO and RO (Table). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender and racial/ethnic diversity of academic RO and MO faculty has increased over time but has not kept pace with the diversity of the US population served, particularly with respect to URM status. The proportion of female faculty in both specialties demonstrates more promising growth, and may inform measures to achieve similar progress in recruiting and retaining URM faculty in both MO and RO.",2021,/,Journal of Clinical Oncology,39,15 SUPPL,,635590928,https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.11010,,#864,Kamran 2021,"",""
Research productivity of radiation therapy physics faculty in the United States,Meeks S.L.; ; Shang M.H.; Willoughby T.R.; Kelly P.; Shah A.P.,"PURPOSE: Research productivity metrics are important for decisions regarding hiring, retention, and promotion in academic medicine, and these metrics can vary widely among different disciplines. This article examines productivity metrics for radiation therapy physicists (RTP) in the United States. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Database searches were performed for RTP faculty at US institutions that have RTP residencies accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP). Demographics, academic rank, number of publications, academic career length, Hirsch index (h-index), m-quotient, and history of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding as a principal investigator (PI) were collected for each RTP. Logistic regression was performed to determine the probability of academic rank as a function of h-index and m-quotient. Statistical tests used included the Wilcoxon ranked sum test and the Pearson chi2 test. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 1038 faculty and staff were identified at 78 institutions with CAMPEP-accredited residencies. The average RTP academic career duration is 13.5 years, with 46.7 total publications, h-index of 10.7, and m-quotient of 0.66. Additionally, 10.5% of RTP have a history of NIH funding as a PI. Large disparities were found in academic productivity of doctoral-prepared physicists compared to those with a terminal master's degree. For differences in junior and senior faculty, statistical tests yielded significance in career duration, number of publications, h-index, and m-quotient. Gender disparities were identified in the overall distribution of RTP consistent with the membership of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Further gender disparities were found in the number of doctoral-prepared RTP and physicists in senior faculty roles. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This manuscript provides objective benchmark data regarding research productivity of academic RTP.

Advancing women to leadership positions through individual actions and institutional reform,Alli A.; ; Lin T.; Thorndyke L.E.; Parekh R.; Nunez A.,"Women in medicine experience disparities in the workplace and in achieving leadership roles. They face challenges related to climate and culture, equitable compensation, work-life integration, opportunities for professional development and advancement, and occupational and systemic factors that can lead to burnout. Without specific resources to support women's development and advancement and promote conducive workplace climates, efforts to recruit, retain, and promote women physicians into leadership roles may be futile. This article is designed for 2 audiences: women physicians of all career stages, who are exploring factors that may adversely impact their advancement opportunities, and leaders in academic medicine and health care, who seek to achieve inclusive excellence by fully engaging talent. The need for greater representation of women leaders in medicine is both a moral and a business imperative that requires systemic changes.

Sex Differences in Academic Productivity Across Academic Ranks and Specialties in Academic Medicine A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Ha G.L.; ; Lehrer E.J.; Wang M.; Holliday E.; Jagsi R.; Zaorsky N.G.,"IMPORTANCE Despite equal numbers of men and women entering medical school, women are underrepresented in the upper echelons of academic medicine and receive less compensation and research funding. Citation-related publication productivity metrics, such as the h-index, are increasingly used for hiring, salary, grants, retention, promotion, and tenure decisions. Exploring sex differences in these metrics across academic medicine provides deeper insight into why differences are observed in career outcomes. OBJECTIVE To systematically examine the available literature on sex differences in h-index of academic faculty physicians across all medical specialties and all levels of academic rank. DATA SOURCES Medical literature with the term h-index found in PubMed and published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, was used. STUDY SELECTION A PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), and MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) selection protocol was used to find observational studies that published h-indexes for faculty physicians that were stratified by sex. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, retracted, or unavailable online. Ultimately, 14 of 786 studies (1.78%) met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data from 9 studies across 16 specialties were examined using weighted random-effects meta-Analyses. Five studies were excluded because of overlapping specialties with another study or because they were missing appropriate statistics for the metaanalysis. Four of these studies were included in qualitative synthesis to bring the total to 13 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was the h-index. RESULTS The meta-Analysis included 10 665 North American unique academic physicians across 9 different studies from the years 2009 to 2018. Of the 10 665 physicians, 2655 (24.89%) were women. Summary effect sizes for mean h-indexes of men and women and mean h-index difference between men and women were determined for all faculty physicians and at each academic rank. Overall, female faculty had lower h-indexes than male faculty (mean difference, ?4.09; 95%CI, ?5.44 to ?2.73; P > .001). When adjusting for academic rank, female faculty still had lower h-indexes than male faculty at the ranks of assistant professor (mean difference, ?1.3; 95%CI, ?1.90 to ?0.72; P > .001), associate professor (mean difference, ?2.09; 95%CI, ?3.40 to ?0.78; P = .002), and professor (mean difference, ?3.41; 95%CI, ?6.24 to ?0.58; P = .02).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 American Medical Association.

"State of women in medicine: History, challenges, and the benefits of a diverse workforce",Joseph M.M.; ; Ahasic A.M.; Clark J.; Templeton K.,"Women in medicine have made progress since Elizabeth Blackwell: the first women to receive her medical degree in the United States in 1849. Yet although women currently represent just over one-half of medical school applicants and matriculates, they continue to face many challenges that hinder them from entering residency, achieving leadership positions that exhibit final decision-making and budgetary power, and, in academic medicine, being promoted. Challenges include gender bias in promotion, salary inequity, professional isolation, bullying, sexual harassment, and lack of recognition, all of which lead to higher rates of attrition and burnout in women physicians. These challenges are even greater for women from groups that have historically been marginalized and excluded, in all aspects of their career and especially in achieving leadership positions. It is important to note that, in several studies, it was indicated that women physicians are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, provide preventive care and psychosocial counseling, and spend more time with their patients than their male peers. Additionally, some studies reveal improved clinical outcomes with women physicians. Therefore, it is critical for health care systems to promote workforce diversity in medicine and support women physicians in their career development and success and their wellness from early to late career.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the American Academy of Pediatrics",2021,/,Pediatrics,148,"(Joseph) Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, College of Medicine-Jacksonville, University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL, United States(Ahasic) Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, ",e2021051440C,2014459453,https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-051440C,34470878,#869,Joseph 2021,"",""
Capacity Building of Health Professionals on Genetics and Genomics Practice: Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Distance Learning Training Course for Italian Physicians,Calabro G.E.; ; Tognetto A.; Mazzaccara A.; Barbina D.; Carbone P.; Guerrera D.; Di Pucchio A.; Federici A.; Ricciardi W.; Boccia S.,"Background: The rapid spread of personalized medicine requires professionals to manage the ""omics revolution."" Therefore, the genetics/genomics literacy of healthcare professionals should be in line with the continuous advances in this field, in order to implement its potential implications for diagnosis, control and treatment of diseases. The present study investigates the effectiveness of a distance learning course on genetics and genomics targeted at medical doctors. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In the context of a project funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, we developed a distance learning course, entitled Genetics and Genomics practice. The course focused on genetic/genomics testing, pharmacogenetics and oncogenomics and was developed according to andragogical training methods (Problem-based Learning and Case-based Learning). We used a pre-test vs. post-test study design to assess knowledge improvement on a set of 10 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). We analyzed the proportion of correct answers for each question pre and post-test and the mean score difference stratified by gender, age, professional status and medical discipline. Moreover, the test was submitted to the participants 8 months after the conclusion of the course (follow-up), in order to assess the retained knowledge. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The course was completed by 1,637 Italian physicians, most of which were primary care physicians (20.8%), public health professionals (11.5%) and specialist pediatricians (10.6%). The proportion of correct answers increased in the post-test for all the MCQs. The overall mean score significantly increased, from 59.46 in the pre-test to 71.42 in the post-test (p < 0.0001). The comparison in test performance between follow-up and pre-test demonstrated an overall knowledge improvement. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Genomics literacy among healthcare professionals is essential to ensure optimal translation to healthcare delivery of research.

Framework for advancing equity in academic medicine and science: Perspectives from early career female faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic,Spencer S.; ; Burrows C.; Lacher S.E.; Macheledt K.C.; Berge J.M.; Ghebre R.G.,"Early-career female faculty, both physician scientists and basic researchers, have disproportionately experienced negative professional, financial, and personal consequences associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This career phase represents a critical time for establishing a network of mentors and collaborators, demonstrating professional independence, and balancing new teaching, research, and service duties while simultaneously navigating personal and familial responsibilities. Persistent gender inequality perpetuated by adherence to traditional gender roles place early-career women faculty at a further disadvantage. Women in academic medicine and research do not attain promotion, leadership positions, and other established markers of success at the same rate as their male counterparts. This disparity was the impetus for the creation of a Recruitment and Retention action group within the Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMN). This perspective piece is written from the viewpoint of a group of female-identifying early-career faculty participating in a career development program for early-stage and newly appointed faculty at UMN, sponsored by the Recruitment and Retention CWIMS action group and our Office of Faculty Affairs. We describe areas of stress exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: work, financial, and work-life well-being, and propose an adapted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) model to guide the response to future challenges within a faculty competency framework.

Disparity in Gender Representation of Speakers at National Emergency Medical Services Conferences: A Current Assessment and Proposed Path Forward,Davic A.; ; Carey E.; Lambert E.; Luckingham T.; Mongiello N.; Peralta R.; Puccio N.; Rivera K.; Torre K.; Maloney L.M.,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparities between Emergency Medicine physicians with regards to salary, promotion, and scholarly recognition as national conference speakers have been well-documented. However, little is known if similar gender disparities impact their out-of-hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) colleagues. Although there have been improvements in the ratio of women entering the EMS workforce, gender representation has improved at a slower rate for paramedics compared to emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Since recruitment, retention, and advancement of females within a specialty have been associated with the visibility of prominent, respected female leaders, gender disparity of these leaders as national conference speakers may contribute to the ""leaky pipeline effect"" seen within the EMS profession. Gender representation of these speakers has yet to be described objectively. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if disparity exists in gender representation of speakers at well-known national EMS conferences and trade shows in the United States (US) from 2016-2020. The secondary objective was to determine if males were more likely than females to return to a conference as a speaker in subsequent years. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A cross-sectional analysis of programs from well-known national conferences, specifically for EMS providers, which were held in the US from 2016-2020 was performed. Programs were abstracted for type of conference session (pre-conference, keynote, main conference) and speakers' names. Speaker gender (male, female) was confirmed via internet search. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Seventeen conference programs were obtained with 1,709 conference sessions that had a total of 2,731 listed speaker names, of whom 537 (20%) were female. A total of 30 keynote addresses had 39 listed speaker names of whom six (15%) were female. No significant difference was observed in the number of years males returned to present at the same conference as compared to females. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Gender representation of speakers at national EMS conferences in the US is not reflective of the current best estimate of the US EMS workforce. This disparity exists not only in the overall percent of female names listed as speakers, but also in the percent of individual female speakers, and is most pronounced within keynote speakers.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of CHB patients who were diagnosed and treated at the outpatient service and ward of Spleen, Stomach, and Hepatobiliary Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine, from November 2014 to June 2018. Related clinical data were collected and recorded, including general information, HBV serological markers, HBV gene mutations, and information obtained by four TCM diagnostic methods. Syndrome differentiation and typing were performed for each patient with reference to the criteria for TCM syndrome differentiation of viral hepatitis, and the association of gene mutation in the pre-C, C, and BCP regions of HBV with TCM syndrome types was analyzed. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for comparison of continuous data between multiple or two groups. Results A total of 235 patients with CHB were enrolled, among whom 101 had internal retention of damp-heat, 88 had stagnation of liver Qi and spleen deficiency, 17 had blood stasis obstructing the collaterals, 19 had liver-kidney Yin deficiency, and 10 had spleen-kidney Yang deficiency. There were significant differences in sex, age, and course of disease between the patients with different TCM syndrome types (chi2=17.389, H=173.280, H=86.520, all P < 0.01), and there was a significant difference in age between the CHB patients with gene mutations in the pre-C, C and BCP regions of HBV (H=30.150, P < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the distribution of TCM syndrome types between the CHB patients with gene mutations in the pre-C, C and BCP regions of HBV (chi2=58.117, P < 0.001), and internal retention of damp-heat and stagnation of liver Qi and spleen deficiency were major TCM syndrome types accounting for 80.43%. The patients with internal retention of damp-heat tended to have A1762T and G1764A mutations, and those with stagnation of liver Qi and spleen deficiency tended to have G1896A, A1762T, and G1764A mutations; G1764A mutation was often observed in the patients with blood stasis obstructing the collaterals or liver-kidney Yin deficiency, and I97L mutation was often observed in the patients with spleen-kidney Yang deficiency. Conclusion Gene mutations in the pre-C, C, and BCP regions of HBV are associated with TCM syndrome types in CHB patients, and internal retention of damp-heat and stagnation of liver Qi and spleen deficiency are the most common TCM syndrome types. I97L mutation is often observed in patients with spleen-kidney Yang deficiency. ,,.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Editorial Board of Jilin University.

The female medical workforce,Critchley J.; ; Schwarz M.; Baruah R.,"In the UK, the proportion of female medical students has remained static over the last decade, at around 55%; however, at consultant level, only 36.6% of doctors are women. The reasons for this drop in numbers are not clear. Given the increase in number of female doctors in training, the proportion of female doctors at consultant level is lower than might be expected. This article discusses issues affecting the female medical workforce in anaesthesia, intensive care and pain medicine. It explores how gender stereotypes and implicit gender bias can affect the way women are perceived in the workplace, especially in leadership positions, and discusses health issues particular to the female medical workforce. While the issues in this article may not affect all women, the cumulative effect of being subject to gender stereotypes within a workplace not designed to accommodate the health needs of women may contribute to a work environment that may promote the attrition of women from our specialties.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Association of Anaesthetists",2021,/,Anaesthesia,76,S4,14EP  - 23,2010707198,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anae.15359,33682097,#876,Critchley 2021,"",""
COVID-19 Threatens Progress Toward Gender Equity Within Academic Medicine,Woitowich N.C.; ; Jain S.; Arora V.M.; Joffe H.,"Women remain underrepresented within academic medicine despite past and present efforts to promote gender equity. The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2021,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,96,6,813EP  - 816,633089642,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003782,33003040,#877,Woitowich 2021,"",""
Moral determinants of health: An overview of disparities in healthcare,Dissanaike S.; ; Matthews J.B.,"Healthcare disparities are a serious problem that shorten the lives of many Americans, even after accounting for social, cultural, and economic factors and correcting for confounders such as the lack of medical insurance and access to healthcare, black Americans and other minority groups receive worse medical care and experience worse outcomes as a result. Healthcare does not occur in a vacuum; surgeons cannot serve our patients' needs isolated in a bubble and cocooned from larger societal concerns. Although disparities rooted in race likely have the greatest negative effects on our patients' health, plenty of groups exist that have not historically received equal opportunities and acceptance within the surgical world. Despite now accounting for more than one half of all medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions, and the gender pay gap has remained significant in all branches of medicine. It will require active, multifaceted, and sustained effort to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery.

As such, the aim of this study was to analyze the experiences of women faculty practicing neurosurgery across Canada to better understand and address the factors contributing to this disparity. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A historical, cross-sectional, and mixed-method analysis of survey responses was performed using survey results obtained from women attending neurosurgeons across Canada. A web-based survey platform was utilized to collect responses. Quantitative analyses were performed on the responses from the study questionnaire, including summary and comparative statistics. Qualitative analyses of free-text responses were performed using axial and open coding. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 19 of 31 respondents (61.3%) completed the survey. Positive enabling factors for career success included supportive colleagues and work environment (52.6%); academic accomplishments, including publications and advanced degrees (36.8%); and advanced fellowship training (47.4%). Perceived barriers reported included inequalities with regard to career advancement opportunities (57.8%), conflicting professional and personal interests (57.8%), and lack of mentorship (36.8%).

Paid Parental Leave Policies Among U.S. News 2020-2021 Best Hospitals and Best Hospitals for Cancer,Lu D.J.; ; King B.L.; Sandler H.M.; Tarbell N.J.; Kamrava M.; Atkins K.M.,"Purpose/Objective(s): The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorses 12-weeks of paid parental leave based on studies showing health benefits to parents and children. Parental leave policies can impact the distribution of child-rearing duties, which may influence gender equity and retention of women in medicine. However, there is a paucity of data describing paid parental leave for faculty/staff physicians. We sought to evaluate paid parental leave policies for physicians at top U.S. hospitals and cancer centers. Materials/Methods: Parental leave policies for the 2020-2021 U.S. News Top 20 Best Hospitals and Best Hospitals for Cancer were reviewed from publicly accessible websites, yielding 27 unique institutions. Human resources offices were contacted to verify policies. Duration of paid child-bearing and parental leave, salary support, and related provisions were obtained. Parental leave included leave available post-childbirth/disability for birthing mothers and for non-birthing mothers, partners, and adoptive parents. Paid leave was defined as receiving >=50% of base salary and excluded regular accrued paid time off (e.g., vacation). If unpaid parental leave was available (< 50% base salary), paid parental leave duration was considered to be zero. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 27 institutions, six (22%) offer longer leave and/or greater pay based on the extent of caregiving responsibility (e.g., primary vs. secondary; n = 2) or employment position (e.g., academic faculty vs. non-faculty staff physician; n = 4). The mean duration of paid leave for birthing mothers (childbirth plus parental leave) is 7.8 weeks (range, 0-14 weeks) and for parental leave is 3.6 weeks (range, 0-12 weeks), using benefits from primary caregiver and academic faculty status where institutional benefits differ. Conversely, using benefits from secondary caregiver or non-faculty status where benefits differ, the mean paid leave for birthing mothers is 6.8 weeks (range, 0-12 weeks) and for parental leave is 2.3 weeks (range, 0-8 weeks). While the majority of hospitals (n = 23, 85%) offer short-term disability for childbirth, pay varies markedly (range, 0%-100%). Four institutions (15%) do not provide paid leave for childbirth and more than half (n = 15, 56%) do not provide paid parental leave beyond childbirth (based on secondary caregiver or non-faculty status where benefits differ). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite AAP endorsement of 12-weeks paid parental leave given improved outcomes for parents and children, the mean duration of paid maternity and parental leave at 27 leading U.S. hospitals and cancer centers is only 7.8 weeks and 3.6 weeks, respectively, at maximal benefits estimates.

Sex differences of brain cholinergic alterations related to the accumulation of oxidative damage due to excess polyunsaturated fatty acids during development,Oliveira S.; ; Zazula M.; Santos W.; Bialli A.; Angelli R.; Naliwaiko K.,"Excess lipids can influence offspring's brain development. Excessive fatty acid supplementation may be able to modulate the protective mechanisms (NP.SH) against oxidative damage, promoting the accumulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and disrupting the activity of cholinesterases (ChE). This study was approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Parana (CEUA 1303/2019) and aimed to evaluate the effect of supplementation with high doses of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and whether there is an influence of sex on development, antioxidant defenses, and activity encephalic cholinergic. Thirty female Wistar rats were divided into 3 experimental groups: control (CTL), supplemented before mating, during pregnancy, and lactation with 4 g/kg of omega 3 (SPL3) or omega 6 (SPL6). After weaning the offspring, the animals were kept without supplementation until the day of euthanasia at 60 days of age. The brains of offspring of both sexes were used to measure the NP.SH, LPO, and ChE activity. Statistical analysis was performed in the R program (version 4.1.0), data were submitted to exploratory statistics through Principal Component Analysis. It was observed that in females, the first component represents the activity of ChE, brain weight, and LPO (variance retention = 51.7%, eigenvalue = 2.07), while in males, the first component represents the activity of ChE, LPO, and NP.SH (variance retention = 39.4%, eigenvalue = 2.13). The offspring supplemented, regardless of sex, showed high values of LPO and ChE (p < 0.0001), while in females there was a reduction in brain weight (p < 0.0001) and in males reduced NP.SH (p < 0.0001). Hence, data confirms that the excessive supplementation of PUFA and its caused metabolic unbalance led to an alteration of LPO and heightened ChE activity that, in its turn, modulated reduction in brain weight in females, not males.

Gender Disparities in Academic Performance in the Sciences,Beaulieu E.; ; Montpetit C.; Cousineau L.,"The gender disparity in numbers of students attending STEM programs has been a challenge since science began. But regardless of this disparity in numbers, differences of gender in academic performances have also been reported, including average GPA, performances during exams and in-class participation. The majority of these performance differences negatively impact women, potentially affecting retention, professional development and professional confidence, further impacting gender equity in the sciences. To analyze whether such disparities exist at the University of Ottawa, we have collated a dataset of the academic performance of all students registered at the University of Ottawa in the Faculty of Science between 2014 and 2019. This includes all students registered in the departments of Biology, Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Earth and Environmental Science, Mathematics and Statistics and Physics, which represent over 4,000 students per year. The students' cumulative GPA was used as a covariate to control for their prior academic ability. Initially, when combining all 122 classes included in this study, analysis of covariance and multi-covariate analysis of variance revealed no gender performance differences. However, when classes were analyzed individually, a gender performance difference was observed in 18 classes (p-value<0.05), and male students were favored in 83.33% of classes with a gender performance difference. The language of study (p-value of 0.001965) and class size (p-value of 0.03598) were factors associated with gender differences in academic performances. Classes which numbered more than 100 students were more likely to be less favourable to women and typically large enrolment 1st and 2nd year classes, regardless of the class subject, represented 14 of the 18 classes with gender differences in academic performances, all of which were more favourable to males than females. No 4th year classes had a gender bias and, curiously, of the only four 3 year classes with a gendered difference in academic performance, 3rd were more favourable to females than to males. Understanding the impact of gender, language and class size on our student population and their influence on academic performance will help us develop actionable measures to improve education outcomes for all our students.

Does amount matter? Analysis of partial standard mealsin nuclear gastric emptying studies,Shah H.; ; Sundar R.; Dong J.; Robertsom M.; Ng T.,"Introduction: Gastric emptying scintigraphy plays a vital role in the evaluation and management of gastricdysmotility, including the assessment for gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting. It is one of the most common nuclearmedicine studies performed. Since gastric emptying dynamics is dependent on several factors, extensive work hasbeen done to standardize acquisition parameters of this exam. In particular, a recommended standardized meal hasbeen established in the United States, consisting of 2 slices of toasted white bread, 30g of jelly,118ml of liquid eggwhite and 120mL of water (1). Previously, a multicenter investigation established a range of normal reference valuesfor gastric emptying using the complete standard meal in adults. However, in the clinical setting, it is not infrequentthat the patient is unable to eat the complete meal. We previously showed that the partial ingestion of the standardmeal can be assessed in with the adult criteria in the pediatric population (2). To date, no clinical guidance is inplace to guide interpretation of such studies in the adults. The purpose of this study is thus to determine the performance of gastric emptying retention values defined using the complete standard meal for use with partially ingested standard meals in the adult population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This IRB-exempt retrospective study analyzed adult (18 years and above) gastric emptying studies performed (n = 681) in the nuclear medicine department of a large academic medical center. The standard gastric emptying scintigraphy protocol was performed for all patients, with gastric retention values calculated at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (as necessary) based on acquired images for all performed studies. Patients were identified to have normal or delayed gastric emptying based on the adult criterion of <=10% emptying by 4 hours. Within these cohorts, the gastric retention values at all time points were compared between patients ingesting the complete standard meal and partial standard meals, segregated into 4 cohorts (<50% and >=50% or <75% and >=75% ingestion of the complete standard meal). Variations in gastric emptying due to differences in age ranges and sex were also assessed. The Kruskal- Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were performed for multiple comparisons where appropriate and p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 681 total patients, 419 subjects ate the complete standard meal (n = 318 with normal emptying and n = 101 delayed emptying). 262 subjects ate partial meals (n = 183 normal emptying and n = 79 delayed emptying). The gastric retention values for normal and delayed cohorts across different meal types are shown in Figure 1. .For normal subjects, there were significant differences in gastric retention at 1 and 2 h post ingestion between the complete meals and ingestion of <75% of the complete meal, but these values remained well above the 10% threshold criteria. No significant differences were noted at other time points. No significant differences in gastric retention values were noted across all meal types and time points were noted for delayed subjects. These findings were not significantly different across multiple age ranges and between sexes. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results suggest that the standard adult criteria for gastric emptying scintigraphy can be applied for partially ingested standard meals up to 75% of the complete meal. Further studies will be performed to ascertain this finding at multiple institutions and across patient subsets.

Age, relationship status, and financial cost were cited as top factors that influenced whether or not to pursue fertility preservation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews elucidated fertility and family building concerns among women in medicine and were used to develop a tailored survey for women in medicine. Preliminary results demonstrate women may delay childbearing due to medical training and make significant accommodations in their careers to support family building. Impact Statement: Persistent gender disparities exist in leadership and faculty ranks in academic medicine despite equal matriculation into medical school.

Mentoring as an intervention to promote gender equality in academic medicine: A systematic review,House A.; ; Dracup N.; Burkinshaw P.; Ward V.; Bryant L.D.,"Background Mentoring is frequently suggested as an intervention to address gender inequalities in the workplace. Objectives To systematically review evidence published since a definitive review in 2006 on the effectiveness of mentoring interventions aimed at achieving gender equality in academic medicine. Design Systematic Review, using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication as a template for data extraction and synthesis. Sample Studies were included if they described a specific mentoring intervention in a medical school or analogous academic healthcare organisation and included results from an evaluation of the intervention. Eligibility criteria Mentoring was defined as (1) a formally organised intervention entailing a supportive relationship between a mentor, defined as a more senior/experienced person and a mentee defined as a more junior/inexperienced person; (2) mentoring intervention involved academic career support (3) the mentoring relationship was outside line management or supervision of performance and was defined by contact over an extended period of time. Outcomes The impact of mentoring was usually reported at the level of individual participants, for example, satisfaction and well-being or self-reported career progression. We sought evidence of impact on gender equality via reports of organisation-level effectiveness, of promotion or retention, pay and academic performance of female staff. Results We identified 32 publications: 8 review articles, 20 primary observational studies and 4 randomised controlled trials. A further 19 discussed mentoring in relation to gender but did not meet our eligibility criteria. The terminology used, and the structures and processes reported as constituting mentoring, varied greatly. We identified that mentoring is popular with many who receive it; however, we found no robust evidence of effectiveness in reducing gender inequalities. Primary research used weak evaluation designs. Conclusions Mentoring is a complex intervention. Future evaluations should adopt standardised approaches used in applied health research to the design and evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Gender equity climate in an academic emergency medicine department,Thomas M.A.; ; Nazir N.; Barth B.E.,"Background and Objectives: Equity disparities in gender and other protected classes are increasingly recognized as a source of stress and dissatisfaction with work. These stressors can have negative impacts on promotion and retention of faculty. We sought to quantify and describe perceived gender disparities within an academic emergency medicine department. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a mixed methods survey. The questions were from previously validated studies and minimally adapted to our target audience. All EM faculty received the anonymous survey. We performed a bivariate analysis with gender the dependent variable. Due to small sample size, we used the non-parametric Fisher's exact test for p-values. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 100% of full-time faculty and 1 part-time faculty completed the survey (n = 25). 7 women and 17 men responded to the survey (1 person did not disclose gender). Comparing women to men, 28.6% vs. 76.0% report their opportunities at work were the same as peers (p = 0.0356), 28.6% vs. 88.0% report their opinions and ideas are valued (p = 0.0106), 85.7% vs. 13.0% felt discriminated against based on gender (p = 0.0005), 0.0% vs. 75.0% felt all genders are respected equally in our department (p = 0.0013), 57.1% vs. 6.3% report someone has taken credit for their work (p = 0.0173), 0.0% vs 43.8% report the department has been working actively with gender equity (p = 0.0209), 57.1% vs. 0.0% have been subjected to offensive remarks related to gender at work (p = 0.004).

Academic Workforce Diversity Trends by Sex and Underrepresented in Medicine Status Among US Radiation Oncology & Medical Oncology Faculty Over Five Decades,Kamran S.C.; ; Niemierko A.; Vapiwala N.,"Purpose/Objective(s): A healthcare workforce that better reflects the demographics of those it serves can lead to improved patient trust, compliance and outcomes. It is unclear if the growing imperative to address disparities in racial/ethnic and gender representation in the medical field has resulted in corresponding progress in the composition of academic radiation and medical oncology (RO, MO) departments. Herein we report trends in RO and MO faculty diversity, overall and by academic rank, over the past 5 decades. Materials/Methods: Data were acquired from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster between 1970 and 2019 for academic RO and MO departments to determine sex and race/ethnicity trends over five decades. Underrepresented in Medicine (URM) was defined as individuals identifying as Black, Hispanic, and Native American. Linear regression models were used to estimate slopes and associated P-values. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Total faculty complements grew over time in both RO and MO. The number of URM female faculty increased by 0.85/year in RO and 0.79/year in MO (P-trend < 0.001), compared to non-URM female faculty, which increased by 11.3/year in RO and 7.9 in MO (P-trend < 0.001). URM male faculty increased by 1.4/year in RO and 1.1/year in MO (P-trend < 0.001), compared to non-URM male faculty, which increased by 25.5/year for RO and 12.2/year for MO (P-trend < 0.001). Males represented the majority of URM and non-URM faculty for both RO and MO. The proportion of females grew more than that of URM faculty over the study period for both RO and MO. There were also significant differences in diversity by faculty rank. Female faculty members had a lower academic rank than their male counterparts in both specialties. At every rank, the number of URM faculty represented among both MO and RO was low (Table). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender and racial/ethnic diversity of academic RO and MO faculty has increased over time but has not kept pace with that of the US population, particularly with respect to URM status. The proportion of female faculty in both specialties demonstrates more promising growth, and may inform measures to achieve similar progress in recruiting and retaining URM faculty in MO and RO.

GENDER DISPARITIES NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO MENTORING FOR WOMEN GASTROENTEROLOGISTS AND TRAINEES,Rabinowitz L.; ; Grinspan L.T.; Zylberberg H.M.; Dixon R.E.; David Y.N.; Kumta N.A.; Kim M.K.; Greenwald D.A.,"Purpose: Women remain in the minority in gastroenterology, where only 18% of the field is female. As more women enter the field, addressing barriers to effective mentoring will be imperative in order to foster the next generation of leaders and mitigate attrition in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We distributed a web-based survey to 796 women and male gastroenterology fellows and faculty at 20 academic institutions geographically distributed across the United States. We used chi-square and Fisher exact tests to compare responses of women and male gastroenterology faculty and trainees. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 334 physicians responded to the survey, for a response rate of 42%. 299 physicians (129 women and 170 men) completed >70% of questions and were included in analysis. Fewer women reported their career was prioritized over a spouse's (23.6% of women v. 45.5% of men; p<0.001), despite no differences in perceived importance of career versus non-professional goals (p=0.17) and likelihood of achieving full professor rank (p= 0.17). More women preferred to have a mentor of the same gender (38.6% v. 4.2%, p <0.001) and race/ethnicity (13.4% v. 3.6%, p<0.001) (Figure 1). However, fewer women reported actually having a primary mentor of the same gender (45.5% v. 70.2%, p<0.001). Women at all training levels reported more difficulty finding a mentor when compared to male colleagues (44.4% v. 16.0%, p<0.001), and to cite inability to identify a similar-gender mentor as a factor that interfered with access to mentorship (12.8% v. 0.9%, p<0.001). Women were more likely to report that mentors rarely gave advice relating to career advancement (14.3% v. 3.9%, p=0.02). Women were less likely to report that a mentor facilitated their participation in journal editorial boards (p<0.001), chairing of conferences (p=0.001), and research collaboration (p=0.03) (Figure 2). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Barriers to obtaining effective mentorship may have significant implications on current and future generations of gastroenterologists' ability to achieve academic success and leadership positions.

An assessment of various factors in patients who underwent full mouth rehabilitation in a university hospital set up,Ilankizhai R.J.; ; Duraisamy R.; Madhu Laxmi M.,"The best treatment option available for treating any generalised tooth structure loss is to undergo full mouth rehabilitation. Full mouth rehabilitation aims at restoration of form and function of masticatory apparatus to nearly as normal condition as possible. The aim of the study was to report on the gender distribution and most common cause for full mouth rehabilitation among patients with FMR in a private dental college over six months of period. A retrospective study was done using the case records of patients visiting University hospital from June 2019-March 2020. Case sheets with information on full mouth rehabilitation were retrieved and analysed using SPSS 20.0 software. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed. The results reported that there were no particular differences in gender distribution. Both females and males had equal predilection(50 %-males, 50 % Females).Majority of the males who are diagnosed with FMR were in the age group 59 to 68 years whereas females diagnosed with FMR were in the age group 49 to 58 years which was found to be statistically significant as determined by chi-square tests(p value< 0.05).The most common reason in males for full mouth rehabilitation was attrition whereas in females multiple missing teeth, however, there was no significant association between the genders and cause of full mouth rehabilitation as determined by Pearson's chi-square test (p value> 0.05). Within the limits of the study, it can be concluded that Full mouth rehabilitation was done in both genders equally and females underwent FMR at a much younger age than males.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, J.

Panelists included 21 women of varied age, ethnicity, education, and urban/rural residence; and 21 health professionals with PCC or women's health expertise. Panelists rated recommendations, derived from prior research and organized by a 6-domain PCC framework, on a 7-point Likert scale in an online survey. We used summary statistics to report response frequencies and defined consensus as when >=85% panelists chose 5 to 7. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The response rate was 100%.

Recruitment in Surgery and Interventional Radiology: Factors in Female Trainees' Specialty Decisions,Matsumoto M.M.; ; Schultz O.; Jiang T.; Navuluri R.,"Objective: This study aims to identify factors influencing female medical students' decision-making about specialties, specifically surgery and interventional radiology (IR), in an effort to inform future recruitment and professional development strategies. <ovid:br/>Design(s): An electronic survey was created to assess both qualitative and quantitative data. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): The survey was sent prior to a symposium for trainees interested in pursuing IR or surgery, held at University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) in February 2019. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): The 90 female trainees who registered were sent the survey, and 48 (53%) responded voluntarily. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All respondents were female, 46% planned to pursue surgery or IR. Students pursuing surgery/IR were less concerned about being valued by their colleagues (p = 0.0073), being in charge of patients' lives (p = 0.0017), radiation exposure (p = 0.0171), chemical exposure (p = 0.0223), emotional stress (p = 0.0244), or shift work (p = 0.0045), compared to the nonsurgery/IR students. No differences were found in ranking of motivating factors, personal strengths or weaknesses, deciding factors, areas for seeking mentorship, or gender diversity. Top motivations among all respondents were intellectual rigor of medicine and becoming a mentor, while concerns were personal physical health, managing a career, pay equity, and gender-based biases. Students most often sought mentors and clerkship experience for making specialty decisions. They reported greatest strengths in empathy and resilience, and weaknesses in negotiating and public speaking. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female medical students planning to pursue surgery/IR expressed greater confidence in their contributions to patient care and lower concerns about workplace hazards. Regardless of specialty intent, female students shared scholarship motivations for a career in medicine, valued the role of mentorship, and expressed persistent concerns about gender discrimination, personal health, and skills-based weaknesses.

Women Surgeons' Experiences of Interprofessional Workplace Conflict,Dossett L.A.; ; Vitous C.A.; Lindquist K.; Jagsi R.; Telem D.A.,"Importance: Gender differences in interprofessional conflict may exist and precipitate differential achievement, wellness, and attrition in medicine. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Although substantial attention and research has been directed toward improving gender equity in surgery and addressing overall physician wellness, research on the role of interprofessional conflict has been limited. The objective of this study was to understand scenarios driving interprofessional conflict involving women surgeons, the implications of the conflict on personal, professional, and patient outcomes, and how women surgeons navigate conflict adjudication. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A qualitative approach was used to explore the nature, implications, and ways of navigating interprofessional workplace conflict experienced by women surgeons. The setting was a national sample of US women surgeons. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit women surgeons in training or practice from annual surgical society meetings. Participants were eligible if they were currently in a surgical training program or surgical practice. Nearly all participants had experienced at least 1 workplace conflict with a nonphysician staff member resulting in a formal write-up. Exposures: A workplace conflict was defined as any conflict resulting in the nonphysician staff member taking action such as confronting the woman surgeon, reporting the event to supervisors, or filing a formal report. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Interviews were conducted between February 19, 2019, and June 21, 2019. Recordings were transcribed and deidentified. Inductive thematic analysis was used to examine data in relation to the research questions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty US women surgeons (8 [27%] age 25-34 years, 16 [53%] age 35-44 years, 5 [17%] age 45-54 years, and 1 [3%] age 55-64 years) of varying surgical specialties were interviewed. Conflicts were often reported as due to a breakdown in communication or from performance-related disputes. Participants perceived personal and professional implications including self-doubt, depression, frustration, anxiety, loss of sleep, reputational harms, and delays to advancement. Participants also described potential patient safety implications primarily due to decreased communication resulting from some surgeons being hesitant to engage in subsequent interactions. Participants described a variety of navigation strategies including relationship management, rapport building, and social capital. The success of these processes tended to vary by individual circumstances, including the details of the conflict, practice setting, level of support of leadership, and individual personality of the surgeon. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study highlights women surgeons' experiences with interprofessional workplace conflict. Interprofessional culture building, broader dissemination of implicit bias training, and transparent and equitable adjudication systems are potential strategies for avoiding or mitigating the implications of these conflicts.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

Long-term biological variation estimates of 13 hematological parameters in healthy Chinese subjects,Li C.; ; Peng M.; Wu J.; Du Z.; Lu H.; Zhou W.,"The complete blood count (CBC) is a basic test routinely ordered by physicians as a part of initial diagnostic work-up on their patients. To ensure safe clinical application of the CBC, reliable biological variation (BV) data are needed to establish analytical performance specifications. Our aim was to define the BV of CBC parameters using a rigorous protocol that is compliant with the Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC) provided by the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. Blood samples drawn from 41 healthy Chinese subjects (22 females and 19 males; 23-59 years of age) once monthly for 6 consecutive months were analyzed using an ABX Pentra 80 instrument. The instrument was precisely calibrated. All samples were analyzed in duplicate for 13 CBC parameters. The data were assessed for outliers, normality, and variance homogeneity prior to nested ANOVA. Gender-stratified within-subject (CVI) and between-subject (CVG) BV estimates were calculated. The number of remaining data for each subject was 442-484 after removing outliers. No significant differences existed between female/male CVI estimates. Except for leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, the mean values of 10 parameters differed significantly between genders, rendering partitioning of CVG data between genders. No significant differences were detected between most BV estimates and recently published estimates representing a Europid population. Most BV estimates in BIVAC-compliant studies are similar. The turnover time of blood cells and age distribution of participants should be considered in a CBC BV study.

Inequity and Women Physicians: Time to Change Millennia of Societal Beliefs,Newman C.; ; Templeton K.; Chin E.L.,"Gender inequities date back thousands of years, with women expected to be caregivers at home and men expected to be leaders with occupations outside the home. In more recent history, women have trained in various professions, including medicine. Although the number of female physicians has risen consistently over the past several decades and half of US medical students now are women, gender inequities persist and are due, at least in part, to implicit (unconscious) biases held by doctors, other health care professionals, and patients and their families. Implicit biases negatively affect women in their medical careers and contribute to slower advancement, less favorable evaluations, underrepresentation in leadership positions, fewer invited lectures, lower salaries, impostor syndrome, and burnout. Despite efforts to address gender biases, studies in academic medical centers indicate no major change over a 20-year span. Management of implicit gender bias at the organizational level is imperative. Strategies include implicit bias training for doctors and other staff; development of a transparent and equitable compensation plan; and transparent processes for promotion and hiring, mentorship, and sponsorship of women physicians for grand rounds, lectureships, committees, leadership positions, and awards. Achievement of equity for women physicians requires effort and ultimately a culture change. Gender equity in the medical profession will lead to improved physician wellness, retention of women physicians, and improved access to and quality of health care.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Permanente Press.

Evaluating the Role of Self-Esteem on Differential Career Outcomes by Gender in Academic Medicine,Manne-Goehler J.; ; Freund K.M.; Raj A.; Kaplan S.E.; Terrin N.; Breeze J.L.; Carr P.L.,"PURPOSE: Gender differences in faculty advancement persist in academic medicine. Understanding of what drives these differences remains limited. The relationship among self-esteem, gender, and career outcomes has not previously been explored. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The authors evaluated the association between gender and 2012-2013 career outcomes, specifically, the number of publications, academic rank, leadership positions, and retention, and whether self-esteem as measured in the 1995 National Faculty Survey mediates this relationship. They measured self-esteem using the modified Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The authors used multivariable logistic regression analysis to understand the association among gender, self-esteem, and the outcomes of rank, leadership, and retention, and negative binomial models for number of publications. Models were adjusted for race, specialty, effort distribution, and years since first faculty appointment. The authors performed a mediation analysis to understand whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between gender and these career outcomes. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Overall, self-esteem scores were high. Women had lower self-esteem in 1995 than their male colleagues. In adjusted models, female gender was associated with lower performance on all 4 career outcome metrics. While self-esteem scores were positively associated with all 4 outcomes, the authors' mediation analysis suggested that self-esteem did not mediate the relationship between gender and these 4 career metrics. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Female medical faculty members lag behind men on traditional metrics of faculty achievement. While higher self-esteem is positively associated with faculty achievement, it did not mediate the relationship between gender and career advancement over the 17 years of follow-up and, thus, may not be an ideal target for programs and policies to increase gender parity in academic medicine.",2020,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,95,10,1558EP  - 1562,630427258,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003138,31876564,#902,Manne-Goehler 2020,"",""
Correlates of psychopathic personality traits in a sample of college students in Tunisia,Fekih-Romdhane F.; ; Ben Hamouda A.; Halayem S.; BelHadj A.; Cheour M.,"Background: Although psychopathy and its predictive factors are well documented in clinical samples, studies in non-clinical populations are relatively rare.

Specifically, research in politics has shown that term limits have had a minimal effect on the number of women and minorities elected to office, while research in business indicates term limits do increase innovation. Additionally, term limits may have unintended negative consequences, including inhibiting individuals from developing deep expertise in a specific area of interest and destabilizing institutions that endure frequent turnover in leaders. Given this conflicting information, it is not surprising that academic medical centers (AMCs) in the United States have not widely incorporated term limits for those holding positions of power, including deans, presidents, provosts, and department heads. Notably, a few AMCs have incorporated such limits for some positions, and faculty have viewed these positively for their ability to shape a more egalitarian and collaborative culture. Drawing on studies from academic medicine, politics, and business, the author examines arguments both for and against instituting term limits at AMCs. The author concludes that despite strong arguments against term limits, they deserve attention in academic medicine, especially given their potential to help address gender and racial disparities and to encourage innovation.",2020,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,95,2,180EP  - 183,629513053,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003020,31577584,#904,Austin 2020,"",""
Leveraging resources through the translational research institute to engage communities in tobacco-related health disparities research,Davis A.H.; ; Cottoms N.; Hale R.; Donald K.; Hsu P.C.; Kulik M.; Bryant-Moore K.; Su J.; Spencer N.; Ruffin C.; Ivy Y.; Fagan P.,"Purpose: Cigarette smoking-attributable cancer mortality is highest among African Americans, who are disproportionately exposed to smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS). In 2016, 13.5% of African American women in the United States smoked compared to 19.8% of African American women in Arkansas. Comprehensive smokefree policies in the home play a critical role in reducing tobacco exposures and increasing quitting, but policy implementation is often a challenge. This study describes the collaborative process used to engage community in providing feedback on study methods for a randomized trial designed to increase the implementation of smoke-free policies in the homes of African American women smokers who live in rural distressed counties in the Arkansas Delta. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Four Community Review Boards (CRB) (n=38) were conducted in collaboration with the Translational Research Institute (TRI) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. CRBs are expert community panels who provide feedback on research studies. Our study team worked with TRI's Community Engagement (CE) Core and the CE and Dissemination Core of the Arkansas Center for Health Disparities to recruit African American women smokers aged 18-50 years to obtain input on our study methods. CRBs were co-facilitated by staff from April to June 2018 in rural AR counties. Staff obtained feedback on the collection of biologic samples; surveys; recruitment and retention; use of the tobacco Quitline; incentives; project name and logo; and volunteer boarddevelopment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): CRB I experts felt comfortable with research staff collecting saliva samples from children in the home, butexpressed concerns about providing blood or urine samples. Some experts preferred paper, while others preferredshort computer-based surveys. None of the experts was interested in using the tobacco Quitline. CRB II expertsexpressed the need for community development activities (e.g., spa day, support groups) and monetary andnonmonetary incentives such as the nicotine patch. Experts emphasized the need to engage community women inrecruitment efforts due to distrust of outsiders. CRB III experts suggested that we incentivize a volunteer board toassist with recruitment. Experts in CRB III and IV selected recruitment messages and delivery channels (e.g., flyers,word of mouth, Facebook). Experts prioritized recruitment activities brainstormed in CRB II, described how toorganize the activities, and selected incentives (e.g., Walmart and Dollar General gift cards) and promotional items(e.g., tee-shirts). Experts in CRB IV identified a project name and logo (Families Rising to Enforce SmokefreeHomes). An unintended consequence was that women participated in the CRBs because they wanted to quitsmoking. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CRBs are often a one-time event conducted by researchers seeking expert community opinions.

Markers of achievement for assessing and monitoring gender equity in a UK National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre: A two-factor model,Henderson L.R.; ; Shah S.G.S.; Ovseiko P.V.; Dam R.; Buchan A.M.; McShane H.; Kiparoglou V.,"Background The underrepresentation of women in academic medicine at senior level and in leadership positions is well documented. Biomedical Research Centres (BRC), partnerships between leading National Health Service (NHS) organisations and universities, conduct world class translational research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK. Since 2011 BRCs are required to demonstrate significant progress in gender equity (GE) to be eligible to apply for funding. However, the evidence base for monitoring GE specifically in BRC settings is underdeveloped. This is the first survey tool designed to rank and identify new GE markers specific to the NIHR BRCs. Methods An online survey distributed to senior leadership, clinical and non-clinical researchers, trainees, administrative and other professionals affiliated to the NIHR Oxford BRC (N = 683). Participants ranked 13 markers of GE on a five point Likert scale by importance. Data were summarised using frequencies and descriptive statistics. Interrelationships between markers and underlying latent dimensions (factors) were determined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results The response rate was 36% (243 respondents). Respondents were more frequently female (55%, n = 133), aged 41-50 years (33%, n = 81), investigators (33%, n = 81) affiliated to the BRC for 2-7 years (39.5%, n = 96). Overall participants ranked 'BRC senior leadership roles' and 'organisational policies on gender equity', to be the most important markers of GE. 58% (n = 141) and 57% (n = 139) respectively. Female participants ranked 'organisational policies' (64.7%, n = 86/133) and 'recruitment and retention' (60.9%, n = 81/ 133) most highly, whereas male participants ranked 'leadership development' (52.1%, n = 50/96) and 'BRC senior leadership roles' (50%, n = 48/96) as most important. Factor analyses identified two distinct latent dimensions: ""organisational markers""and ""individual markers""of GE in BRCs. Conclusions A two-factor model of markers of achievement for GE with ""organisational""and ""individual""dimensions was identified. Implementation and sustainability of gender equity requires commitment at senior leadership and organisational policy level.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Henderson et al.

Women in Orthopaedics: How Understanding Implicit Bias Can Help Your Practice,Mulcahey M.K.; ; Van Heest A.E.; Weber K.,"Women comprise approximately 50% of medical students; however, only 14% of current orthopaedic residents are women. There are many factors that contribute to the reluctance of female medical students to enter the field including limited exposure to musculoskeletal medicine during medical school, negative perception of the field, lack of female mentors, barriers to promotion, and acceptance by senior faculty. Diversity in orthopaedics is critical to provide culturally competent care. Two pipeline programs, the Perry Initiative and Nth Dimensions, have successful track records in increasing female and underrepresented minorities in orthopaedic surgery residency training. Recognizing and combating implicit bias in orthopaedics will improve recruitment, retention, promotion, and compensation of female orthopaedic surgeons. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the current status of women in orthopaedics, describe ways to improve diversity in the field, and make surgeons aware of how implicit bias can contribute to discrepancies seen in orthopaedic surgery, including pay scale inequities and women in leadership positions.",2020,/,Instructional course lectures,69,,245EP  - 254,637589740,,32017731,#909,Mulcahey 2020,"",""
Gender Trends of Military and Civilian General Surgery Residency Applicants,Campbell K.; ; Weiss J.; Lammers D.; Marenco C.; DeBarros M.D.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that women comprise half of medical school graduates, women remain under-represented in General Surgery, with a higher attrition rate compared with men. There are ongoing efforts to close the gender gap in the civilian sector, but it is unknown how military medicine compares. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A retrospective review of the Electronic Residency Application Service and Medical Operational Data System applicants from 2014-2018 was performed. Demographic data included age, sex, marital status, board scores, applied and matched specialty. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 5,447 applicants who matched into civilian General Surgery programs, and 107 applicants matched into Army General Surgery programs from 2014-2018. Among matched civilian applicants, 39% were female, while 61% were males, and the percentage of applicants who matched into General Surgery was higher in males as compared with females (13.5% vs 9.3%, p=0.0001). Among matched Army applicants, 44% were female and 56% were males. There was a trend toward an increased percentage of females each consecutive year. The percentage matching into General Surgery was statistically higher in females compared with males (12.8% vs 9.1%, p=0.044), with females matching at a statistically higher rate (75% vs 57%, p=0.021). Males had statistically significant higher Step 1 and 2 scores. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): There is a lack of female representation in surgical residencies, fellowships, and academic appointments.

Challenges to successful research careers in neurology: How gender differences may play a role,Minen M.T.; ; Law E.F.; Harriott A.; Seng E.K.; Hranilovich J.; Szperka C.L.; Wells R.E.,"There has been a substantial rise in the number of women pursuing careers in neurology. However, research has shown that women in neurology have high rates of burnout with gender disparities in burnout and attrition in the field. Recently, there was a call from the NIH, including the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, asking for input on factors that may limit or discourage grant applications from women. As the recipients of the highly coveted NIH career mentored awards (K awards) in headache medicine, we applaud the NIH for asking for gender-specific feedback and for raising awareness of research showing that female faculty on the Research Track are at an increased risk of departure. Using the NIH model for the Responsible Conduct of Research and the tenant of Nurturing the Fertile Environment, we discuss specific challenges in academic research that may contribute to gender differences in neurology research success. Although the rate of women conducting NIH-funded migraine research increased from 23% to 41% over the last 10 years, more women are currently in training compared with independence, with 6/6 of the NIH training grants but only 12/36 of the NIH research-level grants, held by women in fiscal years 2017-2019.

Gender homophily in translational collaborations; a network analysis study of investigators at one academic medical center,Nooraie R.Y.; ; Wayman E.; Dozier A.,"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Collaborations are at the core of translational science and team science. Differences by gender have been identified in various research contexts from recruitment to retention to promotion. This study assesses the relational associations of translational collaborations, and what role of gender. METHODS/ STUDY POPULATION: In 2011 and 2013, clinical and basic sciences investigators at University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry responded to an online survey nominating their research collaborators. Two study years were merged, and name lists were transformed into a collaboration network. Departments were classified into basic sciences (e.g. biochemistry) and clinical (e.g. urology). If respondent and partner were affiliated to different department classes, the collaboration was defined as translational. Multi-level GLM models were developed to assess the associates of the likelihood of translational vs. within discipline collaborations. Partner nominations were nested in respondents. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 202 respondents were included in the multi-level GLM models. A collaboration was more likely to be translational if the respondent shared more collaborators with the partner (OR:1.13), and respondent was a central actor in collaboration network (OR: 1.2). Translational collaborations were less likely to be reported by clinicians (OR: 0.25). In the model to assess gender match, a collaboration was more likely to be translational if the respondent was male, and nominated a male partner. For both genders, collaboration with a partner of the opposite gender was more likely to be translational if respondent had more shared collaborators with the partner. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Translational collaborations happen in teams. Gender homophily exits in translational collaborations, and is reduced by shared collaborators; implying the effect of personal connections and community membership. Community-building interventions may increase diversity in translational collaborations.",2020,/,Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,4,Supplement 1,118,643530620,,,#914,Nooraie 2020,"",""
Retention of women in academic medicine and effects of mentorship,Onumah C.; ; Cioletti A.; Wikstrom S.,"BACKGROUND: Despite entering medical school and academic medicine at higher rates, rates of women faculty are not commensurate with men. Literature has shown that women leave or intend to leave academic medicine for multiple reasons. Gender leadership gaps in academic medicine are well documented in the literature more-so than gender gaps in retention. Lack of women in leadership roles equates to lack of female role models and potential losses related to organizational effectiveness given the importance of diversity within teams and organizations. To address the gender gaps in leadership in academic medicine, we must address the leaky pipeline. The goal of the study is to provide descriptive information regarding relationships between specific institutional factors and interventions and women's intent to remain in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): To better identify what factors are associated with women's retention or intent to remain in academic medicine, we surveyed women faculty with appointments in U.S. Departments of Medicine. The survey consisted of a series of questions rated on a Likert scale, demographic questions, and qualitative write- in questions derived from the literature. Participants voluntarily completed the survey by links posted on public listservs. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), descriptive and discriminant analyses were performed. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): At the close of the survey, 429 survey responses analyzed after removing incomplete surveys and respondents that that did not meet inclusion criteria. The sample included women faculty across all ranks, across all regions, and various ethnicities. The largest number of responses were from women in general internal medicine. Of the participants, 43% were satisfied with the current level of mentorship provided at their institution. More participants agreed if there was a formal mentorship program at their institution, but rates were lower if it was through an outside program or formal peer mentorship. Institutional interventions to address gender inequities varied. A number of factors were found to have a positive association with intention to remain in academic medicine including opportunities to integrate work and life identities, flexible work options, paid parental leave, and professional development. Over 80% of women responding plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While gender bias training for leaders and committee members and faculty development programs may be important steps in addressing gender inequities in academic medicine, these initiatives alone are unlikely to fix the leaky pipeline. Despite the lower rates of women climbing the leadership ladder, most are satisfied with their current opportunities of formal mentorship and plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years.

An investigation into the causes of gender disparity in STEM academia and the associated impacts upon education,Linehan K.; ; Boynton L.,"The topic of gender disparity in academic positions within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in higher education is under current public debate. However, the impact of such gender imbalance upon teaching practice and student engagement is seldom acknowledged. The aim of this research was to uncover the effects of the paucity of females in high tenure roles upon students in the Faculty of Science (FoS) at the University of Sheffield (UoS). It is hoped that the results of this research shall aid policy makers within the Department of Anatomy and university-wide to implement changes in pedagogical methods. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) leads for 5 departments (Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Molecular Biology and Animal and Plant Sciences) within the FoS at UoS. The interviews were then transcribed and coded. Ethical approval was obtained from the University Ethics Committee at Sheffield. 4 causes of staff gender imbalance were identified in 100% (n=5) of the departments interviewed: 1) Raising a family 2) Lack of female role models 3) Recruitment processes 4) Cultural pressures. 60% (n=3) of departments were driving initiatives to improve gender equality; 80% (n=4) of EDI leads stated a lack of female staff negatively impacts female students in terms of career progression and 40% (n=2) of departments had made changes to their curriculums to improve gender equality. From this research, and associated literature review, it can be concluded that the gender and associated behaviours of a teacher can not only affect the retainment of students in HE, but also their confidence in ability and overall well-being whilst studying at university. Although limited by number of participants, this research provides an important insight into individual departments at the UoS which can be used university and nationwide to improve the delivery and overall quality of education.",2020,/,Journal of Anatomy,236,Supplement 1,225EP  - 226,631725889,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joa.13163,,#916,Linehan 2020,"",""

Gender equity: how do the forensic sciences fare?,Ward J.; ; Johnson R.N.; Wilson-Wilde L.,"Females are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at all levels of society. Fewer females are completing STEM school subjects, graduating with STEM degrees, being employed as STEM professionals, and holding senior leadership and academic positions in STEM. However, unlike almost every other STEM discipline, the overall ratio of females is higher in many forensic science disciplines. For our sector, rather than having difficulty in attracting females, the bigger issue is how we retain and promote female talent. This complex issue is exacerbated by: gender pay gaps; family role expectations; lack of visible role models or mentors; discrimination and harassment; and bias during recruitment and promotion practices. We discuss barriers relevant for women in the forensic industry and offer potential solutions. These include flexible work arrangements, sponsorship programmes, and fostering and practising an inclusive workplace culture. Gender equity programmes and exemplar STEM organizations focused on a commitment to gender parity will be explored.

Assessment of gender-based linguistic differences in physician trainee evaluations of medical faculty using automated text mining,Heath J.K.; ; Weissman G.E.; Clancy C.B.; Shou H.; Farrar J.T.; Dine C.J.,"IMPORTANCE Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender. OBJECTIVE To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1- and 2-word phrases. Mixedeffects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation. RESULTS A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]). The individual words art (odds ratio [OR], 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.89), trials (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.34-14.69), master (OR, 4.24; 95%CI, 1.69-10.63), and humor (OR, 2.32; 95%CI, 1.44-3.73) were significantly associated with evaluations of male faculty, whereas the words empathetic (OR, 4.34; 95%CI, 1.56-12.07), delight (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.35-13.40), and warm (OR, 3.45; 95%CI, 1.83-6.49) were significantly associated with evaluations of female faculty. Two-word phrases associated with male faculty evaluations included run rounds (OR, 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.84), big picture (OR, 7.15; 95%CI, 1.68-30.42), and master clinician (OR, 4.02; 95%CI, 1.21-13.36), whereas evaluations of female faculty were more likely to be associated with model physician (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.70-35.39), just right (OR, 6.97; 95%CI, 1.51-32.30), and attention (to) detail (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.36-13.40). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The data showed quantifiable linguistic differences between free-text comments about male and female faculty in physician trainee evaluations.

Barriers Pushed Aside: Insights on Career and Family Success from Women Leaders in Academic Otolaryngology,Meyer T.K.; ; Bergmark R.; Zatz M.; Sardesai M.G.; Litvack J.R.; Starks Acosta A.,"Objective: Although the literature adequately identifies the current gender inequality that exists in academic otolaryngology and describes the barriers to advancement of women in academic medicine, there is little information regarding the daily details of how successful women in academic otolaryngology achieve work-life balance. This study was designed to better understand how women in academic otolaryngology achieve work-life balance while negotiating family and childrearing commitments, clinical workload, and scholarly activity, as well as to highlight coping strategies and behaviors that women have used to achieve these successes. <ovid:br/>Study Design: Qualitative research design. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirteen successful women in academic otolaryngology with children were recruited using a networking/snowball sampling methodology to participate in a semistructured qualitative interview about the daily process of work-life balance in an academic otolaryngology practice. A focus group of 7 additional participants was held to validate critical topics/themes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Four broad categories of findings emerged from the study: (1) participants' strong commitment to academic medicine, (2) the fluid/elusive nature of work-life balance, (3) specific approaches to successfully managing home life, and (4) insights related to achieving psychoemotional health. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The conflicting demands between home and professional life are one of the barriers to recruiting, promoting, and retaining women in academic otolaryngology.

Patient perspectives on inferior vena cava filter retrieval,Aurshina A.; ; Brahmandam A.; Zhang Y.; Yang Y.; Mojibian H.; Sarac T.; Ochoa Chaar C.I.,"Objective: Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter retrieval rates remain low. Previous literature identified provider and system factors to enhance retrieval, but patients' perspectives have not been studied. This study compared the attitudes of men and women with retained filters to identify patient factors that would increase compliance and facilitate retrieval when indicated. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A retrospective single-center review of all patients undergoing IVC filter placement between 2009 and 2011 was performed. The electronic medical records were reviewed to identify patients with retained filters who were potential candidates for removal. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and indication for filter placement were noted. A telephone survey inquiring about the patient's awareness of IVC filters and risks of leaving them permanently in place was conducted. Additional questions addressed patient-physician relations, preferences in communication, and attitudes toward television commercials on IVC filter lawsuits. Patients' characteristics and survey responses were compared between men and women. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 604 patients who underwent IVC filter placement. The overall retrieval rate was 30%. Telephone survey was conducted for 42 patients with retained filters who were identified as possible candidates for retrieval. There was no difference between the men and women in terms of demographics and comorbidities. The survey demonstrated that 12% of patients were not aware of having an IVC filter, and only 23% knew that it can be removed. Women were significantly more likely than men to know the risks and benefits of IVC filter placement (42.8% vs 14.2%; P <. 03), but there was no significant difference in knowledge of the long-term complications of indwelling filters. Even though the majority of patients (88%) had an established relation with a primary care provider, only 21.4% followed up with the team of physicians of the hospitalization for IVC filter placement. Better education about IVC filters would have improved follow-up in the opinion of 97.6% of patients. Also, 50% relocated since filter placement and 35.7% changed their telephone number. There was no difference regarding use of Internet and interest in receiving educational material, but women (42.8%) significantly preferred receiving health-related communication by electronic mail, whereas men (64%) preferred telephone calls (P = .03). The majority of patients (59.5%) had watched commercials for IVC filter lawsuits, among whom 26% claimed to seek discussion with a medical provider after watching the commercial. The predominant cause for no follow-up was ""unaware of risks of leaving the filter"" (69%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this era of modern medicine, vascular specialists must educate the patient and family about IVC filters and long-term effects to optimize the patient's compliance. Electronic communication for follow-up may help capture patients who relocate and change phone numbers and seems to be particularly attractive to women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery",2019,/,Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders,7,4,507EP  - 513,2001658175,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvsv.2018.11.011,30850353,#922,Aurshina 2019,"",""
Women in Cardiology in Australia-Are We Making Any Progress?,Segan L.; ; Vlachadis Castles A.,"Women remain largely under-represented in cardiology worldwide, despite gender parity among medical graduates. This is particularly notable in procedural subspecialties such as interventional cardiology and electrophysiology and is consistent at all levels of training. Cardiology continues to have the lowest proportion of females of all adult medicine specialties. This is a review of existing literature and statistics pertaining to women in cardiology and highlights the relative paucity of data or publications within Australia. Australian data from the Medical Training Review Panel reported that the proportion of females in cardiology advanced training (~22%) has not changed over the last 9 years and that there is a significant attrition as trainees progress through the various stages of training. In 2018, females represent only 16% of first year cardiology advanced trainees in Victoria and Tasmania. This represents a decrease from 20-25% in previous years. The factors affecting gender parity in cardiology are complex and diverse, from personal reasons such as family planning, work-life balance and perceived gender bias, to recruitment inertia and an imbalance in opportunities for career progression, research, financial remuneration and leadership positions. Worldwide, a number of initiatives have been explored to address the gender divide in cardiology, including networking and mentorship programs and Women in Cardiology working groups, dedicated to addressing the issue of female under-representation in cardiology. Unfortunately, the progress we are seeing worldwide is not being realised in Australia. A collaborative approach is essential to achieve gender parity in cardiology. This involves introspection and accountability by College bodies and policy changes committed to promoting workplace diversity by welcoming and retaining female talent. We must recognise and address the current barriers and support women pursuing a career in cardiology.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",2019,/,Heart Lung and Circulation,28,5,690EP  - 696,2001541819,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2018.12.010,30738714,#924,Segan 2019,"",""
Results of the British Society of Gastroenterology supporting women in gastroenterology mentoring scheme pilot,Smith K.H.; ; Hallett R.J.; Wilkinson-Smith V.; Neild P.J.; Brooks A.J.; Lockett M.J.; Thomas-Gibson S.; Eaden J.A.; Edwards C.,"Introduction Mentorship has long been recognised as beneficial in the business world and has more recently been endorsed by medical and academic professional bodies. Recruitment of women into gastroenterology and leadership roles has traditionally been difficult. The Supporting Women in Gastroenterology network developed this pilot scheme for female gastroenterologists 5 years either side of the Completion Certificate of Specialist Training (CCST) to examine the role that mentorship could play in improving this discrepancy. Method Female gastroenterology trainees and consultant gastroenterologists within 5 years either side of CCST were invited to participate as mentees. Consultant gastroenterologists of both genders were invited to become mentors. 35 pairs of mentor:mentees were matched and completed the scheme over 1 year. Training was provided. Results The majority of the mentees found the sessions useful (82%) and enjoyable (77%), with the benefit of having time and space to discuss professional or personal challenges with a gastroenterologist who is not a colleague. In the longitudinal study of job satisfaction, work engagement, burnout, resilience, self-efficacy, self-compassion and work-life balance, burnout scale showed a small but non significant improvement over the year (probably an effect of small sample size). Personal accomplishment improved significantly. The main challenges were geography, available time to meet and pair matching. The majority of mentors surveyed found the scheme effective, satisfying, mutually beneficial (70%) and enjoyable (78%). Conclusion Mentorship is shown to be beneficial despite the challenges and is likely to improve the recruitment and retention of women into gastroenterology and leadership roles, but is likely to benefit gastroenterologists of both genders.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Author(s).

Assessment of buccal vestibular depth among completely edentulous patients,Shahzan M.S.; ; Gounder R.; Ganapathy D.,"Introduction: The buccal vestibule is the area bounded by the alveolar gingiva, buccal mucosa, buccal frenum, and hamular notch. The range of vestibular width and depth can vary considerably among different individuals. Since resorption of the posterior edentulous arch begins from the buccal side as the edentulous residual ridge continues to atrophy, the vestibule becomes wider and shallower and the elliptical curvature of the vestibular fornix becomes less acute. When fabricating a denture, the buccal flange of the denture should fit into and fill the vestibular space. Mismanagement of the vestibular space can result in a number of significant problems. The extension of vestibular depth is important in complete denture fabrication for stability and retention. This study helps in knowing the extension pattern of buccal vestibular depth in partially and completely edentulous patients which acts as an important aid for the better success of denture fabrication. The aim of this survey is to assess the buccal vestibular depth among complete edentulous patients. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 100 randomly selected subjects with complete dentures, fabricated within the past 5 months, were examined. The subjects were patients in Saveetha Dental College. The depth and width of the buccal vestibule of each subject were measured at anterior (1 mm posterior to the buccal frenum) and posterior (1 mm anterior to the hamular notch). The anterior and posterior locations were marked with a eosin pencil. The denture was then inserted, and the reference marks were transferred from the alveolar residual ridges to the denture. Next, each subject was instructed to open their mouth half way and the cheek was illuminated with a mouth mirror. The depth of the vestibule was measured from the crest of the residual alveolar ridge to the fornix of the buccal vestibule with a periodontal probe. The differences between the dimensions of the maxillary buccal vestibule and the corresponding buccal flanges were analyzed by paired t-tests. The differences between the sexes were compared by two sample t-tests. The significance level was set at P < 0.05, and the data were analyzed with the statistical program JMP 7.0 software. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 100 subjects were included in this study. The mean depth of the buccal vestibule increased from the anterior to the posterior region of the vestibule. The statistical mean results for each corresponding anatomic and prosthetic location demonstrated significant differences in depth. The difference in the mean vestibular depths and flange length in the posterior area was nearly 10.6 mm and 7.4 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): At each location, there was a statistically significant difference in the depth of the buccal vestibule when compared with the corresponding regions of the existing denture among the 100 subjects. The difference in the mean depth between the vestibules and the flanges in the posterior area was 10.6 mm and 7.4 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). The buccal vestibular flanges of the dentures were significantly inadequate in mimicking the depth dimensions of the buccal vestibule.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 JPR Solutions.All right reserved.",2019,/,Drug Invention Today,11,1,256EP  - 258,627108134,,,#927,Shahzan 2019,"",""
Defining Barriers and Facilitators to Advancement for Women in Academic Surgery,Thompson-Burdine J.A.; ; Telem D.A.; Waljee J.F.; Newman E.A.; Coleman D.M.; Stoll H.I.; Sandhu G.,"Importance: Sex equity is elusive in academic surgery departments across the United States. Persistent inequities remain a considerable problem and inhibit professional advancement for female surgeons. Identifying the factors that promulgate sex discrepancies may provide a framework for institutional growth and personal progress for women. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify barriers and facilitators to success at the individual and organizational level to develop evidence-based interventions designed to close the sex gap in surgery. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This qualitative study included 26 female participants who were current and former surgical faculty employed by Michigan Medicine, the health system of the University of Michigan, between 2000 and 2017. Semistructured personal interviews were conducted from June 28 to September 29, 2017, via telephone. Each interview lasted 45 minutes to 1 hour. Interviews were recorded and then transcribed for analysis. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: The interview included 7 questions referring to the surgeon's experience with the Michigan Medicine Department of Surgery and 7 questions referring to nonspecific areas of interest. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The 26 participants in this study ranged in age from 32 to 64 years, with faculty experience ranging from 3 to 22 years. Thematic analysis was used to locate, analyze, and report patterns within the data related to barriers and facilitators for women in academic medicine. Three major themes were identified by researchers.

"Scholarly Collaboration, Mentorship, and Friendship: A New Model for Success in Academic Medicine",Abramson E.L.; ; Naifeh M.M.; Stevenson M.D.; Li S.-T.T.,"Mentorship can be one of the most important factors in helping faculty members successfully advance academic careers. Finding effective mentorship, however, is extremely challenging and lack of mentorship may negatively impact productivity, promotion, and retention. Women, in particular, identify lack of mentorship as a major factor inhibiting career advancement, which in turn may be one element contributing to the significant gender gaps existing in academic medicine. Here, we describe a model of mentoring drawn from our personal experiences as 4 female faculty that has resulted in a successful collaboration spanning nearly a decade. This model combines different elements of mentoring models previously described in the literature into a single model of network mentoring. Our model aims to promote longitudinal, collaborative scholarship around a broad common research theme, provide long-term mentorship focused on successfully navigating personal and academic hurdles, and create a forum of mentorship for faculty at all academic ranks. Keys to the success of our model, The Accelerate Scholarship through Personal Engagement with a Collaborative Team (ASPECT) Model, are: 1) a shared overarching research goal that allows for multiple projects to be worked on over time; 2) regular, structured meetings; 3) a collaborative yet flexible arrangement with ""group accountability""; and 4) a focus on the human connection. Our goal in writing this paper is to describe, in detail, lessons learned from our experiences and reflect on why and how this model may be effective in addressing mentoring gaps many faculty members, particularly women, experience.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Academic Pediatric Association",2019,/,Academic Pediatrics,19,8,860EP  - 864,2002931547,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2019.07.010,31382043,#929,Abramson 2019,"",""
Organisational best practices towards gender equality in science and medicine,Coe I.R.; ; Wiley R.; Bekker L.-G.,"In August 2018, the president of the World Bank noted that ""'Human capital'-the potential of individuals-is going to be the most important long-term investment any country can make for its people's future prosperity and quality of life"". Nevertheless, leaders and practitioners in academic science and medicine continue to be unaware of and poorly educated about the nature, extent, and impact of barriers to full participation of women and minorities in science and medicine around the world. This lack of awareness and education results in failures to fully mobilise the human capital of half the population and limits global technological and medical advancements. The chronic lack of recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in science and medicine is due to systemic, structural, organisational, institutional, cultural, and societal barriers to equity and inclusion. These barriers must be identified and removed through increased awareness of the challenges combined with evidence-based, data-driven approaches leading to measurable targets and outcomes. In this Review, we discuss these issues and highlight actions that could achieve gender equality in science and medicine. We survey approaches and insights that have helped to identify and remove systemic bias and barriers in science and medicine, and propose tools that will help organisational change toward gender equality. We describe tools that include formal legislation and mandated quotas at national or large-scale levels (eg, gender parity), techniques that increase fairness (eg, gender equity) through facilitated organisational cultural change at institutional levels, and professional development of core competencies at individual levels. This Review is not intended to be an extensive analysis of all the literature currently available on achieving gender equality in academic medicine and science, but rather, a reflection on finding multifactorial solutions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,/,The Lancet,393,10171,587EP  - 593,2001543338,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2818%2933188-X,30739694,#930,Coe 2019,"",""

Within GIM, there are fewer female division directors, first/last authors and presenters at national meetings. Academic Hospital (AH) medicine is a growing field and studies raise a concern about gender equity. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A national survey via Qualtrics  of all leaders of AH programs associated with AAMC. Survey was developed via literature review, discussion/pilot with experts, in collaboration with the Society of Hospital Medicine. Domains included program/faculty information and perceptions about promotion. Gender of the leader was determined via website or telephone. Programs excluded if no identifiable primary teaching hospital or hospitalist program, or not staffed by university-affiliated physicians. Means, standard deviations, medians, and proportions were used to describe data distribution. Chi-square, Fisher's Exact test, and t-test were used in univariate analysis to compare respondents and non-respondents, and to determine if leader and program characteristics were significantly associated with being in the lowest quartile of female faculty. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted associations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 58% response rate (78 of 135); no differences of non-responders in NIH funding, public v. private, geographic region or year established. Reported number of female and male faculty approximately equal. 73% of hospitalist leaders were male; 38% of male leaders were professors, no female leaders were professors. In univariate analysis, there were no gender associated differences regarding importance of scholarship for promotion but programs with the highest quartile of associate and professors had lowest quartile of female faculty. Other predictors of having lowest quartile of female faculty include less NIH funding, single promotion track, more time with learners, fewer total faculty, and fewer faculty ranked instructor. In the multivariable regression model, institutions with lowest quartile of NIH funding were significantly associated with the lowest quartile of female faculty (odds ratio=3.54, p=0.049) after adjusting for covariates. Having lower female faculty was not associated with amount of protected time, GIM versus independent division/department, region, or number of faculty remaining in hospital medicine long-term. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated gender issues in academic hospital medicine, especially regarding leadership and rank. Though equal gender distribution of faculty with similar plans to remain in AH, leaders are predominately male, no female leaders are professors and programs reporting higher numbers of female faculty were most likely to report lower rates of faculty at the associate and professor rank.

Sexual dimorphism in the mandibular canine - A study in South Indian population,Vinay J.; ; Balaji R.V.S.; Anand Kumar V.; Thejaswini P.,"Introduction: Teeth are found to be a very useful tool for forensic investigations because of their nature, exhibiting the least turnover of natural structure and effective resistance to mechanical, chemical, physical or thermal destructions. In addition, teeth are readily accessible structure for examination. Amongst all the teeth, the mandibular canine found to exhibit greatest sexual dimorphism. Considering the fact that there are differences in odontometric features in specific populations, the present study was taken up to investigate whether Mandibular Canine Width (MCW), Inter-Canine Distance (ICD) and Mandibular Canine Index (MCI) can be used as a tool for sex determination in South Indian Population. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): 'The present study was carried out on 60 apparently healthy individuals from students of Medical college who are origin of south India whose ages ranged between 17-21 years in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry in the Sri Muthukumaran Medical College Hospital and Research Institute to establish significance of sexual dimorphism in the mandibular canine. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The present study confirms that, the means of mandibular canine width and an inter-canine distance were higher in males than in the females and difference is statistically significant.

Weathering the storm: Strategies for managing bullying in the health care setting,Gregorio S.W.-D.; ,"Background/Purpose: Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior where one person (or group of people) in a position of power deliberately intimidates, abuses, or coerces an individual. Although presented with the act of bullying most frequently in the realm of childhood education, bullying is prevalent in medical settings. Previous studies indicate higher rates of bullying among residents and fellows (48%) and nurses (44%) than physicians (5-10%) and other specialists, with some gender discrepancies. Bullying can contribute to productivity losses, absenteeism, team conflicts and employee mental and physical health issues. There is limited data from psychosocial oncologists on the prevalence, predictive factors, and mitigation strategies for bullying on interdisciplinary teams. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this presentation, we will review the current literature on bullying in health care, address common bullying myths and provide additional information on psychosocial oncologists' experiences of bullying. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We will review the most common effects of bullying as well as strategies for managing bullying in the health care setting, from both a person-centered and an administrative level. Similar to relaxation, these strategies are best applied early and often, not when bullying starts, in order to achieve the best results. Conclusions and Implications: Bullying is common in the health care setting. It is essential for psychosocial oncologists to recognize bullying and respond in ways that are most likely to resolve conflicts, preserve dignity, improve patient care, improve working conditions, and reduce turnover.",2019,/,Psycho-Oncology,28,Supplement 1,14,626768143,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pon.4986,,#939,Gregorio 2019,"",""
Support structures for female physicians: Motivations and barriers to gender-specific conferences and symposia,Jain S.; ; Graff S.L.; Swaroop M.; Woitowich N.C.,"Background: While nearly half of all medical school graduates are female, women remain underrepresented in the physician workforce. Conferences or symposia designed to address issues relevant to female physicians, such as gender-bias, sexual harassment, and work-life balance are one strategy to improve retention and advancement, yet, limited data exists surrounding their utility. To address this gap, we surveyed a multi-disciplinary group of female physicians to identify motivations or barriers to attendance. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An online survey instrument was distributed nationally via social media and shared by respondents. The survey assessed participants' demographics, attendance at genderspecific conferences or symposia, motivations or barriers to attendance, and perceived benefits of attendance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 792 respondents, 34% had attended a conference or symposia for women in medicine, while 66% had not. Attendees were significantly more likely to hold a leadership position (68% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001), an academic faculty position (74% vs. 56%, p < 0.0001), and have received a professional accolade within the past year (42% vs. 28%, p < 0.0001). Non-attendees were significantly more likely to be the primary caregiver for children or seniors (64% vs. 56%, p = 0.042). Respondents indicated that an interest in discussion topics, a sense of community, and growth of professional network were key motivators in attendance. The majority of respondents indicated that attendance improved their self-advocacy, self-image, and leadership skills. Of those who did not attend, 5 1% were unaware of such conferences or symposia. Those who were aware, but unable to attend, cited lack of time as the major barrier to participation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results of this study provide preliminary data surrounding gender-specific conferences or symposia for women in medicine and highlight opportunities for increased engagement.

YEAR TO YEAR TRENDS OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ACADEMIC MEDICAL SOCIETY FELLOWSHIPS,Khan R.; ; Das A.; Huebert C.; Carroll C.,"SESSION TITLE: Tuesday Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/22/2019 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM PURPOSE: Studies have shown there is a disparity in academic career achievement for female physicians in retention, rank, and leadership roles. Obtaining Fellow status in an academic medical society is an important marker of success, but there is little data describing the trends in gender and medical society fellows. Our goal is to describe the trends of gender and academic advancement as defined by the designation of Fellow in an academic medical society. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Using a retrospective analysis of data obtained from the American College of CHEST Physicians, we described and compared characteristics of female and male applicants for the designation of Fellow within the College of CHEST Physicians (FCCP) for 2018. Next, we compared this data to applicants in 2017. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In 2018, 23% (28/123) of applicants for FCCP were women, compared to 20% (21/105) in 2017 (p=0.63). In 2018, 84% (103/123) were U.S. based, and 93% (115/123) were physicians. When examining subspecialty, 67% identified themselves as primarily pulmonary clinicians, 25% as primarily critical care, and 8% identified as doing some sleep medicine. The median age of applicants was 39 years (range 30-59 years). When comparing characteristics of female and male applicants in 2018, there were no differences in the ages (p=0.34), country of residence (p=0.56), or subspecialty (p=0.85). In 2018, most of applicants had the letters of recommendation written by men; 75% (70/123) had both written by men, 26% (32/123) had a female and a male letter, and only 4% (5/123) had both letters written by women. Gender of applicant was not associated with gender of recommendation letter writers, nor were these frequencies different from 2017. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): There were no significant differences in applicants for FCCP between 2017 and 2018. The overall female applicants continue to fall below the national average of female physicians (30%). Mostly male mentorship for applicants persists, as demonstrated by letters of recommendation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The American Board of Internal Medicine reports increasing percentages of first-year female fellows entering pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, 32% and 44% respectively, which demonstrates a rising demographic of possible future leaders within the organization. This highlights the importance of needed sponsorship for junior female faculty and FCCP recruitment campaigns targeted to a female audience.

Editorial (Spring) Board? Gender Composition in High-impact General Surgery Journals over 20 Years,Harris C.A.; ; Banerjee T.; Cramer M.; Manz S.; Ward S.T.; Dimick J.; Telem D.A.,"Objective: To quantify gender composition of 10 high-impact general surgery journals, delineate how board composition has changed over time, and evaluate qualification metrics by gender. <ovid:br/>Background(s): Underrepresentation of women on editorial boards may contribute to the gender-based achievement gap in surgery. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the editorial board gender composition among 10 high-impact general surgery journals in 1997, 2007, and 2017. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to assess differences in editors' H-indices, academic rank, and number of advanced degrees. Differences in editor turnover and multiple board positions were evaluated for each time interval. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Over 20 years, the proportion of women on editorial boards increased from 5% to 19%. After controlling for time since board certification, no differences between men and women's number of advanced degrees, H-indices, or academic rank remained significant. Women and men were equally likely to hold multiple board positions (1997 P = 0.74; 2007 P = 0.42; 2017 P = 0.69), but men's editorial board tenure was longer across each time interval (1997-2007 P = 0.003; 2007-2017 P < 0.001; 1997-2017 P = 0.01). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Women surgeons have a small but growing presence on surgical editorial boards, and gender-based qualification differences are likely attributable to practice length. Men's longer tenure on editorial boards may drive some of the observed disparity by limiting new appointment opportunities. Strategies such as imposing term limits or instituting merit-based performance reviews may help editorial boards capture the field's changing demographics.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Assessing Mentorship Experiences of Faculty at a Military Academic Center: Challenge and Opportunity,McMains K.C.; ; Rodriguez R.G.; Peel J.; Yun H.C.; True M.W.; Jones W.S.,"Objectives Mentor relationships are a key component of professional development within academic medicine. To date, there are no investigations into the prevalence and effects of mentor relationships within military academic medicine. This quality improvement initiative aimed to establish the prevalence and effects of mentorship, including whether sex differences exist among faculty at a military academic center, the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, and identify opportunities to improve faculty development efforts for mentorship to benefit faculty at this institution. Methods A 17-item survey was developed using an iterative process. Using the SurveyMonkey platform, the survey was distributed to each faculty member within the 33 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited programs. Results A total of 104 responses (26%) were received from 393 total faculty members, including 48 Air Force, 45 Army, 3 Navy, and 8 Contractor/Government Service respondents. Thirty-four respondents were women (33%) and 70 were men (67%). Only 42% of faculty reported currently having a mentor. Thirty-nine respondents (38%; 44% men and 27% women) received formal mentorship at their first staff physician position after residency training. Mentorship helped respondents the most in the areas of clinical skills, understanding departmental/institutional culture, professionalism/officership, academic promotion/advancement, and clarification of priorities/goals. When asked whether more effective mentorship would affect their own decision to remain on active-duty military service, 14% responded ""yes"" and 28% responded ""possibly."" Conclusions Increased mentorship has the potential to positively affect career development in military academic military medicine.

The number of female physicians is increasing; however, young female physicians are less willing to work at university hospitals under the given conditions. They often do not find appropriate working conditions in mostly hierarchically structured university hospitals. Institutional structures involuntarily erect barriers against the recruitment, retention, and career progression of women. Gendered working conditions remain firmly fixed, and this is even more challenging - overt discrimination has been replaced by less visible mostly implicit stereotypes and prejudices against women. Having children is an additional ""career stopper"" for female physicians: those with children are less likely to be promoted and have a lower income.

Surgical gender gap: A curriculum concordance and career vector perspective,Brown C.; ; Harries R.L.; Abdelrahman T.; Thomas C.; Pollitt M.J.; Lewis W.G.,"Introduction Women's participation in medicine has increased dramatically during the last 50 years, yet Office for National Statistics data (2016) regarding annual pay continue to show an unequivocal 34% deficit in female doctors' remuneration compared with their male counterparts. This study aimed to identify whether there are measurable differences in the training, career vectors and profiles of higher general surgical trainees (HSTs), related to gender. Method The Deanery roster supplemented with Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme and Scopus data was used to identify the profiles of 101 consecutive HSTs (38 women, 63 men, single UK deanery). Primary outcome measures were training programme attrition rate, time to completion of training and achievement of third level 4 competence (3L4C) in indicative operations. Secondary outcomes were publication number, citations and Hirsch Indices (HIs). Results Attrition rates were similar irrespective of gender (female n=3 (7.9%) vs male n=6 (9.5%), p=0.871). Training duration was on average 16 months longer in women (94 (72-134) months) than men (78 (72-112), p=0.002). Operative learning curve trajectories were similar; median operations required to achieve 3L4C was 380 (f) versus 410 (m, p=1.00). Academic profiles of men were stronger than women, specifically higher degrees; men (n=31, 83.8%), women (n=6, 16.2%, p=0.001); median (range) publication number 8 (0-57) versus 3 (0-38, p=0.003), citations 43 (0-1600) versus 9 (0-774, p=0.001), and HI 3 (0-26) versus 2 (0-12, p=0.002).

A systematic review of interventions to support the careers of women in academic medicine and other disciplines,Laver K.E.; ; Prichard I.J.; Cations M.; Osenk I.; Govin K.; Coveney J.D.,"Objective To summarise quantitative evaluations of interventions designed to support the careers of women in academia of any discipline. Method A systematic search of English entries in PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar was conducted in September 2017. Methodological quality of the studies was independently assessed by two authors using the Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in methods and outcomes; results were synthesised and displayed narratively. Results Eighteen eligible studies were identified, mostly evaluating programmes in academic medicine departments. The most common interventions were mentoring, education, professional development and/or networking programmes. All programmes took a 'bottom-up' approach in that women were responsible for opting into and devoting time to participation. Study quality was low overall, but all studies reported positive outcomes on at least one indicator. Most often this included improvements in self-rated skills and capabilities, or satisfaction with the programme offered. Results regarding tangible outcomes were mixed; while some studies noted improvements in promotion, retention and remuneration, others did not. Conclusions This review suggests that targeted programmes have the potential to improve some outcomes for women in academia. However, the studies provide limited high-quality evidence to provide information for academic institutions in terms of the best way to improve outcomes for women in academia. The success of an intervention appears to be undermined when it relies on the additional labour of those it is intending to support (ie, 'bottom-up' approaches). As such, academic institutions should consider and evaluate the efficacy of 'top-down' interventions that start with change in practice of higher management.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Article author(s).",2018,/,BMJ Open,8,3,e020380,623793749,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020380,29572397,#951,Laver 2018,"",""
Is Robotic-Assisted Inguinal Hernia Repair Comparable or Superior to Laparoscopic Approach?,Gomez P.P.; ; Mazzini G.S.; Khoraki J.; Aquilina G.R.; Salluzzo J.; Campos G.M.,"INTRODUCTION: Outcomes and costs of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs have been reported in a few retrospective case series, with conflicting results.

Is there a gender or racial promotion disparity in academic urology?,Breyer B.; ; Fang R.; Anger J.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Over the past decade, increasing numbers of women are entering academic urology, promoting more gender balance in a field long dominated by men. Reports have shown that women advance along academic promotion in many fields of medicine and surgery more slowly than men for unclear reasons. Timely promotion and assessment is important for retention of faculty and has implications for salary parity and job satisfaction. We sought to better understand promotion time lines across gender and race/ethnicity and how academic output impacts promotion. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We examined data from the 2017 AUA Census. A subset cohort that endorsed having an academic appointment were asked questions regarding their promotion time line. We obtained demographic and academic output information including the number of peer-reviewed articles published and types of grants obtained (NIH, DOD, PCORI, other federal agencies and foundationfunded grants). Complex survey weights were used to make population projections. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 554 urologists endorsed having an academic appointment, representing 2,991 urologists in academic medical centers in the United States. Among those 2,991 academic urologists, 12.6% of them are women, 80.3% are white, 6.5% are Hispanic. On average, women took 1.2 years longer than men to advance from Assistant to Associate Professor,7.3 years (95% CI 6.8-7.8) vs 6.1 years, 95% CI 5.7-6.5, p<0.001). Advancement from Associate to Professor was similar in women and men (6.0 years (95% CI 5.1-6.9) vs. 6.4 (95% CI 5.8-7, p<0001). The time line for promotion was not statistically different across race/ethnicity. Women were less likely to be a principal investigator (PI) on a federal grant than men, although this did not reach statistical significance (33.5% (95% CI 24.1-44.4% vs 47.5% (95% CI 42.4-52.6%, p=0.893). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Women took 1.2 years longer to reach Associate Professor than men, while there was parity in promotion to Professor. Race/ethnicity did not appear to impact the number of years to promotion. Further research is needed to elucidate whether child rearing, gender bias, or other factors are associated with a delay in promotion of women in urology.

A survey was created using Surveymonkey.com and sent to 65 women who had been invited to the forum over the five year period. Responses were received from 26/65 (40%) of women surveyed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Junior faculty constituted 42% of attendees, with fellows (35%), residents (27%), mid-career (23%) and senior faculty (4%) attending in descending frequency. 100% of responders indicated that they found the content valuable to their professional development. Virtually all attendees agreed that including both faculty and trainees enhanced their experience, with only one faculty indicating they felt inclusion of trainees diminished the experience. 95% of respondents found the time of day for the program (4 to 5 pm) to be appropriate. The content topics rated as most useful were 'Increased awareness of issues facing women in science' (95%), 'Increased knowledge of faculty development programs and resources' (89%) and 'Increased awareness of unconscious bias' (74%). A panel discussion with high profile successful women was the highest rated guest speaker event. 'Career development strategies' was the highest rated topic covered. 'Women Don't Ask' and 'Ask for It' by Linda Babcock & Sara Laschever were tied for the highest rated books reviewed, and 'Speaking out about gender imbalance in invited speakers improves diversity' (Klein R et al. Nature Immunology 2016;18: 475-77) was the highest rated article covered in the forum. A session on promotion by the department chairman was rated highly. Questions such as 'most valuable session' and 'suggestions for future sessions' were also addressed. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Here we describe the formation of a successful professional development program for women within a pathology department at a major medical school. The most valuable topics covered in this forum included unconscious bias and negotiation skills for women. This format could easily be replicated in any academic department. Knowledge of what topics women found most valuable can help direct the content and enhance successful outcomes of these types of professional development programs.",2018,/,Clinical Chemistry,64,Supplement 1,S191,624175210,,,#955,Gronowski 2018,"",""
Surgical Gender Gap: A Curriculum Concordance and Career Vector Perspective,Brown C.; ; Abdelrahman T.; Powell A.G.; Pollitt M.J.; Hopkins L.G.R.; Robinson D.; Lewis W.G.,"INTRODUCTION: Women's participation in medicine has increased dramatically during the last 50 years, yet annual pay continues to show an unequivocal 34% gap and deficit in female doctors' remuneration compared with male counterparts. This study aimed to identify whether measurable differences exist in the training, career vectors, and profiles of higher general surgical trainees (HSTs), related to gender. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The Scopus database identified the profiles of 101 consecutive HSTs (38 female, 63 male, single United Kingdom deanery) supplemented with Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme data. Primary outcomes measures were training program attrition rate, times taken to achieve level-4 competences in indicative operations, and certificate of completion of training (CCT) related to gender. Secondary outcomes were numbers of publications, citations, and Hirsch Indices (HI). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Attrition rates were similar irrespective of gender (female, n=3 [7.9%] vs male, n=6 [9.5%], p=0.871). Time to complete training was, on average, 16 months longer in females (94 [range 72 to 134] months) than males (78 [range 72 to 112] months, p=0.002). Operative learning curve trajectory was similar irrespective of gender; median operations required to achieve the 3rd level-4 competence (3L4C) was 380 (female) vs 410 (male, p=1.00). Academic profiles of males were stronger than those of females, specifically: higher degrees were more common among males (n=31, 83.8%) than females (n=6, 16.2%, p=0.001); median (range) publication numbers 8 (0 to 57) vs 3 (0 to 38, p=0.003), citations 43 (0 to 1,600) vs 9 (0 to 774, p=0.001), and HI 3 (0 to 26) vs 2 (0 to 12, p=0.002). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): A complex gender gap was apparent, related to time in training and academic profile, but not training attrition or operative learning-curve trajectory.",2018,/,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,227,4 Supplement 1,S231EP  - S232,638696525,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.07.507,,#956,Brown 2018,"",""
Identification of gender-based linguistic differences within trainee evaluations of faculty using natural language processing techniques,Heath J.K.; ; Weissman G.E.; Baston C.; Bittner J.; Dine C.J.,"Rationale: Teaching performance evaluations are widely used for promotion and retention decisions. To date, no studies have assessed gender differences within trainee evaluation comments of medical faculty. We therefore analyzed trainee evaluations of Pulmonary and Critical Care (PCC) faculty within the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) to determine gender-based patterns in free-text comments using natural language processing techniques. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of all trainee evaluations of HUP PCC faculty during the 2015-2016 academic year. Trainee evaluations (including medical students, residents, and fellows) consisted of numeric ratings across several different factors (on a 5-point rating scale), a cumulative numeric score (on a 5-point rating scale), and free-text comments. We performed descriptive analyses of numeric ratings by gender and trainee level. We also performed n-gram text-mining to convert free-text comments into words and phrases for subsequent analysis. We included all words with >2% prevalence for analysis, clustered on stem of word to avoid duplicates, and calculated odds ratios (OR) using contingency tables. Statistical significance was determined with chi-2 analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 1218 evaluations of HUP PCC faculty were submitted during 2015-2016, including 400 of female faculty and 817 of male faculty. There were no differences in cumulative numeric teaching rating (mean 4.7 vs 4.6, p-value 0.08) or total evaluation word count (mean 47.2 vs 51.0, p-value 0.88) by gender. Figure 1 displays the ORs of stem words within free-text evaluations associated with gender (all p<0.05). Overall, the words ""positive"" (OR 2.8), ""encourage"" (OR 2.1), ""kind"" (OR 2.10), ""together"" (OR 1.9), ""comfort"" (OR 1.8), and ""physician"" (OR 1.8) were associated with female faculty. The words ""humor"" (OR 2.7), ""care"" (OR 1.5), ""team"" (OR 1.3), and ""patient"" (OR 1.3) were associated with male faculty. Additional associations that did not reach statistical significance were noted with the words ""fun,"" ""independent,"" ""push,"" ""leader,"" ""team,"" and ""member,"" for male faculty, and ""sure,"" ""manage,"" ""dedicate,"" and ""impress,"" for female faculty. Notably, the words ""teacher"" and ""clinician"" did not have a significant association with gender. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite the widespread use of teaching evaluations for promotion and retention decisions within academic medicine, little is known about the association of faculty gender with trainee free-text evaluation comments. Our data demonstrate quantitative linguistic differences between trainee evaluation free-text comments of female versus male faculty. Further evaluation of the impact of these differences, particularly in relation to ongoing gender disparities in faculty promotion and retention, is warranted.

Finding mentorship for the skull base trainee,Richardson A.M.; ; Armstrong V.L.; Morcos J.J.,"Background: More than half of medical students are women, but gender disparities continue to exist in neurosurgical and otolaryngology residency programs. This difference is more pronounced in neurosurgery, where women have lower entry rates and higher attrition rates compared with males (17 vs. 5.3%). A lack of role models and mentorship has been identified as barriers to success by female trainees in academic medicine. Some studies suggest that female trainees may benefit from female role models and/or mentors, while others contend that gender is irrelevant. Skull base pathology requires an interdisciplinary approach usually requiring input from neuroradiologists, otolaryngologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologist, oncologists, and neurosurgeons. Given the involvement of specialties with higher rates of female participation, we hypothesized that gender differences observed in neurosurgery would be less pronounced in the interdisciplinary skull base field. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was performed to identify the rates of female involvement at various career stages from applying to residency to chairing an academic program. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 2012 to 2016, 19% of applicants per year to neurosurgical residency programs were female; 31% of applicants per year for otolaryngology. Currently there are nine neurosurgery programs with none female residents (2.9% of programs). The leadership of neurosurgery residency programs is mainly male-three female department chairs (2 interim; 2.8%) and seven female program directors (6.5%). Editorial boards of neurosurgery journals contain few women (JNS 0% female, JNS: Spine 0%, JNS: Pediatrics 17%, combined 5.7% female), with higher rates of women in otolaryngology (JAMA-Otolaryngology 25%, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 35%, Laryngoscope 19.6%, combined 24%). The Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B Skull Base has 8.3% females on the editorial board. Fellowship directors are largely male with only one female listed as a codirector of a neurosurgery fellowship while ENT has two females listed. The North American Skull Base Society (NASBS) annual meeting has female participation on the Scientific Program Committee, but sparse female representation on the Executive Committee, Directors at Large, and Board of Advisors (1 female in any of these roles over 2 years compared with 41 males). In 2016, women composed 9.6% of faculty and in 2017, 15.5% were female. Although female participation is increasing at multiple levels, the ranks of the ""master surgeons"" who speak at the NASBS national meeting are almost all male (1 female, 60 males with 2016 and 2017 participants combined). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): As compared with otolaryngology, neurosurgery has fewer females applying to residency, completing training, acting in leadership positions, and participating on editorial boards. More women are entering these fields than in the past and as this generation of surgeons finishes training, we will likely see an increase in female leadership. For women currently in training, an interdisciplinary field such as skull base surgery with comparatively higher rates of female participation, particularly at national meetings, provides trainees with networking opportunities and the identification of female mentors/role models even if they are of a different specialty.",2018,/,"Journal of Neurological Surgery, Part B: Skull Base",79,Supplement 1,,621380716,https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1633614,,#958,Richardson 2018,"",""
Gender and international clinician educators,Stadler D.J.; ; Archuleta S.; Ibrahim H.; Shah N.G.; Al-Mohammed A.A.; Cofrancesco J.,"Objectives To describe gender differences of international clinician educators (CEs) and leaders, and CEs' perceptions by gender of preparation, roles, rewards and factors affecting job satisfaction and retention in emerging international competency-based residency programmes. Methods Cross-sectional surveys of CEs and leadership were conductedJune 2013-June 2014 at institutions that had adopted competency-based graduate medical education and were accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International. Results 274 (76.3%) of 359 eligible participants responded; 69 (25.2%) were female. Two (18%) of 11 chief executive officers and 1 (9%) of 11 chief medical officers were women. Female CEs were younger, more likely to be single and childless. They were less likely to hold academic appointments, despite no gender differences in length of time at current institution or in current position. A greater proportion of female CEs felt they were never' rewarded by academic promotion. Satisfaction rates were similar between the genders. Single female CEs were five times as likely to report being extremely likely' to stay in the country. Female CEs with children <21 were less likely to report high likelihood of staying in academia. Marital status and children were not associated with outcomes for male CEs. Conclusions In the international academic medicine programmes studied, there were fewer female CEs in the pipeline and they perceived a gender gap in appointment and advancement. Stakeholders at international programmes need to develop contextualised strategies to expand entry and decrease attrition of women into CE tracks, and promote gender equity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

To be or not to be rheumatologist: survey among Belgian medical students and internal medicine trainees: what do certified rheumatologists think about the current rheumatology training program?,Wittoek R.; ; Mielants H.,"In several countries, there have been increasing concerns over the years that fewer medical students or trainees choose rheumatology as a specialty. The aim of this three-step survey is to study the motivational factors for students and trainees in internal medicine to choose for rheumatology as a future career option and the idea among experienced rheumatologists about the needs for changes in the training program. An online survey was distributed among students in medical training (in the final 3 years) and trainees in internal medicine from the Ghent University and University Hospital. Questions concerned the level of clinical exposure to rheumatology and the motivation about becoming rheumatologist. Next, experienced rheumatologists were asked about the needs to change the current training. Descriptive data are shown and chi-squared tests were calculated to assess differences between groups (based on gender and exposure). Logistic regression was performed to study associations between demographic variables and choosing rheumatology as career. Only a minority of students (17%) and about half of trainees (45%) were ever exposed to rheumatology. Only 11% of students and 17% of trainees considered becoming rheumatologist. There was no difference in choice based on gender but previous exposure seemed to play an important role, and especially during the pre-specialty years. Univariate logistic regression identified the year of training and exposure as predictors for choosing rheumatology. Multivariate analysis only retained exposure as significantly associated (odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.88 (1.51-12.58)). Rheumatology is considered to be a fascinating discipline among Belgian students and trainees. Exposure during pre-specialty years is the strongest predictor for choosing rheumatology as future career option.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",2017,/,Clinical Rheumatology,36,12,2805EP  - 2812,616223620,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-017-3673-y,28508103,#962,Wittoek 2017,"",""

Burnout in board certified emergency medicine physicians,Lall M.D.; ; Linden J.A.; Madsen T.E.; Garg N.; Perman S.; Barger J.M.; Whyte K.; Gipps A.,"Background: Burnout is prevalent among emergency physicians and may cause physicians to consider leaving the practice of EM. Factors that contribute to burnout are numerous and include gender, practice setting, and age. This study sought to determine whether there is a gender difference in physicians who reported they have seriously considered leaving the specialty of Emergency Medicine or in factors contributing to burnout. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Secondary analysis of the 2014 American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) Longitudinal Survey of Emergency Physicians (LSEP). The survey was sent to ABEM delegates/LSEP participants. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine which factors, including gender, were associated with a serious consideration of leaving the specialty, adjusting for multiple factors that may be a problem in one's everyday work including individual, departmental and institutional factors. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Response rate was 82%, 868 participants. The median age of respondents was 54 (IQR 43-63 yrs) with 22.7% (197) females, 86.24% (746) whites, and 85.3% (745) married. Of the respondents, 37.2% of women vs. 36.99% of men reported ever seriously considered leaving the specialty (p=0.03). However, after adjusting for confounders, gender had no significant association (aOR 1.01, 95%CI 0.61-1.69). Serious consideration of leaving the specialty was associated with older age (aOR 1.06 per year, 95%CI 1.04-1.09) and higher self-reported burnout (aOR 1.53, 95%CI 1.21-1.94). Overall satisfaction with the career (aOR 0.55, 95%CI 0.38-0.80), having a higher ratio of academic writing time (aOR 0.93, 95%CI 0.86-0.99), administrative time (aOR 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-0.99), or clinical time (aOR 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-0.99) were inversely associated with ever seriously considering leaving the specialty. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While older age is associated with ever seriously contemplating leaving the specialty, administrative and academic time appear to be protective in EM physicians and decrease the chances of ever serious consideration of leaving the specialty.

Underrepresentation of women in the senior levels of Brazilian science,Valentova J.V.; ; Otta E.; Silva M.L.; McElligott A.G.,"Despite significant progress, there is still a gender gap in science all over the world, especially at senior levels. Some progressive countries are recognizing the need to address barriers to gender equality in order to retain their best scientists and innovators, and ensure research excellence and social and economic returns on the investment made by taxpayers each year on training women scientists. We investigated the gender distribution of: (i) the productivity scholarship (PS) holders of the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, CNPq, N = 13,625), (ii) the members of the Brazilian Academy of Science (Academia Brasileira de Ciencias, ABC, N = 899), and (iii) the amount of funding awarded for top quality research (""Universal"" Call of CNPq, N = 3,836), between the years of 2013 and 2014. Our findings show evidence for gender imbalances in all the studied indicators of Brazilian science. We found that female scientists were more often represented among PS holders at the lower levels of the research ranking system (2). By contrast, male scientists were more often found at higher levels (1A and 1B) of PS holders, indicating the top scientific achievement, both in ""Engineering, Exact Sciences, Earth Sciences"", and ""Life Sciences"". This imbalance was not found in Humanities and Social Sciences. Only 14% of the ABC members were women. Humanities and Applied Social Sciences had a relatively low representation of women in the Academy (3.7%) compared to Engineering, Exact and Earth Sciences: 54.9% and Life Sciences: 41.4%. Finally, female scientists obtained significantly more funding at the lower level of the research ranking system (2), whereas male scientists obtained significantly more funding at the higher levels (1A and 1B).

Genome-wide association of endophenotypes for schizophrenia,Greenwood T.; ; Lazzeroni L.; Calkins M.; Freedman R.; Green M.; Gur R.; Light G.; Nuechterlein K.; Olincy A.; Radant A.; Seidman L.; Siever L.; Silverman J.; Stone W.; Sugar C.; Swerdlow N.; Tsuang D.; Tsuang M.; Turetsky B.; Braff D.,"Background: As part of the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS), we have previously reported the results of our efforts to characterize the genetic architecture of 12 endophenotypes for schizophrenia. We have previously reported substantial heritability for all endophenotypes in the COGS-1 family sample. Subsequent studies of these families implicated genomic regions of interest through candidate gene association and linkage methods, most of which converge on a single gene network related to glutamate signaling. Here we report our initial efforts to capture association for these same endophenotypes on a genomewide scale in the COGS-2 cohort of schizophrenia cases and controls. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A sample of 1352 schizophrenia cases and healthy control subjects, collected as part of phase 2 of COGS, was genotyped as part of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for the PsychChip. This array contains a 240,000 genome-wide marker grid, 240,000 exome markers, and 50,000 custom content markers for psychiatric illness and population ancestry and allows for accurate imputation of variants with minor allele frequencies of 1%. Standard quality control filters were applied, removing subjects for gender discrepancies, invariant markers and those with minor allele frequencies <0.01, and SNPs with call rates <0.98 or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p values <10-6 among controls. Ancestry was confirmed via comparison with the HapMap3 reference, and population outliers were removed. The two largest groups, reflecting European and Latino ancestry, were selected for further analysis. Each group was imputed separately to the 1000 genomes reference using the PGC pipeline, retaining only markers with high confidence scores. A final round of quality control filters were applied as above to each sample separately to generate final datasets including >6.2M variants with a total genotyping rate >0.99. The final datasets included 523 cases and 506 controls of European ancestry and 100 cases and 83 controls of Latino ancestry. Multidimensional scaling was used to calculate principal components for each dataset for use as covariates to correct for residual population stratification and genotype pool discrepancies. Association was performed using linear regression, adjusting for age and sex as needed, as well as the first five principal components. We evaluated all primary endophenotypes that overlap between COGS-1 and COGS-2. These include prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) at 60ms, antisaccade, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) trials 1-5 total correct responses, degraded stimulus Continuous Performance Test (DSCPT) discrimination (d'), and Letter-Number Span (LNS) correct reordering, as well as abstraction and mental flexibility (ABF), face memory (FMEM), spatial memory (SMEM), verbal memory (VMEM), spatial processing (SPA), sensori-motor dexterity (SM), and emotion recognition (EMO) from the University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. Association results from the European and Latino analyses were combined through metaanalysis, weighted for sample size. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Many independent regions exceeding a genomewide suggestive threshold of 10-5 were identified in the COGS-2 European case-control sample that were strengthened when combined with the results in the Latino casecontrol sample. Replication of the most prominent regions was assessed in 276 schizophrenia probands and 321 healthy control subjects of European ancestry from the COGS-1 families, who were also genotyped for the PsychChip and underwent identical analytic procedures. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These analyses have identified many genomic regions of interest that require further exploration and validation. We note that the case-control sample presented here represents only a portion of the complete COGS-2 sample, with 1034 additional COGS-2 subjects of African American ancestry and 1093 COGS-1 family members still pending genotyping. Whole genome sequencing is also pending for both the COGS-1 and COGS-2 samples that will allow for a deeper investigation of the genomic regions identified here though association. It is important to note that we are investigating the genetic architecture of heritable neurocognitive and neurophysiological endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia risk.

"Medical Students' Knowledge, Familiarity, and Attitudes towards Hematopoietic Stem Cell Donation: Stem Cell Donation Behaviors",Narayanan P.; ; Wolanskyj A.; Ehlers S.L.; Litzow M.R.; Patnaik M.S.; Hogan W.J.; Hashmi S.K.,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for patients with blood disorders and genetic diseases. Approximately 70% of the HSCTs currently performed in the United States use stems cells from an unrelated donor who donated voluntarily. Medical students (MS) are a young, diverse, influential population whose willingness to engage in altruistic acts, such as donating stem cells, may be correlated with knowledge on the topic. A literature gap exists in MS perspectives towards HSCT and the bone marrow registry (BMR) and prior studies suggest that misconceptions about donation deter MS from participation on the BMR, which may decrease opportunities to educate other potential donors. We performed a cross-sectional survey among the 4-year cohort of MS at Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minnesota. The questionnaire evaluated multiple areas including whether MS were current members of the BMR and/or prior blood donors, MS current knowledge on donor eligibility (DE) and the donation process (DP), MS familiarity with HSCT and the DP, and MS attitudes towards joining the BMR and towards donating stem cells. The responses were analyzed and assessed alongside a self-reported, standardized scale measuring students' altruistic behaviors. There were 99 out of 247 potential respondents (40%), with 45% (n = 44) of MS in preclinical years 1 or 2, 37% (n = 37) in clinical years 3 or 4, and 18% (n = 18) in research or alternative portions of their training, of which 43% (n = 41) in total were current BMR members. BMR status correlated positively with prior blood donation (P = .015) and female sex (P = .014). Respondents had a 57.7% and 63.7% average correct response rate regarding knowledge of DE and DP, respectively, with knowledge of DE not surprisingly higher in BMR members (P < .0001). The majority of MS surveyed, 68% (n = 65), had learned about HSCT during medical school. BMR status correlated with the following attitudes towards donating stem cells: lower concern with all evaluated aspects of HSCT-time, cost, pain, and side effects (for all subsections, P < .05) but not with the altruism score (P = .32). The mean altruism score for respondents was 59.9 +/- 11.3 (of a possible 100 points) with no significant difference in age, race, sex, level of training, or participation in the BMR. Altruism scores did not directly correlate with lower concern with aspects of time, cost, and pain of HSCT but did with long-term side effects (P = .021). This latter correlation was regardless of BMR status. Among MS, positive predictors for participation in the BMR included prior blood donation and female sex. BMR status did not ensure knowledge of all aspects of donating stem cells, but it correlated with less concern regarding the DP and was unrelated to altruism score. Improving knowledge gaps regarding the BMR and HSCT for the next generation of physicians and health care providers through expanded medical education curriculum may be beneficial to for the recruitment and retention of donor populations to the BMR.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation",2016,/,Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,22,9,1710EP  - 1716,612748640,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2016.06.014,27343721,#968,Narayanan 2016,"",""
Blood donation process in R. Macedonia in the period of 3 years (2013-2015),Blagoevska M.; ; Mitevska L.; Makarovska Bojadzieva T.; Velkova E.,"Background: R. Macedonia has 70 years tradition in blood donation. National Institute of Transfusion Medicine (NITM) is a unique public health care organization at national level, integrated as one institution since the year 2011, with the Institute of Transfusion Medicine in Skopje (ITM-Skopje), 3 Regional Centers (RC) and 18 Blood Transfusion Services (BTSs) all over the country. NITM provide blood and blood components for public and private healthcare organizations. With its 2 million citizens, the country has reached self-sufficiency in red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, but immunoglobulin, albumin and coagulation factors are still importing. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To analyze the blood donor's structure at NITM, by different demographic characteristics: men/women, voluntary/family donors, pupils/students, deferred donors, in order to estimate is there a need for targeted activities for recruitment of new donors and retention of regular ones. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study was used to evaluate data from the registry of blood donations at national level, for the period of 3 years (2013-2015). Were analyzed different categories: total number of donations by BTSs, number of donations from voluntary and family blood donors, pupils (17-18 years old) and university students, first time and regular donors, as well as deferred donations with reasons for deferral. <ovid:br/>Result(s): During the 3 years period were collected 153.984 blood units, with the biggest number of collection in the year 2013 (54.018). At mobile sites were collected 83.910 units (54.5%), while at BTS 70.074 units (45.5%), mainly from voluntary donors (152.800, 99.2%) vs family donors (1,284, 0.8%). Men donated more often blood than women (126.159 units, 81.9% vs 27.825 units, 18.1%). Total number of deferred donors is 18.029 (11.9% in 2013, 12.3% in 2014 and 10.7% in 2015), which represent 10.5% of all registered donations. Pupil's donations represent 10.1% of all donations vs students 6.5% donations in total. The temporary deferred donations were 4,542 (82.6%). The most often reasons for deferral were: low hemoglobin level (31% for women and 24.6% for men), infections (11.2%), hypotension (9.3%), hypertension (9%) etc. for the analyzed period. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There are significant discrepancies between men vs women donations; number of donations among university student's population is lower that among high school pupils, that can be accepted as a negative indicator in blood donor recruitment and a challenge for future activities. The blood donor population is getting old, which confirms the results of this study. In R.

Considering the role of sex and gender in biomedical research,Geller S.; ,"Despite some advances in gender equality in the biomedical sciences, significant inequalities persist in two general areas. Not only are biological sex and gender insufficiently reported within research studies, but women are also underrepresented as basic and clinical researchers in academic medicine. While these issues may seem unrelated, addressing both will diversify knowledge and interdisciplinary research teams, as well as improve the value of the science produced and ultimately the quality of health care provided. In 1986, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) instituted a policy urging the inclusion of women as subjects in clinical trials. This policy was made into law when Congress passed the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, which requires that NIH-supported clinical research include women and minorities as subjects. {National Institutes of Health, 1994 #901} The Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH), with the NIH Office of Extramural Research and Office of Intramural Research, has played a critical role in funding basic research and clinical trials to study women's health and explore the role of sex and gender differences in health outcomes. Despite these initiatives, evidence suggests that sex is still not sufficiently considered as a biologic variable in federally funded research, and studies oftentimes fail to account for the cultural and societal influences of gender in health outcomes. In 2007, women comprised 61.8% of clinical trial participants, yet 75% of federally funded studies published in 2009 failed to report any outcomes by sex/gender. Recent events, such as the FDA's updated Ambien dosage recommendation for men versus women, demonstrate the harmful effects of failing to account for sex as a biologic variable. In recognition of the slow progress, the NIH required that research grants submitted after January 25, 2016, address biologic sex within their research design and added reviewer criteria related to its inclusion. Ensuring enhanced inclusion, analysis, and reporting of sex and gender goes beyond NIH policy, also entailing the efforts of NIH to enforce requirements, journal editors to add review criteria related to sex and gender, and researchers themselves. In addition, increasing consideration of sex and gender requires expanding the proportion of women leading research programs. Latest data from AAMC (2013-2014) shows that although 47% of medical school students are female, only 21% of full professors, 15% of department chairs, and 16% of U.S. Medical School Deans are women. Studies have found that gender diversity within academic research teams improves research quality. The ORWH has implemented various programs to diversify the sciences; however, change has been less than desired. Studies indicate that females have lower publication rates throughout their careers, and are less likely to receive an R01 than men, despite reporting equal likelihood of applying for R01 awards. Additionally, the intra-organizational and network reach of female scientists is smaller than that of men, hindering opportunities for collaboration and publication. Even in the instance of equally qualified men and women conducting comparable work, studies find differential pay between male and female researchers as well as promotion to leadership positions. These factors, both in part caused by and in part exasperated by unconscious interpersonal and institutional biases, lead to higher female attrition within the sciences and academia. Addressing disparities and promoting greater inclusion includes focusing on unconscious bias and putting greater efforts toward mentoring and leadership initiatives for women. Only by partnering efforts to increase inclusion of sex/gender within research design with efforts to diversify the biomedical workforce can we adequately consider the role of sex and gender in biomedical research.",2016,/,Menopause,23,12,1368,615008814,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000000783,,#970,Geller 2016,"",""
The impact of self-esteem on career advancement among women and underrepresented minorities in academic medicine,Manne-Goehler J.M.; ; Freund K.; Raj A.; Kaplan S.E.; Terrin N.; Breeze J.L.; Carr P.,"BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to advance gender equality among physicians, differential career outcomes by gender persist in academic medicine. One factor unexplored as a reason for gender differences in career outcomes is the impact of self-esteem on physician outcomes. This is the first study to quantify the impact of self-esteem on subsequent key metrics of career achievement in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The National Faculty Study (NFS) is a longitudinal survey of career outcomes among female and male faculty, across the United States. The first National Faculty Survey was conducted in 1995 among a stratified random sample of 1814 faculty members, over sampling among women and minority faculty, at 24 medical schools. In 2012-13, we conducted a longitudinal follow-up among the sub-sample willing to participate in follow up studies. In the original survey, self-esteem was measured by the 4 item Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which was normalized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1.0 for these analyses. The follow up survey inquired about four major domains of career achievement: 1) number of peer-reviewed publications as a measure academic productivity, 2) academic rank of full Professor, 3) senior leadership including dean and department chair and 4) retention in an academic career. For non-respondents to the follow up survey, we supplemented our database from publically available sources. We assessed the impact of self-esteem in 1995 on career outcomes in 2012-13 in bivariate analyses, and then in multivariate regression models. We utilized logistic regression for all analyses except that of refereed publications, for which a negative binomial model was utilized. All multivariate models included gender and race/ethnicity (dichotomized as white versus minority, both underrepresented and non-underrepresented), and used backward selection for the following additional potential covariates: specialty, effort distribution across domains of teaching, clinical, research and administration, and years since first appointment. Because we hypothesized that gender differences in outcomes may be related to self- esteem, we repeated the analyses with interaction terms between gender and self-esteem. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The analytic sample was 1235, of whom 50 % were women and 71%were white. The mean self-esteem score in 1995 was significantly lower for women (-.119) than men (+.118, p < .0001). In unadjusted models, higher self-esteem in 1995 was positively associated with attaining the rank of Professor (odds ratio (OR) 1.36; 95 % confidence interval (CI, 1.20, 1.55), senior leadership (OR 1.28; CI 1.09, 1.50), number of peer-reviewed publications (OR 1.17; CI 1.10, 1.25), and retention (OR 1.29; CI 1.11, 1.50) in academic medicine. In multivariate regression models, female gender and minority race / ethnicity were negatively associated with all outcomes. In the multivariate models adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity, self-esteem retained its independent positive association with rank (OR 1.22; CI 1.05, 1.55), leadership (OR 1.22; CI 1.04, 1.43), refereed publications (RR 1.11; CI 1.04, 1.18), and retention (OR 1.31; CI 1.12, 1.53). There were no significant interactions between gender and self- esteem for any of the career outcomes. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Women reported lower self-esteem as compared to men in 1995. While higher self-esteem had a positive association with subsequent outcomes of retention, referred publications, rank and leadership, there was no confounding of this association by gender or race/ ethnicity and there was no significant interaction between selfesteem and gender. This indicates that the impact of self-esteem on career advancement was similar for women and men and for majority and underrepresented minority faculty, even though membership in these groups was associated with decreased odds of career advancement as measured by the metrics above. While self-esteem appears to be important for career advancement, it does not explain gaps in career advancement for women or minority faculty.",2016,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,31,2 SUPPL. 1,S424EP  - S425,72288753,,,#971,Manne-Goehler 2016,"",""
Reducing Implicit Gender Leadership Bias in Academic Medicine With an Educational Intervention,Girod S.; ; Fassiotto M.; Grewal D.; Ku M.C.; Sriram N.; Nosek B.A.; Valantine H.,"PURPOSE: One challenge academic health centers face is to advance female faculty to leadership positions and retain them there in numbers equal to men, especially given the equal representation of women and men among graduates of medicine and biological sciences over the last 10 years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the explicit and implicit biases favoring men as leaders, among both men and women faculty, and to assess whether these attitudes change following an educational intervention., METHOD: The authors used a standardized, 20-minute educational intervention to educate faculty about implicit biases and strategies for overcoming them. Next, they assessed the effect of this intervention. From March 2012 through April 2013, 281 faculty members participated in the intervention across 13 of 18 clinical departments., RESULTS: The study assessed faculty members' perceptions of bias as well as their explicit and implicit attitudes toward gender and leadership. Results indicated that the intervention significantly changed all faculty members' perceptions of bias (P < .05 across all eight measures). Although, as expected, explicit biases did not change following the intervention, the intervention did have a small but significant positive effect on the implicit biases surrounding women and leadership of all participants regardless of age or gender (P = .008)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that providing education on bias and strategies for reducing it can serve as an important step toward reducing gender bias in academic medicine and, ultimately, promoting institutional change, specifically the promoting of women to higher ranks.",2016,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,91,8,1143EP  - 1150,617359286,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000001099,26826068,#972,Girod 2016,"",""
The gendered realities and talent management imperatives of women physicians,Hoff T.; ; Scott S.,"INTRODUCTION: U.S. medicine is increasingly a gender-balanced profession with half of all medical school graduates now female. Despite this reality and the potentially transformative nature of a large female physician cohort in U.S. health care, there is less examination of their workplace realities and the key talent management strategies for health care organizations employing women physicians., PURPOSE: First, we identify current knowledge about U.S. women physician satisfaction, role challenges, and work tradeoffs. Gender theory is used to help interpret these workplace realities. Second, we use this information to identify talent management strategies health care organizations might consider to mitigate the realities and provide greater support for women physicians., METHODS: To facilitate our analysis, we conducted a narrative review of published research that includes analysis focused on U.S. women physicians for the time period 2006-2014. Applying ideas from gender theory, we extrapolated key findings from that research related to three issues: satisfaction, role challenges, and tradeoffs. Then we synthesized the findings to identify general talent management strategies that could address these dynamics proactively while enhancing recruitment and retention with respect to women physicians., FINDINGS: U.S. women physicians express strong levels of satisfaction, particularly with their careers, at the same time they continue to experience gender-based inequities, role challenges, and lack of work-life balance in their chosen specialty fields. Lack of suitable role models and appropriate mentoring for women physicians, in addition to barriers to career advancement, are also prevalent across different medical specialties., CONCLUSION: Similar to other occupations and industries, gender-based inequities and role strains are very real issues for women physicians. Health care organizations must acknowledge these issues and employ effective talent management strategies aimed at women doctors if they are to be viewed as an employer of choice by this increasingly important occupational cohort.",2016,/,Health care management review,41,3,189EP  - 199,620350128,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000069,25978004,#973,Hoff 2016,"",""

Broadening Participation in the Life Sciences with Social-Psychological Interventions,Tibbetts Y.; ; Harackiewicz J.M.; Priniski S.J.; Canning E.A.,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have recently documented the positive effects of social-psychological interventions on the performance and retention of underrepresented students in the life sciences. We review two types of social-psychological interventions that address either students' well-being in college science courses or students' engagement in science content. Interventions that have proven effective in RCTs in science courses (namely, utility-value [UV] and values-affirmation [VA] interventions) emphasize different types of student values-students' perceptions of the value of curricular content and students' personal values that shape their educational experiences. Both types of value can be leveraged to promote positive academic outcomes for underrepresented students. For example, recent work shows that brief writing interventions embedded in the curriculum can increase students' perceptions of UV (the perceived importance or usefulness of a task for future goals) and dramatically improve the performance of first-generation (FG) underrepresented minority students in college biology. Other work has emphasized students' personal values in brief essays written early in the semester. This VA intervention has been shown to close achievement gaps for women in physics classes and for FG students in college biology. By reviewing recent research, considering which interventions are most effective for different groups, and examining the causal mechanisms driving these positive effects, we hope to inform life sciences educators about the potential of social-psychological interventions for broadening participation in the life sciences.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Y.

Can today's house officers teach effectively? An assessment in undergraduate emergency training,Iblher P.; ; Zupanic M.; Karsten J.; Brauer K.,"Background Previous publications describe house officers (HOs) as unaware of their ineffective teaching skills. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of teaching seniority in the comparison of teaching skills between HOs and faculty. Materials and methods Ten HOs (F: n=4, M: n=6, age: 35.1+/-6.8 years) and nine faculty (F: n=3, M: n=6, age: 41.4+/-4.9 years) who actively teach undergraduate emergency medicine were immediately evaluated at the end of the course by their students using the questionnaire SFDP26. The questionnaire consists of one item on 'overall teaching effectiveness' (OTE) (1=very poor to 5=excellent) and 25 items measured on a five-point Likert scale (1-5=strongly disagree to strongly agree) divided into seven subscales: 1, 'establishing the learning climate' (LC); 2, 'control of session' (CS); 3, 'communication of goals' (CG); 4, 'facilitating understanding and retention' (UR); 5, 'evaluation' (E); 6, 'feedback' (FB) and 7, 'promoting self-directed learning' (SL). The sample included 173 medical students in their third year of training who were randomly assigned to the instructors. A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to calculate group-related differences (resident vs. teaching faculty). For significant differences, effect size was calculated (r=Z/N). Results No sex-related differences were found. Significantly better ratings for HOs were found in subscales: 1, 'LC' (P=0.001; r=0.20); 2, 'CS' (P=0.037; r=0.15); 5, 'E' (P=0.007; r=0.20); 6, 'FB' (P=0.001; r=0.23); 7, 'SL' (P=0.004; r=0.24) and 'OTE' (P=0.027; r=0.26). Conclusion From a learner's perspective, the quality of teaching provided by HOs was rated at least similar and mostly better overall than that provided by faculty. These findings contradict results from previous studies on the quality of HO teaching and therefore warrant further assessment.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Gender in science and engineering faculties: Demographic inertia revisited,Thomas N.R.; ; Poole D.J.; Herbers J.M.,"The under-representation of women on faculties of science and engineering is ascribed in part to demographic inertia, which is the lag between retirement of current faculty and future hires. The assumption of demographic inertia implies that, given enough time, gender parity will be achieved. We examine that assumption via a semi-Markov model to predict the future faculty, with simulations that predict the convergence demographic state. Our model shows that existing practices that produce gender gaps in recruitment, retention, and career progression preclude eventual gender parity. Further, we examine sensitivity of the convergence state to current gender gaps to show that all sources of disparity across the entire faculty career must be erased to produce parity: we cannot blame demographic inertia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Thomas et al This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",2015,/,PLoS ONE,10,10,e0139767,607159426,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139767,26488899,#977,Thomas 2015,"",""

Discrepancies in the female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeon workforce,Muffly T.M.; ; Weterings R.; Barber M.D.; Steinberg A.C.,"Introduction It is unclear whether the current distribution of surgeons practicing female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery in the United States is adequate to meet the needs of a growing and aging population. We assessed the geographic distribution of female pelvic surgeons as represented by members of the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) throughout the United States at the county, state, and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists district levels. Materials and Methods County-level data from the AUGS, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the United States Census were analyzed in this observational study. State and national patterns of female pelvic surgeon density were mapped graphically using ArcGIS software and 2010 US Census demographic data. Results In 2013, the 1058 AUGS practicing physicians represented 0.13% of the total physician workforce. There were 6.7 AUGS members available for every 1 million women and 20 AUGS members for every 1 million postreproductive-aged women in the United States. The density of female pelvic surgeons was highest in metropolitan areas. Overall, 88% of the counties in the United States lacked female pelvic surgeons. Nationwide, there was a mean of 1 AUGS member for every 31 practicing general obstetrician-gynecologists.

Establishing a knee preservation registry to follow patients with degenerative joint disease,Szulc A.; ; Murphy H.; Nathasingh C.K.; Lee E.; Payne A.; Inneh I.; Wisniewski H.-G.; Iorio R.; Jazrawi L.; Slover J.; Samuels J.; Strauss E.J.; Band P.A.,"Purpose: The Joint Preservation Registry (JPR) is a prospective, pragmatic, observational study, designed to identify clinical and biochemicalmarkers of osteoarthritis (OA) phenotype, status and progression. Because the time course of degenerative joint disease is highly variable, the optimal treatment for an individual patient is clinically determined by multiple factors, and highly variable between both clinicians and patients. Few large data sets are available studying the ways that clinicians and patients handle this uncertainty, particularly with respect to the timing of surgical intervention. To address this gap in knowledge, the JPR was established to follow consenting patients who present with knee symptoms to physicians at the center for musculoskeletal care of a large tertiary care medical center. The JPR also is intended to evaluate whether synovial fluid biomarkers previously found to be predictive of radiologic progression and knee replacementover a 3-year period, are alsopredictive of pain score progression over shorter time periods, and useful for optimizing treatment pathways. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Patients presenting with knee-related complaints were recruited into a Knee Preservation Registry, asked to consent to regular follow-up by email or phone every 6-12 months, and to allow any biospecimens collected during the course of their standard care to be retained in a bio-repository for future analyses. Participating investigators included both physicians and surgeons from the divisions of Sports Medicine, Rheumatology, and Adult Reconstruction. Inclusion criteria were deliberately broad to enable a diverse patient population, ranging from recent acute injury to advanced degenerative disease, and including patients with comorbidities. The registry is observational and captures demographics, medical history, anthropometrics, diagnosis codes, treatments, imaging, and patient-reported outcome (PRO), with much of the data directly retrieved from the medical record. Synovial fluid (SF) biomarker analysis and PRO score collection at regular followup are the only study-related procedures. Patients will be followed for 5 years from the time of enrollment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From September 2012 to July 2014, 813 patients (M = 340, F = 473) were recruited for the registry. The average age at enrollment was 52.3 years. SF was aspirated from 167 subjects (225 knees, 57 bilateral, 111 unilateral), for a total of 302 unique SF samples in the current biorepository which represents 21% of the total population that was sampled. The same percentage of patients with effusion was noted to be the same (21%) among men and women. Distribution of diagnoses, defined by ICD-9, was 72% for osteoarthritis (OA), 10% for acute injuries, and 18% for other non-OA complaints. Approximately half of the enrolled patients have reached the 6-12 month follow-up. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first pragmatic registry for knee OA patients that are not scheduled for knee replacement. The information captured by our registry can be used to study disease phenotypes as they relate to treatment alternatives, including ethnic, racial, socioeconomic and gender disparities. Ultimately we hope to establish evidence-based treatment pathways using a combination of biomarkers, PRO scores and advanced imaging to customize the treatment of OA to individual patient needs and preferences, and to assist surgeons in determining the appropriate timing for joint replacement.",2015,/,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,23,SUPPL. 2,A88,71906685,,,#983,Szulc 2015,"",""

Gender gaps in achievement and participation in multiple introductory biology classrooms,Eddy S.L.; ; Brownell S.E.; Wenderoth M.P.,"Although gender gaps have been a major concern in male-dominated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines such as physics and engineering, the numerical dominance of female students in biology has supported the assumption that gender disparities do not exist at the undergraduate level in life sciences. Using data from 23 large introductory biology classes for majors, we examine two measures of gender disparity in biology: academic achievement and participation in whole-class discussions. We found that females consistently underperform on exams compared with males with similar overall college grade point averages. In addition, although females on average represent 60% of the students in these courses, their voices make up less than 40% of those heard responding to instructor-posed questions to the class, one of the most common ways of engaging students in large lectures. Based on these data, we propose that, despite numerical dominance of females, gender disparities remain an issue in introductory biology classrooms. For student retention and achievement in biology to be truly merit based, we need to develop strategies to equalize the opportunities for students of different genders to practice the skills they need to excel.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 S.

Excess gestational weight gain and its long term health impact-Public health burden and policy,Mamun A.; ,"Background: Gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with postpartum weight retention (PPWR) in women. However, the strength of the association between GWG and long-term PPWR and obesity and its public health burden and health policies are still unclear. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We have conducted three sets of analyses. Firstly, publications from different databases were systematically extracted and the articles relevant to this study were reviewed to quantify the effect estimate of GWG on PPWR and BMI using a bias-adjusted method. The Institute of Medicine categories of ""inadequate,"" ""adequate,"" and ""excess"" were used to define GWG. The time span for PPWR was divided into three periods (<1 year, 1-9 years, and >=15 years) to determine outcome at different times postpartum. Secondly, we have analyzed 27y PPWR data of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) cohort (N = 2000) considering potential confounders and mediators. Finally, implications of the findings in recent health policy are critically examined. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Meta analyses of 12 studies showed that women with an inadequate GWG had a significantly lower mean PPWR of -2.14 kg (95%CI, -2.61 to -1.66) than women with an adequate GWG, who had a mean PPWR of 3.15 kg (95%CI, 2.47-3.82) up to 21 years postpartum. Over the postpartum time span, a U-shaped relationship was observed between the weighted mean difference calculated for women with excess GWG and the weighted mean difference calculated for women with adequate GWG, and this relationship was time independent between these two groups. MUSP 27y post-partum data showed that women who gained excess GWG they were at 4.5 times higher risk to become obese after 27 year post-partum compared to the women who gained adequate GWG. Implications of these findings in recent health policy changes will be discussed. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings of this study suggest that GWG outside of the Institute of Medicine recommendations can lead to both short-term and long-term postpartum weight imbalance.",2014,/,Obesity Research and Clinical Practice,8,SUPPL. 1,62,71741331,https://dx.doi.org/org/10.1016/j.orcp.2014.10.115,,#987,Mamun 2014,"",""
Mentoring and the career satisfaction of male and female academic medical faculty,Decastro R.; ; Griffith K.A.; Ubel P.A.; Stewart A.; Jagsi R.,"Purpose: To explore aspects of mentoring that might influence medical faculty career satisfaction and to discover whether there are gender differences. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In 2010-2011, the authors surveyed 1,708 clinician-researchers who received (in 2006-2009) National Institutes of Health K08 and K23 awards, which provided mentoring for career development. The authors compared, by gender, the development and nature of mentoring relationships, mentor characteristics, extent of mentoring in various mentor roles, and satisfaction with mentoring. They evaluated associations between mentoring and career satisfaction using multivariable linear regression analysis. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The authors received 1,275 responses (75% response rate).

Degeneration and destruction for femoral articular cartilage is preceded than those for confronting tibial and patellar articular cartilage in early stage of knee osteoarthritis: A cross-sectional study,Hada S.; ; Kaneko H.; Sadatsuki R.; Liz L.; Yusup A.; Kinoshita M.; Futami I.; Shimura Y.; Tsuchiya M.; Saita Y.; Takazawa Y.; Ikeda H.; Kaneko K.; Ishijima M.,"Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slowly but progressively degenerative joint disease, which is characterized by cartilage degeneration, attrition by the loss of cartilage, subchondral sclerosis, and degradation of the meniscus and bone marrow abnormality. In the initial stage of knee OA, OA changes are started in a molecular level of the articular cartilage, such as loss of proteoglycan, increased water content, and disorganization of the collagen network, probably before a morphologic change of the articular cartilage. The morphologic changes can be visualized and semi-quantified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS), respectively. T2 mapping sequence on MRI is a technique that is sensitive to detect the early biochemical changes of water content and the disorganization of the collagen network in articular cartilage. These techniques enable us to understand a very early stage of knee OA. It is still remained unclear whether OA-induced qualitative and morphological changes of articular cartilage are simultaneously and equally occurred in the confronting femoral and tibial articular cartilage in both tibio-femoral joint (TFJ) and patello-femoral joint (PFJ). The aim of the present study was to figure out this question by qualitatively and morphologically evaluating the OA-induced articular cartilage changes using T2 mapping and WORMS technique. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 50 patients (mean age 59.7 years) who consulted our out-patient clinic for knee pain between May and December 2012 were enrolled in this study. The severity of knee OA was classified by Kellgren- Lawrence (K/L) grading scale based on standing extended-knee Xray images. All patients showed either K/L grade 0,1 or 2, and were also performed 3TMRI for the affected knee. Diagnosis of knee OA for the subjects with K/L 0 was conducted using 3TMRI according to the method by Shama et al (ARD 2013). Patients who showed less than 174degreeof femorotibial tibial angle (FTA) were excluded from the study. T2 mapping were calculated from a five multi-echo, spin-echo (MESE) sequence (TR = 1000ms TE = 13.8, 27.6, 41.4, 55.2, 69 ms matrix = 384x384, scantime = 3:30). Compartments of the knee joint was divided into 14 places of areas according to WORMS using sagittal and coronal two dimensional (2D) fat suppressed and T2 weighted image fast spin-echo sequence(TR = 5000ms, TE = 70ms, FOV 160mm, matrix = 384x307, Slice thickness = 3mm, turbo-factor = 17, Flip-angle = 150, scan time = 3:00. Subjects were evaluated the spatial difference about femoral condyle (FC) and tibial plateau articular surface (TP) in the TFJ and also patellar (P) and femoral groove articular surface (G) in the PFJ based on the comparison of T2 value and WORMS scores of each part. Non parametric analysis was used for the statistics method. <ovid:br/>Result(s): This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of our university. Radiographic OA severities of the patients were K/L grade 0; 3, K/L grade 1; 27, K/L grade 2; 20. Twenty-three of fifty patients were male, while remaining twenty-seven patients were female. No significant differences of FTA were observed between the patients with three different K/L grades. T2 values of the femoral cartilage were significantly higher than those of the confronting tibial cartilage of the patients with early stage of knee OA (p < 0.001) [Odds ratio (OR: OR of T2 values in femoral cartilage was higher than that of tibial cartilage): infinity, p < 0.001]. T2 values of the femoral cartilage were significantly higher than those of the confronting patellar cartilage of the patients (p < 0.001) [OR: infinity, p < 0.001]. WORMS cartilage score of the femur were significantly higher than those of both the confronting tibia and patella of the patients with early stage of knee OA [TFJ: p < 0.001, OR: 4.8 (95% CI: 2.2-10.4), p < 0.001][PFJ: p < 0.01,OR: 3.0 (95% CI:1.5-6.1), p < 0.01].WORMS osteophyte scores of the femur were significantly higher than those of both the confronting tibia and patella of the patients with early stage of knee OA [TFJ: p < 0.001, OR: 4.1 (95% CI: 1.9-8.9), p < 0.001][PFJ: p = 0.011,OR: 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0), p < 0.01]. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The current study clearly reveals that OA-induced femoral qualitative and morphological changes of articular cartilage does not proceed simultaneously and equally in comparison to those of the confronting tibial and patellar articular cartilage in both tibio-femoral joint (TFJ) and patello-femoral joint (PFJ), respectively.",2014,/,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,22,SUPPL. 1,S277EP  - S278,71464248,,,#989,Hada 2014,"",""
