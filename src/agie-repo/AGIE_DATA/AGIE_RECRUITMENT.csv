Recruiting Young People for Digital Mental Health Research: Lessons From an AI-Driven Adaptive Trial.,Zheng WY; Shvetcov A; Slade A; Jenkins Z; Hoon L; Whitton A; Logothetis R; Ravindra S; Kurniawan S; Gupta S; Huckvale K; Stech E; Agarwal A; Funke Kupper J; Cameron S; Rosenberg J; Manoglou N; Senadeera M; Venkatesh S; Mouzakis K; Vasa R; Christensen H; Newby JM,"BACKGROUND: With increasing adoption of remote clinical trials in digital mental health, identifying cost-effective and time-efficient recruitment methodologies is crucial for the success of such trials. Evidence on whether web-based recruitment methods are more effective than traditional methods such as newspapers, media, or flyers is inconsistent. Here we present insights from our experience recruiting tertiary education students for a digital mental health artificial intelligence-driven adaptive trial-Vibe Up. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of recruitment via Facebook and Instagram compared to traditional methods for a treatment trial and compared different recruitment methods' retention rates. With recruitment coinciding with COVID-19 lockdowns across Australia, we also compared the cost-effectiveness of social media recruitment during and after lockdowns. METHODS: Recruitment was completed for 2 pilot trials and 6 minitrials from June 2021 to May 2022. To recruit participants, paid social media advertising on Facebook and Instagram was used, alongside mailing lists of university networks and student organizations or services, media releases, announcements during classes and events, study posters or flyers on university campuses, and health professional networks. Recruitment data, including engagement metrics collected by Meta (Facebook and Instagram), advertising costs, and Qualtrics data on recruitment methods and survey completion rates, were analyzed using RStudio with R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). RESULTS: In total, 1314 eligible participants (aged 22.79, SD 4.71 years; 1079, 82.1% female) were recruited to 2 pilot trials and 6 minitrials. The vast majority were recruited via Facebook and Instagram advertising (n=1203; 92%). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the lead institution's website was more effective in recruiting eligible participants than Facebook (z=3.47; P=.003) and Instagram (z=4.23; P<.001). No differences were found between recruitment methods in retaining participants at baseline, at midpoint, and at study completion. Wilcoxon tests found significant differences between lockdown (pilot 1 and pilot 2) and postlockdown (minitrials 1-6) on costs incurred per link click (lockdown: median Aus $0.35 [US $0.22], IQR Aus $0.27-$0.47 [US $0.17-$0.29]; postlockdown: median Aus $1.00 [US $0.62], IQR Aus $0.70-$1.47 [US $0.44-$0.92]; W=9087; P<.001) and the amount spent per hour to reach the target sample size (lockdown: median Aus $4.75 [US $2.95], IQR Aus $1.94-6.34 [US $1.22-$3.97]; postlockdown: median Aus $13.29 [US $8.26], IQR Aus $4.70-25.31 [US $2.95-$15.87]; W=16044; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Social media advertising via Facebook and Instagram was the most successful strategy for recruiting distressed tertiary students into this artificial intelligence-driven adaptive trial, providing evidence for the use of this recruitment method for this type of trial in digital mental health research. No recruitment method stood out in terms of participant retention. Perhaps a reflection of the added distress experienced by young people, social media recruitment during the COVID-19 lockdown period was more cost-effective.

Recruitment Strategies To Improve Gender Equity in Clinical and Translational Research Training in Ethiopia.,Hoover AT; Woldeamanuel Y; Wassie L; Eyob H; Haile Mariam D; Kempker RR; Blumberg HM; Comeau DL; Bobosha K,"Women from sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, are underrepresented in biomedical research due in part to limited access to high-quality research training and mentorship. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Ethiopia, with a limited number of female Ethiopian scientists engaged in TB-related research. To improve access to TB-related research training among junior women scientists, our NIH Fogarty International Center-funded D43 program released an all-women request for applications (RFA), which substantially increased the number of women applying for research training and the number of women trained in our program. The impact of the all-women cohort was also bolstered by prominent female representation in mentor teams, program leadership, and program alumnae. Sustained increases in applications from women were seen in subsequent RFAs that included both women and men. Targeted leadership, mentorship, and recruitment efforts were effective in promoting improved gender equity in biomedical research training.",2025,Jan,Am J Trop Med Hyg,112,1,13-16,,10.4269/ajtmh.24-0120,39406208,#2,Hoover 2025,"",""
Strategies to improve recruitment in mental health clinical trials: a scoping review (RE-MIND study).,Iflaifel M; Hall CL; Green HR; Willis A; Rennick-Egglestone S; Juszczak E; Townsend M; Martin J; Sprange K,"BACKGROUND: Lower-than-expected recruitment continues to be one of the major causes of trial delays, and trials to improve mental health are no exception. Indeed, recruitment challenges in trials of vulnerable populations, such as those living with mental health illness, can even be exacerbated. To address this, researchers are turning to digital and online recruitment strategies, e.g. web-based approaches and multi-media in order to (1) increase recruitment efficiency (recruit to target and on time) and (2) improve diversity in mental health clinical trials to be more inclusive and reduce health inequity. There is, however, inconclusive evidence on the success of digital and online recruitment strategies in mental health clinical trials. The RE-MIND study comprised a scoping review to assess the impact of using such recruitment strategies in mental health clinical trials to inform a more systematic scoping review. METHODS: A cohort of 191 recently published RCTs and randomised feasibility studies were identified from the NIHR Journals Library and top two mental health journals (based on citation metrics), Lancet Psychiatry and JAMA Psychiatry. Population characteristics including gender, ethnicity and age were summarised for inclusivity using descriptive statistics, and recruitment strategies were compared to examine differences in their success in recruiting to target. RESULTS: After screening, 97 articles were included for review. The review findings showed no evidence that offline or mixed strategies were superior for achieving recruitment targets in mental health trials. However, there was a suggestion that trials using a mixed recruitment strategy improved inclusivity and tended to recruit closer to the target. CONCLUSIONS: The key finding was that consideration should be given to a mixed methods approach to recruitment not only to enable wider and more diverse participation in mental health trials but also to realize greater efficiency.",2024,Dec,Trials,25,1,832,,10.1186/s13063-024-08665-x,39695709,#3,Iflaifel 2024,"",""
Recruitment of Adolescents to Virtual Clinical Trials: Recruitment Results From the Health4Me Randomized Controlled Trial.,Raeside R; Todd AR; Barakat S; Rom S; Boulet S; Maguire S; Williams K; Mihrshahi S; Hackett ML; Redfern J; Partridge SR,"BACKGROUND: Preventive interventions are needed to provide targeted health support to adolescents to improve health behaviors. Engaging adolescents in preventive interventions remains a challenge, highlighting the need for innovative recruitment strategies. Given adolescents' lives are intertwined with digital technologies, attention should be focused on these avenues for recruitment. The evolving nature of clinical trials, including the emergence of virtual clinical trials, requires new recruitment approaches, which must be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness and cost of various digital recruitment strategies for recruiting adolescents to a virtual clinical trial, evaluate the progression of participants from screening to enrollment, and explore factors associated with nonparticipation. This was conducted using data from the Health4Me Study, a preventive digital health intervention to improve physical activity and nutrition behaviors among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. METHODS: Participants were recruited into the Health4Me Study via social media advertisements on various contemporary platforms, emails to schools, emails to contacts within known networks, and emails to relevant youth organizations. Data were collected from social media advertisements, screening, and recruitment logs. Data analysis included summary and descriptive statistics, as well as chi-square tests to explore factors associated with nonparticipation. RESULTS: From 2369 expressions of interest, 390 (16.4%) participants were enrolled. A total of 19 advertisements were placed on social media, and 385 promotional emails were sent to schools, contacts within known networks, and relevant youth organizations. Social media advertisements reached 408,077 unique accounts. Advertisements mostly reached those living in populous states in Australia (306,489/408,077, 75.11% of unique accounts) and those identifying as female (177,698/408,077, 43.55% of unique accounts). A total of 24.97% (101,907/408,077) of advertisements were delivered to accounts with uncategorized genders. The total cost per participant enrolled was Aus $3.89 (approximately US $2.58). Most participants (1980/2305, 85.90%) found out about this study through Instagram. Differences in screening characteristics between eligible participants who did and did not enroll were found to be statistically significant for gender (P=.02), with fewer males and more individuals reporting their gender as ""other"" enrolling than expected by chance alone. The recruitment method also differed (P<.001), with fewer participants enrolling through Instagram and more enrolling through other methods (eg, known networks or word of mouth) than expected by chance alone. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that virtual clinical trial recruitment was found to be low-cost, with the potential to increase trial participation. Social media was the most effective recruitment method, reaching all states and territories, including hard-to-reach populations. Future action is needed to explore recruitment methods that are more effective for males and to build trust among adolescents regarding clinical trial recruitment via social media.",2024,Dec,JMIR Pediatr Parent,7,,e62919,,10.2196/62919,39807764,#4,Raeside 2024,"",""
The effects of resistance training to near volitional failure on motor unit recruitment during neuromuscular fatigue.,Beausejour JP; Knowles KS; Pagan JI; Rodriguez JP; Sheldon D; Ruple BA; Plotkin DL; Smith MA; Godwin JS; Sexton CL; McIntosh MC; Kontos NJ; Libardi CA; Young K; Roberts MD; Stock MS,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether chronically training close to volitional failure influences motor unit recruitment strategies during fatigue. PURPOSE: We compared resistance training to near volitional failure vs. non-failure on individual motor unit action potential amplitude (MUAP) and surface electromyographic excitation (sEMG) during fatiguing contractions. METHODS: Nineteen resistance-trained adults (11 males, 8 females) underwent 5 weeks (3×/week) of either low repetitions-in-reserve (RIR; 0-1 RIR) or high RIR training (4-6 RIR). Before and after the intervention, participants performed isometric contractions of the knee extensors at 30% of maximal peak torque until exhaustion while vastus lateralis sEMG signals were recorded and later decomposed. MUAP and sEMG excitation for the vastus lateralis were quantified at the beginning, middle, and end of the fatigue assessment. RESULTS: Both training groups improved time-to-task failure (mean change = 43.3 s, 24.0%), with no significant differences between low and high RIR training groups (low RIR = 28.7%, high RIR = 19.4%). Our fatigue assessment revealed reduced isometric torque steadiness and increased MUAP amplitude and sEMG excitation during the fatiguing task, but these changes were consistent between groups. CONCLUSION: Both low and high RIR training improved time-to-task failure, but resulted in comparable motor unit recruitment during fatiguing contractions. Our findings indicate that both low and high RIR training can be used to enhance fatiguability among previously resistance-trained adults.",2024,,PeerJ,12,,e18163,,10.7717/peerj.18163,39421412,#5,Beausejour 2024,"",""
Engaging Diverse African American/Black and Latine Youth and Emerging Adults Living with HIV into Research: Description of Recruitment Strategies and Lessons Learned.,Serrano S; Wilton L; Sherpa D; Cleland CM; Zaldivar MF; Maria ZK; Rosmarin-DeStefano C; Munson MR; Padilla AS; Gwadz M,"Improving engagement along the HIV care continuum and reducing racial/ethnic disparities are necessary to end the HIV epidemic. Research on African American/Black and Latine (AABL) younger people living with HIV (LWH) is essential to this goal. However, a number of key subgroups are challenging to locate and engage, and are therefore under-represented in research. Primary among these are persons with non-suppressed HIV viral load, severe socioeconomic disadvantage, transgender/gender expansive identities, and refugee/migrant/immigrant populations. Research in community settings is needed to complement studies conducted in medical institutions. The present study describes the efficiency of recruitment strategies used in the community to enroll AABL young and emerging adults LWH ages 19-28 years. Strategies were designed to be culturally responsive and structurally salient. They were: peer-to-peer, social media, classified advertisements (newspaper, craigslist), subway ads, dating apps (Jack'd, Positive Singles), and direct recruitment in community-based organizations. Data were analyzed using mainly descriptive statistics and interpreted using a consensus building approach. We screened 575 individuals in a first step, 409 were eligible (71%), of these 297 presented to the second screening step (73%), but 112 were lost. Almost all presenting at the second step were eligible (98%, 291/297) and 94% enrolled (274/291). Peer-to-peer, dating app (Jack'd), direct recruitment, and craigslist were the most efficient strategies. Recruitment on dating apps was superior to the peer-to-peer approach in yielding eligible participants (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 0.98-2.3; p = 0.06). The sample enrolled was diverse with respect to HIV viral suppression, gender identify, sexual orientation, immigration status, and barriers to HIV care engagement. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. Recruitment is a vital aspect of research and warrants attention in the empirical literature.",2024,Oct,AIDS Behav,,,,,10.1007/s10461-024-04524-7,39395069,#6,Serrano 2024,"",""
Gender challenges within the UK Defence Medical Services: recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce.,Swain C; Evans C; Kinkaid V; Keogh J; Orr L; King K,"While there are women represented in some notable positions within the UK Defence Medical Services (DMS), the challenges and barriers to successful female progression have not disappeared. The DMS needs highly talented, motivated doctors working to support operations, yet we struggle to recruit and retain female personnel. This is in clear contrast to the increased proportion of female personnel working within the civilian medical workforce.This article seeks to communicate this problem, illustrated by the lived experiences of DMS female doctors, by exploring the six gender bias barriers ('Glass Walls') that hold women back in the workplace.Cultural change requires a determined effort, driven persistently from the top and at every level of leadership and management. The first step requires recognition and acceptance of the problem. Progress is likely to be slow, or fail, if driven by the female minority alone. While the DMS remains a majority-male organisation, male allies are pivotal in advocating for their female colleagues, to promote change, in an effort to recruit and retain talented individuals.",2024,Sep,BMJ Mil Health,,,,,10.1136/military-2024-002753,39313292,#7,Swain 2024,"",""
Informed consent and coercion in recruitment advertisements for oocyte donors.,Lake R; Berzansky I; Lanes A; Srouji S; Ginsburg E; Insogna I,"BACKGROUND: As the use of donor eggs for in vitro treatment has increased, both medically affiliated and private donor egg agencies have turned to online advertisements to recruit donors. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine provides recommendations encouraging ethical recruitment of donors, however there is no formal regulation for the informed consent process for egg donor recruitment and compensation. Underrepresentation of risks and targeted financial incentives may pose a risk to the informed consent process. METHODS: Data from online advertisements for egg donors active between January 1 - August 31, 2020, were collected to analyze content related to risks, Covid-19 precautions, donor payment, and desired donor characteristics. Advertisements for egg donors on Google, Craigslist, and social media were analyzed. Primary outcomes included the mention of the risks of egg donation, including the risk of Covid-19 exposure, in donor egg advertisements. Secondary outcomes included language targeting specific donor characteristics and financial compensation. RESULTS: 103 advertisements were included. 35.9% (37/103) of advertisements mentioned some risk of the egg donation process, and 18.5% (19/103) mentioned risks or precautions related to Covid-19 exposure. Of advertisements for private donor egg agencies, 40.7% (24/59) mentioned any risk, compared to 29.6% (13/44) of medically affiliated egg donation programs; the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.24). Agencies targeting students and donors of a specific race were more likely to offer payments over $10,000 for an egg donation cycle. Among advertisements offering over $20,000 for donor compensation, 72.7% (8/11) recruited women under the age of 21. CONCLUSION: Egg donor recruitment advertisements, for both medically affiliated programs and private agencies, were unlikely to mention risks including the risk of exposure to Covid-19. Non-medically affiliated private donor egg agencies were more likely to violate multiple American Society for Reproductive Medicine ethics guidelines, including offering higher than average compensation, and recruiting donors from young and vulnerable populations.",2024,Sep,BMC Womens Health,24,1,526,,10.1186/s12905-024-03302-w,39300511,#8,Lake 2024,"",""
Cohort profile: DNA methylation in the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) - recruitment and participant characteristics.,Potter C; Hill C; Smyth LJ; Neville C; Scott A; Kee F; McGuinness B; McKnight A,"PURPOSE: Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation (DNAm) are proposed mechanisms by which social or environmental exposures may influence health and behaviours as we age. The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) DNAm cohort, established in 2013, is one of several worldwide, nationally representative prospective studies of ageing with biological samples from participants who consented to multiomic analysis. PARTICIPANTS: NICOLA recruited 8478 participants (8283 aged 50 years or older and 195 spouses or partners at the same address aged under 50 years). Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews, Self-Completion Questionnaires and detailed Health Assessments (HA) were completed. Of the 3471 (44.1%) participants who attended the HA in wave 1, which included venous blood sampling, 2000 were identified for the DNAm cohort. Following technical and data quality control checks, DNAm data are currently available for n=1870. FINDINGS TO DATE: There was no significant difference based on age, self-reported gender, education, employment, smoking or alcohol status and subjective health reports between the DNAm cohort and other HA attendees. Participants were more likely to be in the DNAm group if they lived with one other person (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.49). The DNAm group had a lower proportion of depressed participants and those meeting criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (11.7% and 4.4% vs 13.5% and 4.5%, respectively) categorised by objective assessment tools but this was not significant (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.19). FUTURE PLANS: The deeply phenotyped DNAm cohort in NICOLA with planned prospective follow-up and additional multiomic data releases will increase the cohort's utility for research into ageing. The genomic and epigenetic data for the DNAm cohort has been deposited on the European Genome-Phenome Archive, increasing the profile of this cohort and data availability to researchers.",2024,Sep,BMJ Open,14,9,e085652,,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-085652,39277204,#9,Potter 2024,"",""
Gendered hiring and attrition on the path to parity for academic faculty.,LaBerge N; Wapman KH; Clauset A; Larremore DB,"Despite long-running efforts to increase gender diversity among tenured and tenure-track faculty in the U.S., women remain underrepresented in most academic fields, sometimes dramatically so. Here, we quantify the relative importance of faculty hiring and faculty attrition for both past and future faculty gender diversity using comprehensive data on the training and employment of 268,769 tenured and tenure-track faculty rostered at 12,112U.S. PhD-granting departments, spanning 111 academic fields between 2011 and 2020. Over this time, we find that hiring had a far greater impact on women's representation among faculty than attrition in the majority (90.1%) of academic fields, even as academia loses a higher share of women faculty relative to men at every career stage. Finally, we model the impact of five specific policy interventions on women's representation, and project that eliminating attrition differences between women and men only leads to a marginal increase in women's overall representation-in most fields, successful interventions will need to make substantial and sustained changes to hiring in order to reach gender parity.",2024,Jul,Elife,13,,,,10.7554/eLife.93755,38984481,#10,LaBerge 2024,"",""

Solidifying the minority high school student pathway: evidence from the health professions recruitment and exposure program.,Affini MI; Diaz A; Dolan DJ; Fletcher S; Hasnain I; Selkridge I; Washington S; Pratt A,"PURPOSE: The objective of this report is to provide longitudinal insights on the impact of a health professions exposure program for high school students of underrepresented backgrounds in medicine. CONTEXT: Medical students at the University of Chicago reviewed data from their chapter of the Health Profession Recruitment and Exposure Program (HPREP) from 2016-2021 to discover trends in enrollment. This data is documented in the context of the program's mission to increase awareness of health disparities, the success of prominent alumni, and recent community efforts post-COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Two hundred and ninety-nine high school students participated in the University of Chicago HPREP program between 2016 and 2021. Participants ranged in age from 12 to 18 years (mean = 16, SD = 1) and 74% (n = 222) were female students. Of 252 respondents, 58% (n = 147) identified as Black or African American, 31% (n = 77) identified as Latinx or of Hispanic origin, and 10% (n = 24) identified as another race or as bi-racial. Ten or fewer black male students participated in the program every year, including the 2020-2021 year in which 61 students participated. CONCLUSIONS: HPREP has played an important role in shaping the face of health care, especially in Chicago.

Prevention at home in older persons with (pre-)frailty: analysis of participants' recruitment and characteristics of the randomized controlled PromeTheus trial.,Fleiner T; Nerz C; Denkinger M; Bauer JM; Grüneberg C; Dams J; Schäufele M; Büchele G; Rapp K; Werner C,"BACKGROUND: The ""PromeTheus"" trial is evaluating a home-based, multifactorial, interdisciplinary prevention program for community-dwelling (pre-)frail older adults. These individuals often suffer from reduced participation, which can complicate the recruitment and enrollment in a clinical trial. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate different recruitment strategies and differences in participant characteristics in relation to these strategies. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the randomized-controlled PromeTheus trial, in which community-dwelling (pre-)frail older persons (Clinical Frailty Scale [CFS] 4-6 pt., ≥ 70 years) were recruited via general practitioners (""GP recruitment"") or flyers, newspaper articles, and personalized letters (""direct recruitment""). Differences in the sociodemographic, clinical, physical, functional, mobility-related, psychological and social characteristics were analyzed in relation to the recruitment strategy. RESULTS: A total of 385 participants (mean age = 81.2, SD 5.9 years; women: n = 283, 73.5%) were enrolled, of which 60 (16%) were recruited by GPs and 325 (84%) through direct recruitment. Participants recruited via GPs had significantly higher subjective frailty levels (CFS), were more often physically frail (Fried Frailty Phenotype), and showed lower physical capacity (Short Physical Performance Battery), participation (disability component of the short version of the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument), and life-space mobility (Life-Space Assessment) compared to those recruited via the direct approach (p = 0.002-0.026). Costs per randomized participant were 94€ for the GP recruitment strategy and €213 for the direct recruitment strategy. CONCLUSION: Different strategies may be required to successfully recruit (pre-)frail home-living older adults into preventive programs. Direct recruitment strategies, in which potential participants are directly informed about the prevention program, seem to be more promising than GP recruitment but may result in enrolment of persons with less functional impairment and higher recruitment costs.

"Recruitment, retention, and experiences of Australian male dietitians: A cross-sectional online survey.",Stefoska-Needham A; Weber CM; Beck EJ; Craddock JC; Houston LA,"AIM: Male dietitians are under-represented in the global dietetics workforce, including in Australia. This study explores Australian males' experiences as dietitians in the Australian workforce, with the aim to identify influences that initially attracted them to dietetics, as well as barriers that may affect their decision to stay in or leave the profession. METHODS: A cross-sectional, semi-quantitative web-based survey was distributed to male dietitians using purposive, snowball sampling. Closed and open-ended questions were included. Descriptive statistics were generated, and content analysis of free-text responses identified major themes. RESULTS: Seventy-one respondents opened the survey link, of which 65 respondents attempted the survey. Fifty-four (83.1%) respondents agreed that dietetics is female-dominated. An interest in food and nutrition was the most reported reason for studying dietetics (73.8%). Of the 55 respondents who were not intending to retire in the next 5 years, 15 (27.3%) stated they were somewhat or extremely likely to leave the profession of dietetics. Respondents identified issues that impacted their experiences as a male dietitian, including gender differences, a lack of male role models, barriers to career progression/employment, and perceptions of a lack of respect and impact within healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Australian male dietitians perceive systemic, social, and personal factors that have influenced their career experiences.

Furthermore, cytological observation of spread pachytene meiotic chromosomes reveals that Lakl0C-left does not undergo synapsis. However, we show that the behavior of Lakl0C-left is independent of its particularly early replication timing and is not accompanied by any peculiar chromosome structure as detectable by Hi-C in this yet poorly studied yeast.

Reducing Sample Size While Improving Equity in Vaccine Clinical Trials: A Machine Learning-Based Recruitment Methodology with Application to Improving Trials of Hepatitis C Virus Vaccines in People Who Inject Drugs.,Chiu R; Tatara E; Mackesy-Amiti ME; Page K; Ozik J; Boodram B; Dahari H; Gutfraind A,"Despite the availability of direct-acting antivirals that cure individuals infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), developing a vaccine is critically needed in achieving HCV elimination. HCV vaccine trials have been performed in populations with high incidence of new HCV infection such as people who inject drugs (PWID). Developing strategies of optimal recruitment of PWID for HCV vaccine trials could reduce sample size, follow-up costs and disparities in enrollment. We investigate trial recruitment informed by machine learning and evaluate a strategy for HCV vaccine trials termed PREDICTEE-Predictive Recruitment and Enrichment method balancing Demographics and Incidence for Clinical Trial Equity and Efficiency. PREDICTEE utilizes a survival analysis model applied to trial candidates, considering their demographic and injection characteristics to predict the candidate's probability of HCV infection during the trial. The decision to recruit considers both the candidate's predicted incidence and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and race. We evaluated PREDICTEE using in silico methods, in which we first generated a synthetic candidate pool and their respective HCV infection events using HepCEP, a validated agent-based simulation model of HCV transmission among PWID in metropolitan Chicago. We then compared PREDICTEE to conventional recruitment of high-risk PWID who share drugs or injection equipment in terms of sample size and recruitment equity, with the latter measured by participation-to-prevalence ratio (PPR) across age, sex, and race. Comparing conventional recruitment to PREDICTEE found a reduction in sample size from 802 (95%: 642-1010) to 278 (95%: 264-294) with PREDICTEE, while also reducing screening requirements by 30%. Simultaneously, PPR increased from 0.475 (95%: 0.356-0.568) to 0.754 (95%: 0.685-0.834). Even when targeting a dissimilar maximally balanced population in which achieving recruitment equity would be more difficult, PREDICTEE is able to reduce sample size from 802 (95%: 642-1010) to 304 (95%: 288-322) while improving PPR to 0.807 (95%: 0.792-0.821).

Toward a new conceptual framework: Employing a Black feminist approach to the recruitment and retention of Black women faculty in health and medical degree programs.,Wade JM,"The sociodemographic makeup of the professoriate in health and healthcare has been shown to have direct implications for graduation rates among minoritized populations, diversity in healthcare, the prevalence of health equity scholarship, and population health broadly. Black women academics, who navigate higher education as members of two minoritized groups, need to be intentionally recruited and retained using tailored approaches. Given the historical and ongoing dearth of Black women faculty in health and healthcare, and the mounting literature on health equity highlighting the benefits of Black women representation in healthcare, I propose an approach to the recruitment and retention of Black women using a Black feminist theory.

For this reason, our study evaluated how young and old women coordinate and control the movement system while performing an unusual redundant motor control task through the network physiology approach. We acquired electromyographic signals from nine leg muscles of the dominant and non-dominant limbs during maximum voluntary isometric contractions (knee extension and flexion) and co-contraction bouts. Our results showed that young participants presented higher peak torque output, with similar EMG variability, compared to older participants. Considering firing rate frequencies, old and young women demonstrated different traits for network clustering and efficiency for the task. Age seems to affect muscle coordination at higher frequencies, even with a similar number of muscle synergies, indicating that younger women might have more integrated synergies than older women.

METHODS: We analysed 3 years of national recruitment data into Public Health specialty training to identify whether demographic characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity and professional background were associated with successful recruitment. RESULTS: In total 2252 applications between 2018 and 2020 were analysed. Candidates who were older, Asian, black or from backgrounds other than medicine were significantly less likely to progress from the psychometric testing stage than the white British group.

Challenges and strategies for recruitment of minorities to clinical research and trials.,Fisher-Hoch SP; Below JE; North KE; McCormick JB,"Minority populations are largely absent from clinical research trials. The neglect of these populations has become increasingly apparent, with escalating cancer burdens and chronic disease. The challenges to recruitment of minorities in the United States are multiple including trust or lack thereof. Keys to successful recruitment are responding to community issues, its history, beliefs, and its social and economic pressures. The strategy we have used in many low-income, sometimes remote, communities is to recruit staff from the same community and train them in the required basic research methods. They are the first line of communication. After our arrival in the Texas Rio Grande Valley in 2001, we applied these principles learned over years of global research, to studies of chronic diseases. Beginning in 2004, we recruited and trained a team of local women who enrolled in a cohort of over five thousand Mexican Americans from randomly selected households. This cohort is being followed, and the team has remained, acquiring not only advanced skills (ultrasound, FibroScan, retinal photos, measures of cognition, etc.) but capacity to derive key health information.

Modeling the impact of digital readiness in recruiting and sustaining underrepresented groups: Data from the All of Us research program.,Kini S; Duluk D; Weinstein J,"The All of Us Research Program (All of Us or Program) is an ongoing longitudinal data collection operated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Program aims to improve healthcare for all through the development of a biomedical research resource reflective of the diversity of the United States that includes Underrepresented in Biomedical Research (UBR) groups. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are a key recruitment stream of UBR participants, which are community based and provide primary care and preventive services in medically underserved areas. Over 90% of FQHC patients enrolled in All of Us to date are UBR. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a pause in All of Us activities. Re-starting the activities was a challenge, especially due to the digital divide faced by FQHC participants, and that most Program activities are primarily completed via web-based portal from a computer or a mobile device. This paper investigates the extent to which digital readiness impacted recruitment and sustainment of a pre-pandemic sample of 2,791 FQHC participants to the Program. Digital readiness was defined by access to home-based or other internet-accessing devices, and participants' comfort level using such devices. Results from multivariable logistic regression models showed that lower age, more education, female gender identity, and higher income were associated with higher digital readiness (p ≤ 0.01). Race, rurality, and sexual orientation status were not significant factors associated with digital readiness. Older participants had higher odds of completing Program activities, even though less digitally ready than their younger peers, as they often completed the activities during their in-person clinical visits. A subsequent weighted model demonstrated that FQHC participants who were digitally ready had 27% higher odds of completing Program activities than those not digitally ready. The data highlight the need for improved connectivity and sustainment between longitudinal data collection, research programs, and UBR participants, particularly among those facing the digital divide. Quantifying digital challenges provide operational insights for longitudinal data collection (All of Us, or others), and broadly, other aspects of digital medicine such as telehealth or patient portals by recognizing digital readiness of participants and patients, and the level of support required for success.",2022,,Front Digit Health,4,,1082098,,10.3389/fdgth.2022.1082098,37124163,#25,Kini 2022,"",""

Differential attainment in specialty training recruitment in the UK: an observational analysis of the impact of psychometric testing assessment in Public Health postgraduate selection.,Pinder RJ; Bury F; Sathyamoorthy G; Majeed A; Rao M,"OBJECTIVES: To determine how current psychometric testing approaches used in selection of postgraduate training in UK Public Health are associated with socioeconomic and sociocultural background of applicants (including ethnicity). DESIGN: Observational study using contemporaneous data collected during recruitment and psychometric test scores. SETTING: Assessment centre of UK national Public Health recruitment for postgraduate Public Health training. The assessment centre element of selection comprises three psychometric assessments: Rust Advanced Numerical Reasoning, Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Assessment II and Public Health situational judgement test. PARTICIPANTS: 629 applicants completed the assessment centre in 2021. 219 (34.8%) were UK medical graduates, 73 (116%) were international medical graduates and 337 (53.6%) were from backgrounds other than medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Multivariable-adjusted progression statistics in the form of adjusted OR (aOR), accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, professional background and surrogate measures of familial socioeconomic and sociocultural status. RESULTS: 357 (56.8%) candidates passed all three psychometric tests. Candidate characteristics negatively associated with progression were black ethnicity (aOR 0.19, 0.08 to 0.44), Asian ethnicity (aOR 0.35, 0.16 to 0.71) and coming from a non-UK medical graduate background (aOR 0.05, 0.03 to 0.12); similar differential attainment was observed in each of the psychometric tests.

Insights into recruitment strategies, enrolment rates and costs are valuable but rarely reported. We provide insight into the costs and results of used recruitment strategies, baseline characteristics and feasibility of at-home cardiometabolic measurements as part of the Supreme Nudge trial investigating healthy lifestyle behaviours. This trial was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring a largely remote data collection approach. Potential sociodemographic differences were explored between participants recruited through various strategies and for at-home measurement completion rates. METHODS: Participants were recruited from socially disadvantaged areas around participating study supermarkets (n = 12 supermarkets) across the Netherlands, aged 30-80 years, and regular shoppers of the participating supermarkets. Recruitment strategies, costs and yields were logged, together with completion rates of at-home measurements of cardiometabolic markers. Descriptive statistics are reported on recruitment yield per used method and baseline characteristics. We used linear and logistic multilevel models to assess the potential sociodemographic differences. RESULTS: Of 783 recruited, 602 were eligible to participate, and 421 completed informed consent. Most included participants were recruited via letters/flyers at home (75%), but this strategy was very costly per included participant (89 Euros). Of paid strategies, supermarket flyers were the cheapest (12 Euros) and the least time-invasive (< 1 h). Participants who completed baseline measurements (n = 391) were on average 57.6 (SD 11.0) years, 72% were female and 41% had high educational attainment, and they often completed the at-home measurements successfully (lipid profile 88%, HbA1c 94%, waist circumference 99%). Multilevel models suggested that males tended to be recruited more often via word-of-mouth (OR(females) 0.51 (95%CI 0.22; 1.21)). Those who failed the first attempt at completing the at-home blood measurement were older (β 3.89 years (95% CI 1.28; 6.49), whilst the non-completers of the HbA1c (β - 8.92 years (95% CI - 13.62; - 4.28)) and LDL (β - 3.19 years (95% CI - 6.53; 0.09)) were younger.

METHODS: A database of urology faculty and residents in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education programs was created. Demographic data were obtained from departmental websites, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Doximity. Program prestige was defined by U.S. News and World Report rankings. Program location and city size were determined using the U.S. Census data. Multivariable analysis was performed assessing the association of gender, AUA section, city size, and rankings on underrepresented in medicine recruitment. RESULTS: Of urologists in this study 8.7% were underrepresented in medicine status. More women urologists were underrepresented in medicine (31.4%) than non-underrepresented in medicine (21.3%; P < .001). Factors predictive of more underrepresented in medicine urologists were practice in South Central AUA section (OR 2.1, P = .04), and medium metro areas (OR 1.6, P < .01). Among residents, factors predictive of more underrepresented in medicine urologists were female gender (P < .001), living in medium metro areas (P = .03), and training in top 10 programs (P = .001).

Nocturnal surveys of lined seahorses reveal increased densities and seasonal recruitment patterns.,Mason HD; Rose E; Gonzalez JE; O'Brien DA,"Although the nighttime ecology of organisms remains understudied, nocturnal surveys play an integral part in assessing fish assemblages and the selective forces shaping them. Eleuthera (Bahamas) contains an unusual population of lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) in an anchialine lake, possessing morphological characteristics distinct from those found in the ocean. Population surveys for seahorses and their potential predators were conducted at midnight and midday during wet and dry seasons, with belt transects perpendicular to the shoreline that increased in depth away from shore. Nocturnal surveys uncovered seahorse densities 259% higher than daytime transects on average. Sex ratios were consistently male-biased, and the frequency of animals from different reproductive categories varied significantly by time of day, with gravid males observed around the clock but females and nongravid males observed more often at night. Spatial and seasonal recruitment was detected for the first time in this species, with an increase in juveniles detected in the shallow ends of transects during dry season surveys. Juvenile recruitment is poorly understood across syngnathid fishes, so the detection of early recruits at night has broad implications for this fish family. Seahorses from all reproductive categories were perched significantly higher in the water column during the night regardless of their depth or season. Predator densities followed a similar pattern with higher densities observed at night, indicating that elevated nocturnal perch height may be a response to predator presence.

Following training, many begin their employment in medicine as early-career hospitalists, the majority being millennials. OBJECTIVE: To understand what elements influence millennial hospitalists' recruitment and retention. DESIGN: We developed a survey that asked participants to rate the level of importance of 18 elements (4-point Likert scale) in their decision to choose or remain at an HMG.

Descriptive statistics and chi square tests were used. RESULTS: Enrollment benchmarks were met overall (N = 382) and for participants from underrepresented race/ethnic backgrounds (58.0%), but not men (17.3%). The most common recruitment sources were email (26.9%), radio (22.2%), and online radio (15.4%); this pattern largely held true across gender and race/ethnic groups, though word of mouth and participant referral together accounted for nearly a quarter of enrolled men. Costs averaged $155 per randomized participant. Retention was 89% at 3-months, 84% at 6-months (primary endpoint) and 80% at 12-months (follow-up), with no significant differences by gender or race/ethnicity (all p's > 0.05). Retention did not differ by recruitment method (p = .69).

"Differential attainment and recruitment to Intensive Care Medicine Training in the UK, 2018-2020.",Tridente A; Parry-Jones J; Chandrashekaraiah S; Bryden D,"BACKGROUND: Differences exist among doctors in examination performance, clinical and academic career progression, and prevalence of performance assessment by professional regulatory bodies. Some of these differences have been reported in relation to individual characteristics. The purpose of this study is to establish whether any specific individual characteristics are associated with performance in selection for entry into specialty training in Intensive Care in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We evaluated data of 509 candidates from the national recruitment rounds of 2018/19 and 2019/20. The outcome evaluated was ""success at interview"". Variables reaching statistical significance at univariate logistic regression analysis were fed in the multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of success, with additional exploratory analyses performed, where indicated. RESULTS: The candidates' median age was 31.5 (interquartile range, IQR 30-33.7) years, 324 (63.7%) were male, 256 (50.3%) not married/in civil partnership, 6 (1.2%) pregnant. The majority (316, 62.1%) were White British, 99 (19.5%) of Asian background, other ethnicities represented less than 20% of the sample. Of the 509 candidates, 155 (30.5%) were Atheist, 140 (27.5%) Christian; most were heterosexual (440, 86.4%); 432 (84.9%) reported no disability, while 4 (0.8%) had a minor and 1 (0.2%) had a major disability; 432 (84.9%) candidates held a UK medical degree; 77 (15.1%) a non-UK degree. At univariate logistic regression analysis (LRA) multiple factors were found to be associated with a lower likelihood of success, the strongest being an international medical graduate (IMG, holding a non-UK medical degree); others were increasing age, male gender, being married, Asian or mixed ethnicity, specific religious beliefs (Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism). After feeding all factors significant at univariate analysis, the only two retained as independent predictors at multivariable regression were Asian ethnicity and holding a non-UK degree. Asian UK graduates success rate was 92.7%, comparable to the national average of 92.3%, the Asian IMGs success rate was significantly lower, at 45.5%. CONCLUSIONS: As the imbalances seen within the candidates of Asian background are explained by considering the country of primary medical training, the variations in performance is likely to reflect differences in training systems and understanding of the UK NHS.",2022,Sep,BMC Med Educ,22,1,672,,10.1186/s12909-022-03732-w,36089594,#36,Tridente 2022,"",""
Enigma of the cholesterol paradox in acute myocardial infarction: lessons from an 8-year follow-up of all-cause mortality in an age-matched and sex-matched case-control study with controls from the patients' recruitment area.,Nilsson G; Leppert J; Ohrvik J,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on long-term all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and controls. DESIGN: Matched case-control study with 8-year follow-up. SETTING: Vastmanland County Hospital, Vasteras, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients with AMI admitted to the coronary care unit from March 2005 to May 2010 and age-matched and sex-matched controls from the general population. OUTCOME MEASURES: ACM. RESULTS: Person-year at risk among patients with AMI and controls was 11 667 (cases: 5780 and controls: 5887). During follow-up, 199 patients and 84 controls died, implying 3.4 deaths among patients and 1.4 among controls per 100 person-years at risk. Unadjusted Cox analyses showed significantly increasing mortality by decreasing TC and LDL-C levels in both patients (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.79, p<0.001, and HR=0.64, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.74, p<0.001) and controls (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.89, p=0.002, and HR=0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93, p=0.010). After adjusting for clinical variables, the results for the patients remained significant. Cox analyses of the relations between mortality and TC and LDL-C below and above their respective medians revealed the following pattern. PATIENTS: below medians were TC and LDL-C levels significantly inversely related to mortality; above medians there were no relations with mortality. CONTROLS: below medians were TC and LDL-C levels significantly inversely related to mortality; above medians were LDL-C levels significantly positively related to mortality. Mean LDL-C level in patients with blood sampled >12 hours after symptom onset was 0.41 mmol/L lower than that in patients with blood sampled ≤12 hours (p=0.030). This LDL-C decrease was reasonably caused by ongoing AMI and reflects the difference in LDL-C levels between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, lower TC and LDL-C levels independently predict higher ACM. In their controls, LDL-C levels above the median independently predict higher ACM.

DESIGN: Study Within A Trial using random cluster allocation within the Forearm Fracture Recovery in Children Evaluation (FORCE) study. SETTING: Emergency departments in 23 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 1409 children aged 4-16 years attending with a torus (buckle) fracture, and their parents/guardian. Children's mean age was 9.2 years, 41.0% were female, 77.4% were ethnically White and 90.0% spoke English as a first language. INTERVENTIONS: Participants and their parents/guardian received trial information either via multimedia, including animated videos, talking head videos and text (revised for readability and age appropriateness when needed) on tablet computer (MMI group; n=681), or printed participant information sheet (PIS group; n=728). OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was recruitment rate to FORCE. Secondary outcomes were Decision-Making Questionnaire (nine Likert items, analysed summatively and individually), three 'free text' questions (deriving subjective evaluations) and trial retention. RESULTS: MMI produced a small, not statistically significant increase in recruitment: 475 (69.8%) participants were recruited from the MMI group; 484 (66.5%) from the PIS group (OR=1.35; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.40, p=0.31).

Does Ageist Language in Job Ads Predict Age Discrimination in Hiring?,Burn I; Button P; Munguia Corella L; Neumark D,"We study the relationships between ageist stereotypes - as reflected in the language used in job ads - and age discrimination in hiring, exploiting the text of job ads and differences in callbacks to older and younger job applicants from a resume (correspondence study) field experiment (Neumark, Burn, and Button, 2019). Our analysis uses computational linguistics and machine learning methods to examine, in a field-experiment setting, ageist stereotypes that might underlie age discrimination in hiring. In so doing, we develop methods and a framework for analyzing textual data, highlighting the usefulness of various computer science techniques for empirical economics research. We find evidence that language related to stereotypes of older workers sometimes predicts discrimination against older workers. For men, we find evidence that age stereotypes about all three categories we consider - health, personality, and skill - predict age discrimination, and for women, age stereotypes about personality predict age discrimination. In general, the evidence that age stereotypes predict age discrimination is much stronger for men, and our results for men are quite consistent with the industrial psychology literature on age stereotypes.",2022,Jul,J Labor Econ,40,3,613-667,,10.1086/717730,35845105,#39,Burn 2022,"",""

Interview with an avatar: Comparing online and virtual reality perspective taking for gender bias in STEM hiring decisions.,Crone CL; Kallen RW,"Virtual perspective taking can reduce unconscious bias and increase empathy and prosocial behavior toward individuals who are marginalized based on group stereotypes such as age, race, or socioeconomic status. However, the question remains whether this approach might reduce implicit gender bias, and the degree to which virtual immersion contributes to behavioral modulation following perspective taking tasks is unknown. Accordingly, we investigate the role of virtual perspective taking for binary gender using an online platform (Study 1) and immersive virtual reality (Study 2). Female and male undergraduates performed a simulated interview while virtually represented by an avatar that was either congruent or incongruent with their own gender. All participants rated a male and a female candidate on competence, hireability, likeability, empathy, and interpersonal closeness and then chose one of these two equivalently qualified candidates to hire for a laboratory assistant position in the male dominated industry of information technology. Online perspective taking did not reveal a significant influence of avatar gender on candidate ratings or candidate choice, whereas virtual reality perspective taking resulted in significant changes to participant behavior following exposure to a gender-incongruent avatar (e.g., male embodied as female), such that men showed preference for the female candidate and women showed preference for the male candidate. Although between-group differences in candidate ratings were subtle, rating trends were consistent with substantial differences in candidate choice, and this effect was greater for men. Compared to an online approach, virtual reality perspective taking appears to exert greater influence on acute behavioral modulation for gender bias due to its ability to fully immerse participants in the experience of (temporarily) becoming someone else, with empathy as a potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon.",2022,,PLoS One,17,6,e0269430,,10.1371/journal.pone.0269430,35671314,#41,Crone 2022,"",""
Identifying leaks in the STEM recruitment pipeline among sexual and gender minority US secondary students.,Xavier Hall CD; Wood CV; Hurtado M; Moskowitz DA; Dyar C; Mustanski B,"PURPOSE: Research establishes the critical need to address the underrepresentation of women and racial/ethnic minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). While emergent research addresses similar challenges for sexual and gender minorities (SGM), this research remains scant and focuses on adult experiences. This analysis examines subgroup differences and the impact of bullying on STEM engagement outcomes among a national sample of SGM secondary students in the U.S. METHOD: This report provides descriptive and multivariable regression analysis of national survey data (n = 539) on the experiences of pre-college students who identify as SGM, including the effects of within-school anti-SGM bullying on STEM identity, perceptions of STEM climate, and STEM intentions. RESULTS: Roughly 50% of the sample intended to enter a STEM field (compared to 25% in previous general samples). Bullying in school was negatively associated with STEM identity and perceptions of STEM climate. Sense of belonging is positively associated with perceptions of STEM climate and STEM intentions. Being non-binary and being a transgender man were associated with decreased sense of belonging and negative perception of STEM climate. CONCLUSION: This report is the first to identify factors influencing STEM engagement among SGM secondary students and suggests that issues of STEM engagement are already present in adolescence. Moreover, the findings also establish the relationship between anti-SGM bullying and STEM outcomes highlighting the importance of this marginalization experience. Future research should further examine sub-group differences and the persistence of these effects.

Advancing Equity in Academic Medicine Through Holistic Review for Faculty Recruitment and Retention.,Harris TB; Jacobs NN; Fuqua CF; Lyness JM; Smith PO; Poll-Hunter NI; Piggott C; Monroe AD,"The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 2007 developed the Holistic Review Framework for medical school admissions to increase mission-aligned student diversity. This approach balances an applicant's experiences, attributes, and metrics during the screening, interview, and selection processes. Faculty recruitment provides its own set of challenges, and there is persistent underrepresentation of certain racial and ethnic minority groups and women in faculty and leadership positions in U.S. academic health centers (AHCs). In 2019, the AAMC initiated a pilot program to adapt and implement the framework for use in faculty recruitment at AHCs. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe the pilot implementation of the Holistic Review Framework for Faculty Recruitment and Retention and share lessons learned to date. Although the pilot proceeded during 2020, institutional implementation was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice movement. Pilot institutions encountered hiring freezes, reductions in funding, and restrictions on in-person meetings due to COVID-19 that resulted in both barriers and opportunities in implementing the framework. Renewed commitment to racial justice was associated with increased momentum and urgency for the implementation of faculty holistic review at the majority of pilot institutions. Common themes from the pilot leads' experiences included the importance of achieving ""buy in,"" having a dedicated implementation team, and being explicit about core values. Other themes included the importance of adaptability and flexibility to meet the needs of different institutions and mission areas. The faculty holistic review framework has shown promise as an approach to advancing faculty diversity goals. The pilot institutions will continue to share best practices, track outcomes, implement quality improvement, and disseminate findings to assist other institutions and health care communities with their endeavors to recruit and retain diverse faculty.",2022,May,Acad Med,97,5,631-634,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004568,34935728,#43,Harris 2022,"",""
Recruiting Black Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) Couples via Dating Apps: Pilot Study on Challenges and Successes.,Witkovic YD; Kim HC; Bright DJ; Tan JY,"BACKGROUND: HIV disproportionately impacts Black men who have sex with men (MSM), and targeting the primary relationship (ie, couples) using mobile technology for health holds promise for HIV prevention. Web-based recruitment of MSM is commonly employed in HIV prevention and intervention research. However, little known about recruiting Black MSM couples on the internet in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the process of recruiting Black MSM couples over social networking and dating apps frequented by MSM. We describe the activities for recruiting, screening, and enrolling participants as part of a randomized trial employing a multipronged recruitment approach. METHODS: Black MSM in couples were recruited via three apps (ie, Jack'd, Adam4Adam, and Growlr) between May 2020 and March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Black MSM couples were eligible if one or both partners are Black, MSM, and living with HIV, and if both partners were 18 years or older, and have been together for at least 2 months in what they both consider a primary relationship (ie, one in which both partners reported feeling most committed to over any other partner or relationship). RESULTS: A total of 10 Black MSM couples (n=20) were enrolled via social networking apps. App recruitment activities were a combination of passive (eg, in-app advertisements) and active (eg, direct messaging of users) engagement. Recruitment approaches varied by the social networking app owing to differences in app features. A full-time recruiter experienced challenges such as bugs (ie, technical errors in computer program or system), navigating technical requirements specific to each app, and web-based harassment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges, it was possible to recruit Black MSM couples virtually into research as part of a multipronged recruitment strategy. We identify tips for using web-based dating and other social networking apps as part of a recruitment strategy in future research with Black MSM couples.",2022,Apr,JMIR Form Res,6,4,e31901,,10.2196/31901,35394432,#44,Witkovic 2022,"",""

Applying XAI to an AI-based system for candidate management to mitigate bias and discrimination in hiring.,Hofeditz L; Clausen S; Rieß A; Mirbabaie M; Stieglitz S,"Assuming that potential biases of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems can be identified and controlled for (e.g., by providing high quality training data), employing such systems to augment human resource (HR)-decision makers in candidate selection provides an opportunity to make selection processes more objective. However, as the final hiring decision is likely to remain with humans, prevalent human biases could still cause discrimination. This work investigates the impact of an AI-based system's candidate recommendations on humans' hiring decisions and how this relation could be moderated by an Explainable AI (XAI) approach. We used a self-developed platform and conducted an online experiment with 194 participants. Our quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that the recommendations of an AI-based system can reduce discrimination against older and female candidates but appear to cause fewer selections of foreign-race candidates.

"Does AI Debias Recruitment? Race, Gender, and AI's ""Eradication of Difference"".",Drage E; Mackereth K,"In this paper, we analyze two key claims offered by recruitment AI companies in relation to the development and deployment of AI-powered HR tools: (1) recruitment AI can objectively assess candidates by removing gender and race from their systems, and (2) this removal of gender and race will make recruitment fairer, help customers attain their DEI goals, and lay the foundations for a truly meritocratic culture to thrive within an organization. We argue that these claims are misleading for four reasons: First, attempts to ""strip"" gender and race from AI systems often misunderstand what gender and race are, casting them as isolatable attributes rather than broader systems of power. Second, the attempted outsourcing of ""diversity work"" to AI-powered hiring tools may unintentionally entrench cultures of inequality and discrimination by failing to address the systemic problems within organizations. Third, AI hiring tools' supposedly neutral assessment of candidates' traits belie the power relationship between the observer and the observed. Specifically, the racialized history of character analysis and its associated processes of classification and categorization play into longer histories of taxonomical sorting and reflect the current demands and desires of the job market, even when not explicitly conducted along the lines of gender and race. Fourth, recruitment AI tools help produce the ""ideal candidate"" that they supposedly identify through by constructing associations between words and people's bodies. From these four conclusions outlined above, we offer three key recommendations to AI HR firms, their customers, and policy makers going forward.",2022,,Philos Technol,35,4,89,,10.1007/s13347-022-00543-1,36246553,#47,Drage 2022,"",""
Evidence of Specialty-Specific Gender Disparities in Resident Recruitment and Selection.,Bowe SN; Wang X; Whipple ME; Bly RA,"BACKGROUND: Specialty-specific gender disparities are multifactorial, yet one area that is lacking from this discussion is the impact of recruitment and selection. OBJECTIVE: Customized data reports were utilized to compare trends in the gender representation of applicants and residents within 11 surgical and medical specialties between 2013 and 2018. METHODS: Applicant data was obtained from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and resident data from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Eleven specialties with the highest number of applications per applicant were included (dermatology, emergency medicine, general surgery, neurological surgery, obstetrics and gynecology [OB/GYN], orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, radiation oncology, radiology, urology). A Cochran-Armitage trend test assessed for changes in the proportion of females within the total applicant group and the corresponding matched resident group. A t test was utilized to compare the mean proportion of females for ERAS and ACGME data. RESULTS: Otolaryngology, plastic surgery, radiation oncology, and urology had no significant changes over the study period. Dermatology, general surgery, and orthopedic surgery demonstrated increased gender diversity in applicants over time, while OB/GYN demonstrated decreased gender diversity. General surgery and neurological surgery showed increased gender diversity in resident representation over time. Emergency medicine and radiology had increased gender diversity, and OB/GYN had decreased gender diversity in matched residents compared to applicants.

This study provides an update on recent trends in faculty promotion in U.S. medical schools. METHOD: Using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster, the authors examined trends in faculty promotion over 10 years. Promotion status for full-time assistant and full-time associate professors who started between 2000 and 2009 inclusive was followed from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2019. The authors used bivariate analyses to assess associations and promotion rates by sex, race/ethnicity, department, tenure status, and degree type. RESULTS: The promotion rate for assistant professors was 44.3% (2,330/5,263) in basic science departments, 37.1% (17,232/46,473) in clinical science departments, and 33.6% (131/390) in other departments. Among clinical departments, family medicine had the lowest rate of promoting assistant professors (24.4%; 484/1,982) and otolaryngology the highest rate (51.2%; 282/551).

These differences were less pronounced among associate professors; however, URM and nontenured faculty continued to have lower promotion rates compared with White, Asian, or tenured faculty at the associate professor level. CONCLUSIONS: Promotion rates varied not only by faculty rank but also by faculty sex, race/ethnicity, department, tenure status, and degree type.

"Factors influencing emergency medicine residency choice: Diversity, community, and recruitment red flags.",Weygandt PL; Smylie L; Ordonez E; Jordan J; Chung AS,"BACKGROUND: Emergency medicine (EM) applicants consider many factors when selecting residency programs. Prior studies have demonstrated that applicants consider geography as well as modifiable/nonmodifiable program factors. Less attention, however, has been paid to underrepresented groups. Additionally, the prevalence and characteristics of ""red flags,"" or factors that may lead an applicant to lower a program's rank or not rank it at all, remain unknown in EM. Our objective was to describe the factors that influence current EM-bound medical students' residency selection focusing on underrepresented applicants and red flags encountered during the recruitment process. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods survey study of EM-bound graduates from U.S. medical schools in the 2020 application cycle. Quantitative analysis included descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), nonparametric tests for ordinal data, and logistic regression. For the qualitative portion of the study, two independent reviewers performed a thematic analysis of the red flag free-text responses. Discrepancies were addressed via consensus with third-party oversight. RESULTS: Our survey response rate was 49%, and most applicants considered both geographic and program factors. Underrepresented applicants prioritized program diversity, program commitment to the underserved, neighborhood/community, and patient population. Of all respondents, 71% reported red flags. Women had a significantly higher odds of encountering red flags (odds ratio = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.25 to 2.18). Red flags included seven key themes: violations of regulatory standards, program characteristics, interview day experience, program culture, interpersonal interactions, lack of fit, and quality of life; subthemes included lack of diversity and racism. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable/nonmodifiable program factors and geography continue to influence EM-bound applicants' residency choices. Underrepresented applicants place a higher value on diversity, community, and patients served. Residency programs should consider modifiable factors and self-assess for red flags to successfully recruit the next generation of EM physicians.",2021,Aug,AEM Educ Train,5,4,e10638,,10.1002/aet2.10638,34485803,#52,Weygandt 2021,"",""

"Seal body condition and atmospheric circulation patterns influence polar bear body condition, recruitment, and feeding ecology in the Chukchi Sea.",Rode KD; Regehr EV; Bromaghin JF; Wilson RR; St Martin M; Crawford JA; Quakenbush LT,"Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are experiencing loss of sea ice habitats used to access their marine mammal prey. Simultaneously, ocean warming is changing ecosystems that support marine mammal populations. The interactive effects of sea ice and prey are not well understood yet may explain spatial-temporal variation in the response of polar bears to sea ice loss. Here, we examined the potential combined effects of sea ice, seal body condition, and atmospheric circulation patterns on the body condition, recruitment, diet, and feeding probability of 469 polar bears captured in the Chukchi Sea, 2008-2017. The body condition of ringed seals (Pusa hispida), the primary prey of females and subadults, was related to dietary proportions of ringed seal, feeding probability, and the body condition of females and cubs. In contrast, adult males consumed more bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and exhibited better condition when bearded seal body condition was higher. The litter size, number of yearlings per adult female, and the condition of dependent young were higher following winters characterized by low Arctic Oscillation conditions, consistent with a growing number of studies. Body condition, recruitment, and feeding probability were either not associated or negatively associated with sea ice conditions, suggesting that, unlike some subpopulations, Chukchi Sea bears are not currently limited by sea ice availability. However, spring sea ice cover declined 2% per year during our study reaching levels not previously observed in the satellite record and resulting in the loss of polar bear hunting and seal pupping habitat. Our study suggests that the status of ice seal populations is likely an important factor that can either compound or mitigate the response of polar bears to sea ice loss over the short term. In the long term, neither polar bears nor their prey are likely robust to limitless loss of their sea ice habitat.",2021,Jun,Glob Chang Biol,27,12,2684-2701,,10.1111/gcb.15572,33644944,#54,Rode 2021,"",""
Looking Beyond the Numbers: Increasing Diversity and Inclusion Through Holistic Review in General Surgery Recruitment.,Nehemiah A; Roberts SE; Song Y; Kelz RR; Butler PD; Morris JB; Aarons CB,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is the examine the effect of a holistic review process on the recruitment of women and students underrepresented in medicine (UIM) in a general surgery residency program. DESIGN: A retrospective study comparing the proportion of women and UIM students ranked and matched into categorical positions from 2013 to 2020 before and after the implementation of the holistic application review process. United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) scores and American Board of Surgery In-training Exam (ABSITE) scores were also compared between groups. SETTING: General Surgery residency program at a tertiary, academic center. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students applying for and matriculated to categorical positions. RESULTS: After the implementation of holistic review in 2017, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of women (42% vs. 61%, p < 0.01) and UIM students (14% vs. 20%, p = 0.046) ranked in our program compared with the prior ""traditional"" approach. The proportion of matched female (33% vs. 54%, p = 0.11) and UIM applicants (14% vs. 21%, p = 0.48) also increased after holistic review, although the changes were not statistically significant. The median USMLE Step 1 scores were equivalent for both ranked (250 vs. 250, p = 0.81) and matched (250 vs. 249, p = 0.32) applicants before and after the intervention. The median ABSITE scores for the matched intern classes was lower after initiation of holistic review (519 vs. 483, p = 0.01). However, these scores were consistently above the national medians and subgroup analysis showed no difference between the median aggregate ABSITE scores for UIM and female categorical interns and non-UIM males (475 vs. 520, p = 0.09).

Intrinsic Neuronal Activity during Migration Controls the Recruitment of Specific Interneuron Subtypes in the Postnatal Mouse Olfactory Bulb.,Bugeon S; Haubold C; Ryzynski A; Cremer H; Platel JC,"Neuronal activity has been identified as a key regulator of neuronal network development, but the impact of activity on migration and terminal positioning of interneuron subtypes is poorly understood. The absence of early subpopulation markers and the presence of intermingled migratory and postmigratory neurons make the developing cerebral cortex a difficult model to answer these questions. Postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) offers a more accessible and compartmentalized model. Neural stem cells regionalized along the border of the lateral ventricle produce two main subtypes of neural progenitors, granule cells and periglomerular neurons that migrate tangentially in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) before migrating radially in the olfactory bulb (OB) layers. Here, we used targeted postnatal electroporation to compare the migration of these two populations in male and female mice. We do not observe any obvious differences regarding the mode of tangential or radial migration between these two subtypes. However, we find a striking increase of intrinsic calcium activity in granule cell precursors (GC-Ps) when they switch from tangential to radial migration. By decreasing neuronal excitability in GC-Ps, we find that neuronal activity has little effect on migration but is required for normal positioning and survival of GC-Ps in the OB layers. Strikingly, decreasing activity of periglomerular neuron precursors (PGN-Ps) did not impact their positioning or survival. Altogether these findings suggest that neuronal excitability plays a subtype specific role during the late stage of migration of postnatally born OB interneurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT While neuronal activity is a critical factor regulating different aspects of neurogenesis, it has been challenging to study its role during the migration of different neuronal subpopulations. Here, we use postnatal targeted electroporation to label and manipulate the two main olfactory bulb (OB) interneuron subpopulations during their migration: granule cell and periglomerular neuron precursors (PGN-Ps). We find a very striking increase of calcium activity only in granule cell precursors (GC-Ps) when they switch from tangential to radial migration. Interestingly, blocking activity in GC-Ps affected mainly their positioning and survival while PGN-Ps were not affected. These results suggest that neuronal activity is required specifically for the recruitment of GC-Ps in the OB layers.",2021,Mar,J Neurosci,41,12,2630-2644,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1960-20.2021,33536198,#56,Bugeon 2021,"",""
Male Deep-Sea Shrimps Aristeus antennatus at Fishing Grounds: Growth and First Evaluation of Recruitment by Multilocus Genotyping.,Abras A; García-Marín JL; Heras S; Vera M; Agulló M; Planella L; Roldán MI,"The population biology of the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus, as with other exploited demersal species, is usually studied using data from fishery statistics. Such statistical analyses have shown female-biased sex ratios during the spawning season in this species. Because the abundance of males increases at greater depths that are not exploited by fisheries (virgin grounds), knowledge on their recruitment is limited. Here, the growth and recruitment of A. antennatus males at fishing grounds was evaluated. This was achieved by integrating information on previously identified breeding behaviours and by tracing the young-of-year cohort through genotyping at 10 microsatellite loci. Using a codend and a codend cover with distinct meshed windows, four groups of males were collected in winter and in a subsequent spawning summer season. Summer collections were mostly composed of pre-adult males, reaching sizes that are to be expected from the growth of winter juveniles; however, many specimens also originated from nearby grounds. This result indicates the horizontal dispersal of male juveniles via intermediate and deep oceanographic currents. Such dispersal complements passive larval dispersal in surface waters, and contributes to the weak genetic divergence among regional fishing grounds. These features could be shared by other deep-sea crustacean and fish species, and should be considered for the sustainable exploitation of demersal fisheries.",2021,Feb,Life (Basel),11,2,,,10.3390/life11020116,33557042,#57,Abras 2021,"",""
Striving for Inclusive Excellence in the Recruitment of Diverse Surgical Residents During COVID-19.,Gerull KM; Enata N; Welbeck AN; Aleem AW; Klein SE,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the 2020 residency application cycle and resulted in many changes to the usual application processes. Particular attention should be placed on the obstacles faced by applicants who are underrepresented in medicine (URiM) as they may be disproportionately affected by the changes in 2020. These challenges are especially relevant in competitive surgical specialties, where racial and gender diversity already lags behind other medical specialties. Inclusive excellence is a guiding philosophy in creating equitable resident selection processes. It focuses on the multilayered processes that form the foundation of inclusive institutional culture, while recognizing that excellence and inclusivity are mutually reinforcing and not mutually exclusive. A key tenant in inclusive excellence for resident recruiting involves applying an equity lens in all decision making. An equity lens allows programs to continuously evaluate resident selection policies and processes through an intentional equity-forward approach. In addition to using an equity lens, programs should emphasize the importance of equity-focused skill building, which ensures that all individuals engaged in the resident selection process have the tools and knowledge to recognize biases. Finally, institutions should implement specific programming for URiM applicants to provide them with information about key aspects of department culture and mechanisms of support for URiM trainees. Every residency program should adopt a sustained perspective of inclusive excellence, in this application cycle and beyond. The status quo has existed for far too long, and COVID-19 offers institutions and their residency programs a unique opportunity to try new and innovative equity-forward practices.",2021,Feb,Acad Med,96,2,210-212,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003812,33116059,#58,Gerull 2021,"",""

Recruitment in Surgery and Interventional Radiology: Factors in Female Trainees' Specialty Decisions.,Matsumoto MM; Schultz O; Jiang T; Navuluri R,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify factors influencing female medical students' decision-making about specialties, specifically surgery and interventional radiology (IR), in an effort to inform future recruitment and professional development strategies. DESIGN: An electronic survey was created to assess both qualitative and quantitative data. SETTING: The survey was sent prior to a symposium for trainees interested in pursuing IR or surgery, held at University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) in February 2019. PARTICIPANTS: The 90 female trainees who registered were sent the survey, and 48 (53%) responded voluntarily. RESULTS: All respondents were female, 46% planned to pursue surgery or IR. Students pursuing surgery/IR were less concerned about being valued by their colleagues (p = 0.0073), being in charge of patients' lives (p = 0.0017), radiation exposure (p = 0.0171), chemical exposure (p = 0.0223), emotional stress (p = 0.0244), or shift work (p = 0.0045), compared to the nonsurgery/IR students. No differences were found in ranking of motivating factors, personal strengths or weaknesses, deciding factors, areas for seeking mentorship, or gender diversity. Top motivations among all respondents were intellectual rigor of medicine and becoming a mentor, while concerns were personal physical health, managing a career, pay equity, and gender-based biases. Students most often sought mentors and clerkship experience for making specialty decisions. They reported greatest strengths in empathy and resilience, and weaknesses in negotiating and public speaking. CONCLUSIONS: Female medical students planning to pursue surgery/IR expressed greater confidence in their contributions to patient care and lower concerns about workplace hazards. Regardless of specialty intent, female students shared scholarship motivations for a career in medicine, valued the role of mentorship, and expressed persistent concerns about gender discrimination, personal health, and skills-based weaknesses.

For verbal fluency, strategies of clustering and switching have been described. Our results show that men show higher activation in the brain network supporting clustering, while women show higher activation in the brain network supporting switching.

Some of this difference may relate to non-representative sampling. In some communities, household surveys are not appropriate and phone surveys not feasible. Here we describe activities undertaken to implement a representative sampling strategy in an urban Aboriginal setting. We also assess our likely success. METHODS: We used a quota-based convenience sample, stratified by age, gender and socioeconomic status to recruit Indigenous Australian adults (aged 16+) in an urban location in South Australia. Between July and October 2019, trained research staff (n = 7/10, Aboriginal) recruited community members to complete a tablet computer-based survey on drinking. Recruitment occurred from local services, community events and public spaces. The sampling frame and recruitment approach were documented, including contacts between research staff and services, and then analysed. To assess representativeness of the sample, demographic features were compared to the 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing. RESULTS: Thirty-two services assisted with data collection. Many contacts (1217) were made by the research team to recruit organisations to the study (emails: n = 610; phone calls: n = 539; texts n = 33; meetings: n = 34, and one Facebook message). Surveys were completed by 706 individuals - equating to more than one third of the local population (37.9%). Of these, half were women (52.5%), and the average age was 37.8 years. Sample characteristics were comparable with the 2016 Census in relation to gender, age, weekly individual income, Indigenous language spoken at home and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Elements key to recruitment included: 1) stratified sampling with multi-site, service-based recruitment, as well as data collection events in public spaces; 2) local services' involvement in developing and refining the sampling strategy; and 3) expertise and local relationships of local Aboriginal research assistants, including health professionals from the local Aboriginal health and drug and alcohol services.

#Shemergency: Use of a Professional Development Group to Promote Female Resident Recruitment and Retention.,Khatri UG; Love J; Zeidan A; Hsu CH; Mills AM,"PROBLEM: Gender inequity in academic medicine is a pervasive challenge. Recommendations have been implemented to reduce inequities for female faculty. However, there are no well-established guidelines for the recruitment and retention of female residents. APPROACH: To address challenges faced by female physicians and support the recruitment and retention of female residents, female emergency medicine residents and attending physicians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania formed a professional development group (PDG), #Shemergency, in July 2017. From July 2017 to July 2018, this PDG developed events and initiatives for female residents that addressed methods to improve awareness of and develop skills relevant to well-described gender disparities in mentorship, speakership and conference representation, compensation, evaluations, wellness and service, and award recognition. OUTCOMES: Over its first year (July 2017-July 2018), the PDG created a professional community and enhanced mentorship through a number of events and initiatives. The PDG secured funding for 5 residents to attend a national conference and nominated 5 residents and 2 attending physicians for professional organization awards (4 nominees won). NEXT STEPS: After the first year, the PDG expanded the number of joint activities with both male and female colleagues and organized a citywide event for female residents and faculty representing 5 different residency programs.

"Trends in Tenure Status in Academic Family Medicine, 1977-2017: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and the Academic Mission.",Xierali IM; Nivet MA; Syed ZA; Shakil A; Schneider FD,"PURPOSE: Tenure status has important implications for medical school faculty recruitment and retention and may affect educational quality, academic freedom, and collegiality. However, tenure trends in academic family medicine are unknown. This study aimed to describe trends in tenure status of family medicine faculty overall and by gender and status of minorities underrepresented in medicine (URM) in Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited medical schools. METHOD: Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster data were used to describe trends in tenure status of full-time family medicine faculty, 1977 to 2017. Bivariate and trend analyses were conducted to assess associations and describe patterns between tenure status and gender, race, and ethnicity. Interdepartmental variations in tenure trends over the years were also examined. RESULTS: Among family medicine faculty, the proportions of faculty tenured or on a tenure track dropped more than threefold from 1977 (46.6%; n = 507/1,089) to 2017 (12.7%; n = 729/5,752). Lower proportions of women and URM faculty were tenured or on a tenure track than male and non-URM faculty, respectively. But the gaps among them were converging.

The role of rural communities in the recruitment and retention of women physicians.,Paladine HL; Hustedde C; Wendling A; Sola O; Prasad R; Bjorkman S; Phillips J,"Rural communities in the United States have a shortage of primary care physicians. Women physicians are more likely than male physicians to choose primary care specialties but less likely to locate in rural areas. With an increasing proportion of women physicians, it is important to understand community characteristics that encourage their recruitment and retention. This qualitative study explored community characteristics that influenced successful rural practice. We conducted telephone interviews with 25 women family physicians in rural practice in the United States in 2012. Interviews continued until saturation of themes was reached. Data were analyzed using immersion and crystallization. Community themes associated with successful rural practice included: fit with the community; spouse/partner fit with the community; relationships with individuals; and relationships with the community. Family ties, training experience within the community, social networks, and investment in the community were positive factors, while political/cultural differences were negative. Community integration arose from compatibility between the physicians' goals and community characteristics, opportunities for a spouse/partner, friendships, and a feeling of community purpose. This information can be used by rural communities to recruit and retain physicians, and by physicians, medical students, and those who advise them to promote successful rural practice.",2020,Jan,Women Health,60,1,113-122,,10.1080/03630242.2019.1607801,31035912,#69,Paladine 2020,"",""

Recruitment via social media: advantages and potential biases.,Benedict C; Hahn AL; Diefenbach MA; Ford JS,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors are under-represented in research. Social media is increasingly used for recruitment given its ability to reach large audiences. Differences in participant characteristics and potential biases due to recruitment source are not well understood. PURPOSE: This study aimed to: (a) compare recruitment strategies (hospital-based v. social media) in enrollment metrics, and (b) among enrolled participants, evaluate group differences in patient characteristics and patient reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: Preliminary data from a cancer and fertility study with female AYAs were evaluated. Hospital-based recruitment used electronic medical records (EMR) to identify eligible patients. Social media recruitment involved posting on partner organizations' social media outlets. PROs included validated measures related to the parent study. Descriptive statistics evaluated recruitment metrics. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square identified differences in participant characteristics and PROs based on recruitment. RESULTS: Social media yielded a higher enrollment rate (37%; n = 54/146) compared with hospital-based recruitment (7%; n = 21/289) and required fewer study resources. Compared with hospital-based recruitment, participants from social media were more likely to be White (p = 0.01), with a longer time since treatment (p = 0.03); and reported higher levels of reproductive concern (p = 0.004) and negative mood (p = 0.02), and more negative illness perceptions (ps < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Recruitment via social media may be a more effective and efficient strategy compared with hospital-based methods.

Building High-Performing Teams in Academic Surgery: The Opportunities and Challenges of Inclusive Recruitment Strategies.,Dossett LA; Mulholland MW; Newman EA,"PROBLEM: In academic surgery, women and physicians from ethnic minority groups remain inadequately represented relative to their representation in the U.S. population and among medical students and surgical trainees. Although several initiatives have been aimed at developing the academic surgery pipeline or addressing issues related to faculty retention and promotion, little is known about how recruitment practices impact diversity in academic medicine. Moreover, national standards and ideal practices specific for effective recruitment in surgery have not been established. APPROACH: A working group at the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan implemented an inclusive search and selection process for all open faculty positions within the department in academic year 2017-2018. The strategy included mandatory training, a standing recruitment committee with diverse membership, broad promotion of positions, implementing a modified ""Rooney rule,"" panel interviews of candidates, standardized interview protocols, a standardized evaluation tool and scoring system, and written evaluations/ranking of candidates. OUTCOMES: Implementation of this recruitment strategy resulted in several immediate measurable benefits including increased diversity of the applicant pools and of new faculty hires. In addition to these positive effects, the department noted several knowledge gaps and faced challenges to implementing all elements of the strategy. NEXT STEPS: The authors share their framework, highlighting opportunities and challenges that are broadly generalizable and relevant for building high-performing teams in academic medicine. Work to set measurable metrics and address challenges for inclusive recruitment in surgery is ongoing.

Strategies for recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for a clinical trial.,Huang B; De Vore D; Chirinos C; Wolf J; Low D; Willard-Grace R; Tsao S; Garvey C; Donesky D; Su G; Thom DH,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment and retention are two significant barriers in research, particularly for historically underrepresented groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, patients who are low-income, or people with substance use or mental health issues. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death and disproportionately affects many underrepresented groups. The lack of representation of these groups in research limits the generalizability and applicability of clinical research and results. In this paper we describe our experience and rates of recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups for the Aides in Respiration (AIR) COPD Health Coaching Study. METHODS: A priori design strategies included minimizing exclusion criteria, including patients in the study process, establishing partnerships with the community clinics, and ensuring that the health coaching intervention was flexible enough to accommodate patient needs. RESULTS: Challenges to recruitment included lack of spirometric data in patient records, space constraints at the clinic sites, barriers to patient access to clinic sites, lack of current patient contact information and poor patient health. Of 282 patients identified as eligible, 192 (68%) were enrolled in the study and 158 (82%) completed the study. Race, gender, educational attainment, severity of disease, health literacy, and clinic site were not associated with recruitment or retention. However, older patients were less likely to enroll in the study and patients who used home oxygen or had more than one hospitalization during the study period were less likely to complete the study. Three key strategies to maximize recruitment and retention were identified during the study: incorporating the patient perspective, partnering with the community clinics, and building patient rapport. CONCLUSIONS: While the AIR study included design features to maximize the recruitment and retention of patients from underrepresented groups, additional challenges were encountered and responded to during the study. We also identified three key strategies recommended for future studies of COPD and similar conditions. Incorporating the approaches described into future studies may increase participation rates from underrepresented groups, providing results that can be more accurately applied to patients who carry a disparate burden of disease.

"Digital Media Recruitment for Fall Prevention Among Older Chinese-American Individuals: Observational, Cross-Sectional Study.",Lam NH; Woo BK,"BACKGROUND: Research in fall prevention programs has increased in recent years in response to the aging demographics of the United States. To date, limited research and outreach programs have focused on ethnic minorities due to increased cost, language barriers, and cultural differences. Digital media platforms may be a cost-effective avenue to initiate fall prevention programs for minority populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether Facebook advertisements are a practical recruitment method for health education to the Chinese-speaking population. METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional study. We uploaded a video on fall education on YouTube and initiated an advertisement campaign on Facebook that was linked to the video. The target population was older adults aged >45 years who used Facebook and were presented with the advertisement (N=1039). We recorded metrics such as the number of unique individuals reached, the number of views of the advertisement, the number of clicks, user gender and age, and traffic sources to the advertisement. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Our Facebook advertisement had 1087 views (1039 unique viewers). There were 121 link clicks with a click-through rate of 11.13% (121/1087). The cost per link click was approximately US $0.06. Among the viewers, 91.41% (936/1024) were females and 8.59% (88/1024) were males. In the 45-54 age group, the ad reached 50 people, with 1 link click (2.00%). In the 55-64 age group, the ad reached 572 people, with 57 link clicks (9.97%). In the ≥65 age group, the ad reached 417 people, with 63 link clicks (15.11%). CONCLUSIONS: Facebook was able to directly target the advertisement to the desired older ethnic population at a low cost. Engagement was highest among females and among those aged ≥65 years. Hence, our results suggest that Facebook can serve as an alternative platform for dissemination of health information to geriatric patients in addition to print-based and face-to-face communication.",2018,Nov,JMIR Aging,1,2,e11772,,10.2196/11772,31518249,#74,Lam 2018,"",""
Impact of informed consent content and length on recruitment of older adults into a community based primary prevention trial.,O'Hare F; Spark S; Flanagan Z; Heritier S; Curtis A; Zoungas S,"AIMS: To compare recruitment, refusal and randomisation rates of older adults into a general practice-based clinical trial with two versions (varied format, content and language) of the Participant Information and Consent Form (PICF). METHODS: This prospective PICF study was conducted within the STAREE (STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly) clinical trial. Participants phone screened between October 2015 to February 2016 formed Group 1 and were mailed the extended PICF version and participants phone screened between October 2016 to February 2017 formed Group 2 and were mailed the shortened PICF version. Participants who attended a subsequent baseline screening visit were guided through a comprehensive informed consent process. RESULTS: During the screening phase of the trial, the likelihood of refusing trial participation was lower in Group 2 compared to Group 1 equating to an overall 23% reduction in risk (RR 0.77, P = 0.005, 95% CI 0.62-0.95). Group 2 had a 6.4% higher randomisation rate compared with Group 1 (65.3% versus 58.9% respectively) but this difference was not statistically significant. Factors associated with trial participation were male gender, age between 70 and 75 years and living alone (all p < .0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst avoiding lengthy and complex PICF documents may assist with initial trial engagement, it needs to be supplemented with other strategies to support ongoing trial interest to randomisation and beyond.

Visualization of macrophage recruitment in head and neck carcinoma model using fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging.,Khurana A; Chapelin F; Xu H; Acevedo JR; Molinolo A; Nguyen Q; Ahrens ET,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of infiltrating macrophages in murine models of single and double mutation head and neck tumors using a novel fluorine-19 ((19) F) MRI technology. METHODS: Tumor cell lines single-hit/SCC4 or double-hit/Cal27, with mutations of TP53 and TP53 & FHIT, respectively, were injected bilaterally into the flanks of (n = 10) female mice. With tumors established, perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion was injected intravenously, which labels in situ predominantly monocytes and macrophages. Longitudinal spin density-weighted (19) F MRI data enabled quantification of the macrophage burden in tumor and surrounding tissue. RESULTS: The average number of (19) F atoms within the tumors was twice as high in the Cal27 group compared with SCC4 (3.9 × 10(19) and 2.0 × 10(19)(19) F/tumor, respectively; P = 0.0034) two days after contrast injection, signifying increased tumor-associated macrophages in double-hit tumors. The difference was still significant 10 days after injection. Histology stains correlated with in vivo results, exhibiting numerous perfluorocarbon-labeled macrophages in double-hit tumors and to a lesser extent in single-hit tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This study helps to establish (19) F MRI as a method for quantifying immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, allowing distinction between double and single-hit head and neck tumors. This technique would be extremely valuable in the clinic for pretreatment planning, prognostics, and post-treatment surveillance.

"Challenges in Recruiting, Retaining and Promoting Racially and Ethnically Diverse Faculty.",Kaplan SE; Gunn CM; Kulukulualani AK; Raj A; Freund KM; Carr PL,"BACKGROUND: Despite individual and institutional awareness of the inequity in retention, promotion and leadership of racially and ethnically underrepresented minority faculty in academic medicine, the number of such faculty remains unacceptably low. The authors explored challenges to the recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented faculty among a sample of leaders at academic medical centers. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted from 2011 to 2012 with 44 senior faculty leaders, predominantly members of the Group on Diversity and Inclusion (GDI) and/or the Group on Women in Medical Sciences (GWIMS), at the 24 randomly selected medical schools of the National Faculty Survey of 1995. All institutions were in the continental United States and balanced across public/private status and geographic region. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and organized into content areas before conducting inductive thematic analysis. Themes expressed by multiple informants were studied for patterns of association. RESULTS: The climate for underrepresented minority faculty was described as neutral to positive. Three consistent themes were identified regarding the challenges to recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented faculty: 1) the continued lack of a critical mass of minority faculty; 2) the need for coordinated programmatic efforts and resources necessary to address retention and promotion; and 3) the need for a senior leader champion.

mHealth Intervention Promoting Cardiovascular Health Among African-Americans: Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics of a Pilot Study.,Brewer LC; Jenkins S; Lackore K; Johnson J; Jones C; Cooper LA; Radecki Breitkopf C; Hayes SN; Patten C,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are promising avenues to promote cardiovascular (CV) health among African-Americans (AAs) and culturally tailored technology-based interventions are emerging for this population. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to recruit AAs into a pilot intervention study of an innovative mHealth CV health promotion program and to characterize technology use patterns and eHealth literacy (EHL). METHODS: Community partners from five predominately AA churches in southeast Minnesota collaborated with our academic institution to recruit AA congregants into the pilot study. Field notes as well as communications between the study team and community partners were used to design the recruitment strategy and its implementation with a goal of enrolling 50 participants. At its core, the recruitment strategy included community kickoff events to detail the state-of-the-art nature of the mHealth intervention components, the utility of CV health assessments (physical examination, laboratory studies and surveys) and the participants' role in advancing our understanding of the efficacy of mHealth interventions among racial/ethnic minority groups. Detailed recruitment data were documented throughout the study. A self-administered, electronic survey measured sociodemographics, technology use and EHL (eHEALS scale). RESULTS: A total of 50 participants (70% women) from five AA churches were recruited over a one-month period. The majority (>90%) of participants reported using some form of mobile technology with all utilizing these technologies within their homes. Greater than half (60% [30/50]) reported being ""very comfortable"" with mobile technologies. Overall, participants had high EHL (84.8% [39/46] with eHEALS score ≥26) with no differences by sex.

Written versus verbal consent: a qualitative study of stakeholder views of consent procedures used at the time of recruitment into a peripartum trial conducted in an emergency setting.,Lawton J; Hallowell N; Snowdon C; Norman JE; Carruthers K; Denison FC,"BACKGROUND: Obtaining prospective written consent from women to participate in trials when they are experiencing an obstetric emergency is challenging. Alternative consent pathways, such as gaining verbal consent at enrolment followed, later, by obtaining written consent, have been advocated by some clinicians and bioethicists but have received little empirical attention. We explored women's and staff views about the consent procedures used during the internal pilot of a trial (GOT-IT), where the protocol permitted staff to gain verbal consent at recruitment. METHODS: Interviews with staff (n = 27) and participating women (n = 22). Data were analysed thematically and interviews were cross-compared to identify differences and similarities in participants' views about the consent procedures used. RESULTS: Women and some staff highlighted benefits to obtaining verbal consent at trial enrolment, including expediting recruitment and reducing the burden on those left exhausted by their births. However, most staff with direct responsibility for taking consent expressed extreme reluctance to proceed with enrolment until they had obtained written consent, despite being comfortable using verbal procedures in their clinical practice. To account for this resistance, staff drew a strong distinction between research and clinical care and suggested that a higher level of consent was needed when recruiting into trials. In doing so, staff emphasised the need to engage women in reflexive decision-making and highlighted the role that completing the consent form could play in enabling and evidencing this process. While most staff cited their ethical responsibilities to women, they also voiced concerns that the absence of a signed consent form at recruitment could expose them to greater risk of litigation were an individual to experience a complication during the trial. Inexperience of recruiting into peripartum trials and limited availability of staff trained to take consent also reinforced preferences for obtaining written consent at recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: While alternative consent pathways have an important role to play in advancing emergency medicine research, and may be appreciated by potential recruits, they may give rise to unintended ethical and logistical challenges for staff. Staff would benefit from training and support to increase their confidence and willingness to recruit into trials using alternative consent pathways.

"Evaluating a Medical School's Climate for Women's Success: Outcomes for Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion.",Villablanca AC; Li Y; Beckett LA; Howell LP,"OBJECTIVE: Women are under-represented in academia. Causative factors include challenges of career-family integration. We evaluated factors reflecting institutional culture (promotion, retention, hiring, and biasing language in promotion letters) as part of an intervention to help shift culture and raise awareness of flexibility policies at the University of California, Davis (UCD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on faculty use of family-friendly policies were obtained at baseline, and surveys for policy awareness were conducted pre(2010)/post(2013) an NIH-funded study educational intervention. Data on hires, separations, and promotions were obtained pre(2007-2009, 2234 person-year data points)/post(2010-2012, 2384 person-year data points) intervention and compared by logistic regression and for gender differences. Department promotion letters (53) were also analyzed for biasing language. RESULTS: Policy use was overall low, highest for female assistant professors, and for maternity leave. Awareness significantly increased for all policies postintervention. Promotions decreased, likely because of increases in advancement deferrals or tenure clock extensions. Pre/postintervention, female and male hires were near parity for assistant professors, but female hires were substantially lower than males for associate (54% less likely, p = 0.03) and full professors (70% less likely, p = 0.002). Once hired, women were no more likely to separate than men. Fewer associate/full professors separated than assistant professors (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively), regardless of gender. Language in promotion letters was not gender biased. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a shift at UCD toward a culture of work-life flexibility, an environment in which letters of recommendation show very few biased descriptions, and in which assistant professor hiring is gender equitable. At the same time, a decrease in number of faculty members applying for promotion and an imbalance of men over women at senior hires independent of policy awareness may challenge the assumption that family-friendly policies, while promoting flexibility, also have a positive impact on professional advancement.",2017,May,J Womens Health (Larchmt),26,5,530-539,,10.1089/jwh.2016.6018,28170291,#80,Villablanca 2017,"",""
"Recruitment, Promotion, and Retention of Women in Academic Medicine: How Institutions Are Addressing Gender Disparities.",Carr PL; Gunn C; Raj A; Kaplan S; Freund KM,"OBJECTIVE: Greater numbers of women in medicine have not resulted in more women achieving senior positions. Programs supporting the recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine could help to achieve greater advancement of more women to leadership positions. Qualitative research was conducted to understand such programs at 23 institutions and, using the social ecological model, examine how they operate at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with faculty representatives (n = 44) of the Group on Women in Medicine and Science, Diversity and Inclusion, or senior leaders with knowledge on gender climate in 24 medical schools. Four trained interviewers conducted semistructured interviews that addressed faculty perceptions of gender equity and advancement, which were audiotaped and transcribed. The data were categorized into three content areas-recruitment, promotion, and retention-and coded a priori for each area based on their social ecological level of operation. FINDINGS: Participants from nearly 40% of the institutions reported no special programs for recruiting, promoting, or retaining women, largely describing such programming as unnecessary. Existing programs primarily targeted the individual and interpersonal levels simultaneously, via training, mentoring, and networking, or the institutional level, via search committee trainings, child and elder care, and spousal hiring programs. Lesser effort at the academic community and policy levels were described. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that many U.S. medical schools have no programs supporting gender equity among medical faculty. Existing programs primarily target the individual or interpersonal level of the social ecological interaction. The academic community and broader policy environment require greater focus as levels with little attention to advancing women's careers.

Assessment of Factors for Recruiting and Retaining Medical Students to Rural Communities Using the Community Apgar Questionnaire.,Reed AJ; Schmitz D; Baker E; Girvan J; McDonald T,"BACKGROUND: Rural communities throughout the United States are eager to recruit and retain family physicians. This study examined factors that may contribute to a medical student's decision to consider rural family medicine practice using the Community Apgar Questionnaire (CAQ). METHODS: Third- and fourth-year medical students from 10 medical schools responded to a survey of 62 identified factors deemed to be present when assessing the strengths and challenges of recruiting family physicians to rural communities. Participants could also respond to six demographic questions. Factors were ranked based on importance to respondents and were compared using demographic information. RESULTS: A total of 282 MS-3 and MS-4 students interested in family medicine from 10 US medical schools completed the survey (response rate 19.5%). Forty percent of participants anticipate practicing in a rural setting, followed by 31% for suburban and 29% for urban. The top three factors participants considered when anticipating a rural practice setting were spousal satisfaction, call frequency, and competition/collegiality. Additional differences were found across CAQ factors by future practice setting, gender, and location where the student was raised.

It takes two: A dyadic model of recruitment to civic activity.,Beyerlein K; Bergstrand K,"Why are some people, but not others, asked to engage in civic activity? Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity-blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism-allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics-such as romantic partnerships-promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others-such as sex homophily-are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.",2016,Nov,Soc Sci Res,60,,163-180,,10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.07.008,27712677,#83,Beyerlein 2016,"",""

There are few guidelines in place defining organization-level factors that promote a supportive workplace environment beneficial to women in emergency medicine (EM). We assembled a working group with the goal of developing specific and feasible recommendations to support women's professional development in both community and academic EM settings. METHODS: We formed a working group from the leadership of two EM women's organizations, the Academy of Women in Academic Emergency Medicine (AWAEM) and the American Association of Women Emergency Physicians (AAWEP). Through a literature search and discussion, working group members identified four domains where organizational policies and practices supportive of women were needed: 1) global approaches to supporting the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in EM; 2) recruitment, hiring, and compensation of women emergency physicians; 3) supporting development and advancement of women in EM; and 4) physician health and wellness (in the context of pregnancy, childbirth, and maternity leave). Within each of these domains, the working group created an initial set of specific recommendations. The working group then recruited a stakeholder group of EM physician leaders across the country, selecting for diversity in practice setting, geographic location, age, race, and gender. Stakeholders were asked to score and provide feedback on each of the recommendations. Specific recommendations were retained by the working group if they achieved high rates of approval from the stakeholder group for importance and perceived feasibility. Those with >80% agreement on importance and >50% agreement on feasibility were retained. Finally, recommendations were posted in an open online forum (blog) and invited public commentary. RESULTS: An initial set of 29 potential recommendations was created by the working group. After stakeholder voting and feedback, 16 final recommendations were retained. Recommendations were refined through qualitative comments from stakeholders and blog respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Using a consensus building process that included male and female stakeholders from both academic and community EM settings, we developed recommendations for organizations to implement to create a workplace environment supportive of women in EM that were perceived as acceptable and feasible.

Effect of characteristics of women on attendance in blind and non-blind randomised trials: analysis of recruitment data from the EPHT Trial.,Veerus P; Fischer K; Hemminki E; Hovi SL; Hakama M,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of women's characteristics on their willingness to join a blind or a non-blind subtrial or to be excluded by physicians. DESIGN: Primary prevention trial of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). A 2×2, randomised design with a non-blind HT arm or control arm and a blind HT arm or placebo arm. SETTING: 3 clinical centres in Estonia. METHODS: Interest in joining the trial was asked in a questionnaire together with demographic and health status data. Interested and eligible women were invited to a health examination that also informed whether they belonged to a blind or to a non-blind subtrial; the arm was not revealed. Trial physicians made further exclusions when checking the women's eligibility. Thereafter, informed consent was asked as detailed in the flow chart. Comparisons were made between non-blind and blind subtrials. Analyses were carried out for each of the background variables. OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of willingness, eligibility and attendance. RESULTS: Women randomised to the non-blind subtrial were more willing to join (relative risk (RR) 1.17) and more likely to be found eligible by physicians (RR 1.10) than women in the blind subtrial, resulting in larger attendance (RR 1.29). Women with higher education were differentially more willing to join the non-blind trial (RR 1.29) than those with basic education (RR 1.08); the differential willingness of never-smokers (RR 1.20) was larger than that of current smokers (RR 1.07). The differential exclusion by physicians by education and smoking were small. Some subjective symptoms (eg, diarrhoea/constipation, stomach pain) had reverse differential effects on attendance in the non-blind subtrial in comparison to the blind subtrial. Menopausal symptoms did not affect the differential interest, eligibility or attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Blinding in RCT reduces attendance, due to decisions of the women and the trial physicians. Differential attendance by blinding may affect the generalisability of the results from trials.

The Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure Study (InterGEN): Design and Methods for Recruitment and Psychological Measures.,Crusto CA; Barcelona de Mendoza V; Connell CM; Sun YV; Taylor JY,"BACKGROUND: Although studies show that genomics and environmental stressors affect blood pressure, few studies have examined their combined effects, especially in African Americans. OBJECTIVE: We present the recruitment methods and psychological measures of the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) study, which seeks to investigate the individual and combined effects of genetic (G) and environmental (E) (psychological) stressors on blood pressure in African American mother-child dyads. Genetic methods are presented elsewhere, but here we present the recruitment methods, psychological measures, and analysis plan for these environmental stressors. METHODS: This longitudinal study will enroll 250 mother-child dyads (N = 500). Study participation is restricted to women who (a) are ≤21 years of age, (b) self-identify as African American or Black, (c) speak English, (d) do not have an identified mental illness or cognitive impairment, and (e) have a biological child between 3 and 5 years old. The primary environmental stressors assessed are parenting stress, perceived racism and discrimination, and maternal mental health. Covariates include age, cigarette smoking (for mothers), and gender (for children). The study outcome variables are systolic and diastolic blood pressure. ANALYSIS: The main analytic outcome is genetic-by-environment interaction analyses (G × E); however, main effects (G) and (E) will be individually assessed first. Genetic (G) and interaction analyses (G × E) are described in a companion paper and will include laboratory procedures. Statistical modeling of environmental stressors on blood pressure will be done using descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation models. IMPLICATIONS: The methodology presented here includes the study rationale, community engagement and recruitment protocol, psychological variable measurement, and analysis plan for assessing the association of environmental stressors and blood pressure.

The Recruitment Experience of a Randomized Clinical Trial to Aid Young Adult Smokers to Stop Smoking without Weight Gain with Interactive Technology.,Coday M; Richey P; Thomas F; Tran QT; Terrell SB; Tylavsky F; Miro D; Caufield M; Johnson KC,"Multiple recruitment strategies are often needed to recruit an adequate number of participants, especially hard to reach groups. Technology-based recruitment methods hold promise as a more robust form of reaching and enrolling historically hard to reach young adults. The TARGIT study is a randomized two-arm clinical trial in young adults using interactive technology testing an efficacious proactive telephone Quitline versus the Quitline plus a behavioral weight management intervention focusing on smoking cessation and weight change. All randomized participants in the TARGIT study were required to be a young adult smoker (18-35 years), who reported smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day, had a BMI < 40 kg/m(2,) and were willing to stop smoking and not gain weight. Traditional recruitment methods were compared to technology-based strategies using standard descriptive statistics based on counts and proportions to describe the recruitment process from initial pre-screening (PS) to randomization into TARGIT. Participants at PS were majority Black (59.80%), female (52.66%), normal or over weight (combined 62.42%), 29.5 years old, and smoked 18.4 cigarettes per day. There were differences in men and women with respect to reasons for ineligibility during PS (p < 0.001; ignoring gender specific pregnancy-related ineligibility). TARGIT experienced a disproportionate loss of minorities during recruitment as well as a prolonged recruitment period due to either study ineligibility or not completing screening activities.

"Women have substantial advantage in STEM faculty hiring, except when competing against more-accomplished men.",Ceci SJ; Williams WM,"Audits of tenure-track hiring reveal faculty prefer to hire female applicants over males. However, audit data do not control for applicant quality, allowing some to argue women are hired at higher rates because they are more qualified. To test this, Williams and Ceci (2015) conducted an experiment demonstrating a preference for hiring women over identically-qualified men. While their findings are consistent with audits, they raise the specter that faculty may prefer women over even more-qualified men, a claim made recently. We evaluated this claim in the present study: 158 faculty ranked two men and one woman for a tenure-track-assistant professorship, and 94 faculty ranked two women and one man. In the former condition, the female applicant was slightly weaker than her two male competitors, although still strong; in the other condition the male applicant was slightly weaker than his two female competitors, although still strong. Faculty of both genders and in all fields preferred the more-qualified men over the slightly-less-qualified women, and they also preferred the stronger women over the slightly-less-qualified man. This suggests that preference for women among identically-qualified applicants found in experimental studies and in audits does not extend to women whose credentials are even slightly weaker than male counterparts. Thus these data give no support to the twin claims that weaker males are chosen over stronger females or weaker females are hired over stronger males.",2015,,Front Psychol,6,,1532,,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01532,26539132,#88,Ceci 2015,"",""
Quality of life outcomes in women with endometriosis are highly influenced by recruitment strategies.,De Graaff AA; Dirksen CD; Simoens S; De Bie B; Hummelshoj L; D'Hooghe TM; Dunselman GA,"STUDY QUESTION: To what extent are outcome measures in endometriosis-related quality of life studies influenced by the setting in which patient recruitment is performed? SUMMARY ANSWER: Quality of life outcomes in women with endometriosis are highly influenced by recruitment strategies. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most studies on quality of life in women with endometriosis are conducted in tertiary care centres or patient associations. It is conceivable that the setting in which patient recruitment is performed influences the quality of life results. This has not been investigated before. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective questionnaire based cohort study (part of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) EndoCost study). The investigated women were recruited in three settings: a tertiary care centre for endometriosis (n = 135); five secondary care centres (n = 63); an endometriosis patient association (n = 291). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The secondary and tertiary care population included women with a laparoscopic and/or histological diagnosis of endometriosis. The patient association population consisted of women with a self-reported diagnosis of surgically confirmed endometriosis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The populations did not differ in terms of age, co-morbidities and education level. Delay of diagnosis was the longest in the patient association (median 7 years) (tertiary care 2 years; secondary care 1.5 years) (P < 0.001). The tertiary care population reported more laparotomies (64%) than the other populations (secondary care 43%; patient association 47%) (P = 0.002). Affected job was least prevalent in the secondary care setting (35%) (patient association 64%; tertiary care 56%) (P < 0.001). Affected relationships were most prevalent in the patient association setting (52%) (tertiary care 38%; secondary care 22%) (P < 0.001). Chronic pain was least prevalent in patients in secondary care (44%) (tertiary care 65%; patient association 61%) (P = 0.009). Substantial differences in quality of life were detected between secondary care (median physical component 50.4, mental component 49.6); tertiary care (physical component 46.2, mental component 46.2) and the patient association (physical component 45.0, mental component 44.6) (P < 0.001, P = 0.018). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The response rate was relatively low (35%). Analysis of the hospital populations revealed that non-responders and responders did not differ with respect to age or revised American Fertility Society classification, indicating that the non-responder bias is limited. However, other factors, such as social and marital status or symptomatology, might be different for non-responders. Missing values were analysed as if the symptom was not present. Missing values never exceeded 10%, except for one value. Therefore, it can be expected that the effect of missing data on the outcome is negligible. Twenty-five patients belonged to more than one category. A sensitivity analysis showed that the influence of assigning patients to another category was limited. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Outcomes regarding quality of life are highly influenced by recruitment strategy. None of the groups appeared to be a representative selection of the total population of women with endometriosis. An alternative strategy for creating a representative population for cost and quality of life studies is probably to recruit women who live in a specific geographic area rather than women that visit a specific hospital or are a member of a patient association.

National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track.,Williams WM; Ceci SJ,"National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non-math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.",2015,Apr,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,112,17,5360-5,,10.1073/pnas.1418878112,25870272,#90,Williams 2015,"",""
Recruiting migrants for health research through social network sites: an online survey among chinese migrants in australia.,Hu J; Wong KC; Wang Z,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, postal surveys or face to face interviews are the main approaches for health researchers to obtain essential research data. However, with the prevalence of information technology and Internet, Web-based surveys are gaining popularity in health research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report the process and outcomes of recruiting Chinese migrants through social network sites in Australia and to examine the sample characteristics of online recruitment by comparing the sample which was recruited by an online survey to a sample of Australian Chinese migrants collected by a postal survey. METHODS: Descriptive analyses were performed to describe and compare the process and outcomes of online recruitment with postal survey questionnaires. Chi square tests and t tests were performed to assess the differences between the two samples for categorical and continuous variables respectively. RESULTS: In total, 473 Chinese migrants completed the online health survey from July to October 2013. Out of 426 participants recruited through the three Chinese social network sites in Australia, over 86.6% (369/426) were recruited within six weeks. Participants of the Web-based survey were younger, with a higher education level or had resided in Australia for less time compared to those recruited via a postal survey. However, there was no significant difference in gender, marital status, and professional occupation. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of Chinese migrants through social network sites in our online survey was feasible. Compared to a postal survey of Chinese migrants, the online survey attracted different group of Chinese migrants who may have diverse health needs and concerns. Our findings provided insightful information for researchers who are considering employing a Web-based approach to recruit migrants and ethnic minority participants.",2015,Apr,JMIR Res Protoc,4,2,e46,,10.2196/resprot.3960,25917837,#91,Hu 2015,"",""
Using PhenX toolkit measures and other tools to assess urban/rural differences in health behaviors: recruitment methods and outcomes.,Hitz MM; Conway PG; Palcher JA; McCarty CA,"BACKGROUND: The overall study was designed to examine how vacation behavior affects rural and urban Minnesotans and North Dakotans. The purpose of this substudy was to describe the method for sampling, follow-up and response rate by gender and urban/rural location to help inform future studies in this population. METHODS: Essentia health primary care patients (n=1344) were sent a 21-page self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, work history, perceived stress, work productivity, depression and mania screeners, tobacco use, dietary information, vacation habits, and technology use. Participants were offered $10 to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall response to the three mailings to 1344 adults aged 25-64 was 38.8% for a final sample size of 522 completed surveys. Despite the oversampling of males, the total number of responses from males was lower than for females. The response rates between urban and rural locations were nearly identical for the males (33.3% and 33.0% respectively) but higher for rural females than urban females (47.2% and 42.6% respectively). Seventy-eight percent were currently employed. Sixty-nine percent of the participants reported being married, 5.4% were living with a partner, 14% were divorced widowed or separated and 11% were never married.

Enhanced research assessment performance in graduate vs. undergraduate-entry medical students: implications for recruitment into academic medicine.,Duggan EM; O'Tuathaigh CM; Horgan M; O'Flynn S,"BACKGROUND: Studies investigating variance between the academic performance of direct-entry (DEM) versus graduate-entry (GEM) medical students have yielded conflicting results, but their performance in undergraduate research-based assessments has not been compared to-date. AIM: We aimed to compare the results of DEM and GEM students with respect to their senior research dissertation module. METHODS: This retrospective study examined the final year results between 2011-2012 in DEM, (n = 219) and GEM (n = 84) students. Between-group comparisons of dissertation module marks were conducted using independent t-tests. Correlations between marks in dissertation module and in other disciplines assessed during the final year were attained using Pearson's correlation. Multiple regression analysis was employed to adjust for potential confounding factors such as student age and gender. RESULTS: No apparent difference was apparent between the DEM and GEM students with respect to results achieved across the clinical disciplines examined. However, GEM students performed significantly better than DEMs in their senior research dissertation assessment (Mean = 66.81% vs. 65.00%, fully adjusted p = 0.048). The variable which remained influential in regression analysis was nationality, where North American and Asian students were demonstrated to score lower than their Irish counterparts in the dissertation module (B coefficient = -1.90, SE = 0.94, P = 0.045 and B coefficient = -4.88, SE = 1.00, P < 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Performance in the research-based module was significantly better in GEM relative to their DEM colleagues.

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 116 sequential patients with severe ARDS to the intervention group (which undergo prone-positioning with RM sessions of at least 10 hours) or to the control group (which be left in the supine position). RESULTS: From July 2012 to July 2013, 116 severe ARDS patients sequentially admitted to the critical department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled in the study with 60 patients assigned to the control group and 56 patients to the intervention group. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the demographics including the median patient age, sex ratio, initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, initial pulmonary function and the sources of ARDS. The oxygenation index recorded in the supine position was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group since day 3, whereas the positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired O2 were significantly lower in the intervention group. The plateau pressure and static compliance of the respiratory system were similar in the two groups. The intervention group had shorter length of ICU stay, fewer ventilation days and decreased 28-day mortality than the control group. The tracheotomy ratio and the time to successful extubation were similar in the two groups. No significant difference between the two groups was shown in the incidence of complications, except for the grade 1 pressure sore, which was higher in the intervention group.

Recruitment collapse and population structure of the European eel shaped by local ocean current dynamics.,Baltazar-Soares M; Biastoch A; Harrod C; Hanel R; Marohn L; Prigge E; Evans D; Bodles K; Behrens E; Böning CW; Eizaguirre C,"Worldwide, exploited marine fish stocks are under threat of collapse [1]. Although the drivers behind such collapses are diverse, it is becoming evident that failure to consider evolutionary processes in fisheries management can have drastic consequences on a species' long-term viability [2]. The European eel (Anguilla anguilla; Linnaeus, 1758) is no exception: not only does the steep decline in recruitment observed in the 1980s [3, 4] remain largely unexplained, the punctual detection of genetic structure also raises questions regarding the existence of a single panmictic population [5-7]. With its extended Transatlantic dispersal, pinpointing the role of ocean dynamics is crucial to understand both the population structure and the widespread decline of this species. Hence, we combined dispersal simulations using a half century of high-resolution ocean model data with population genetics tools. We show that regional atmospherically driven ocean current variations in the Sargasso Sea were the major driver of the onset of the sharp decline in eel recruitment in the beginning of the 1980s. The simulations combined with genotyping of natural coastal eel populations furthermore suggest that unexpected evidence of coastal genetic differentiation is consistent with cryptic female philopatric behavior within the Sargasso Sea. Such results demonstrate the key constraint of the variable oceanic environment on the European eel population.",2014,Jan,Curr Biol,24,1,104-108,,10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.031,24374306,#95,Baltazar-Soares 2014,"",""

Method: Using a case study method, data were collected over three-months through interviews, observations, course documents, student reflections, and researcher reflections. Constant comparative analysis was employed to analyze data throughout and following data generation. Findings: Recruitment and teacher support were key practices. Recruitment practices included letter writing campaigns and recruiting from introductory CS courses. Teacher support came from counselors, administrators, and other teachers. While the CS program was consistently more gender-inclusive, the focus when building the program had been on supporting ""all"" students, not only female students. Implications: Recruitment should be active and purposeful, but using academic indicators for targeted recruitment campaigns can limit student exposure.

"SAT Patterns and Engineering and Computer Science College Majors: An Intersectional, State-Level Study","Tan, Lin; Bradburn, Isabel S.; Knight, David B.; Kinoshita, Timothy; Grohs, Jacob","Background: Numerous efforts worldwide have been made to increase diversity in engineering and computer science (ECS), fields that pay well and promote upward mobility. However, in the United States (U.S.), females and students from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups (URM) still pursue ECS training far less than do their peers. The current study explored sex and racial/ethnic differences in ECS college enrollment as a function of math and verbal SAT score patterns (balanced or imbalanced) using an intersectional approach within a U.S. context. Data represented a census of students who took the SAT, graduated from all Virginia public high schools between 2006 and 2015, and enrolled in a 4-year college (N = 344,803). Results: Our findings show, within each sex, URM students were at least as likely as their non-URM peers to enroll in ECS programs when they scored within similar SAT score ranges. Students were more likely to enroll in ECS programs if their SAT profile favored math, compared to students with similar math and verbal SAT scores (balanced profile). This overall pattern is notably less pronounced for URM female students; their propensity to major in ECS appeared to be largely independent of verbal scores. Conclusions: Our findings inform strategies to diversify ECS enrollment. If programs continue to emphasize SAT scores during admission decisions or if more systemic issues of resource allocation in secondary schools are not addressed, other efforts to broaden participation in ECS programs may fall short of goals.

Science Teacher Preparation a Comparison of Noyce and Non-Noyce Scholarship Participation,"Porter, Jenna; Sessoms, Deidre; Buxner, Sanlyn","Although studies have been published that examine the effectiveness of large federal scholarship programs for recruiting new science teachers, few studies have examined whether new teachers recruited by these programs are as well prepared as those who were not recruited and supported by these scholarships. In an effort to address the discrepancy in preparation, we analyzed data from three previous National Science Foundation Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program grants and examined the relationship between Noyce support for science preservice teachers (PSTs) and three demographic characteristics, (a) gender, (b) race (those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [URiS]), and (c) socioeconomic status (Pell eligibility), as measured by a high-stakes teacher performance assessment, the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT). We found that science PSTs who receive Noyce support are better prepared to support their own students in academic language than those who do not receive Noyce support. We also found that, although there were no relationships between demographic characteristics and PST PACT scores, some differences existed between Noyce and non-Noyce PSTs within demographic categories, suggesting that Noyce PSTs are more prepared in the domain of academic language (if they are male or URiS) and in the domains of assessment and overall PACT average (if they are Pell eligible).",2022,,Teacher Education Quarterly,49,3,92-113,2860855566; EJ1361512,,,#245,Porter 2022,"",""
Inclusion of Women to ICT Engineering -- Lessons Learned,"Lagesen, Vivian Anette; Pettersen, Ivar; Berg, Line","This paper address how we may understand inclusion strategies designed to reduce the gender gap in higher education in engineering and ICT engineering in particular. Based on a case study of a long-term inclusion effort and statistics on recruitment and retainment, we argue that inclusion initiatives which address important inclusion needs and put down a substantial effort are likely to be successful. However, such changes seem to be not very sustainable, and need continuous effort. Based on our findings and a review of previous research we argue that inclusion efforts are instrumental in gaining a higher share of women in ICT, but that the win may be short-lived. We suggest that there is a need also to work for a higher share of women faculty to obtain more sustainable recruitment and retainment of women in ICT. Moreover, we found that the probability of dropout among men students was systematically reduced with increased gender balance, which indicates that more gender-balanced programs are more attractive to remain in for both men and women.",2022,,European Journal of Engineering Education,47,3,467-482,2732072745; EJ1348228,https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2021.1983774,,#246,Lagesen 2022,"",""

"Recruitment to STEM Studies: The Roles of Curriculum Reforms, Flexibility of Choice, and Attitudes","Mellander, Erik; Lind, Patrik","Many countries are trying to increase the recruitment to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) studies. Some have implemented curriculum reforms to this end, others may do so. Using experiences from curriculum reforms in Germany, the Netherlands and, in particular, Sweden, we consider a proposal from the Royal Society in England about a broader curriculum for 16-19-year-olds, involving more mathematics and science. In Sweden, a curriculum reform in 1995, for 16-20-year-olds, increased the academic content of vocational programmes, including mathematics and science, such that they provided eligibility to university studies. Another reform, in 2011, reinstated the distinctions between vocational and academic programmes and made courses yielding university eligibility compulsory for academic programmes only. Using longitudinal student population data for 1986-2017, we assess the reform outcomes through before-after comparisons. The 1995 reform was followed by ""decreased"" recruitment to STEM studies while the opposite was true for the 2011 reform. A reform in Germany requiring students to study more mathematics was not very successful, either. We connect the positive consequences following the 2011 reform to the extensive Swedish opportunities to change study path. Including the option to attend a 1-year 'add-on' education programme, enabling students with non-STEM upper secondary background to conduct STEM university studies, changes to STEM programmes dominate changes away from them. Accordingly, we recommend more, not less, flexibility in programme choice, preferably coupled with efforts to improve female STEM attitudes, which have proved effective in Sweden.",2021,,Review of Education,9,2,357-398,2550790438; EJ1298770,https://doi.org/10.1002/rev3.3262,,#248,Mellander 2021,"",""

"Undergraduate Research Experiences: Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions--A Case Study at a Hispanic-Serving Institution","Rodríguez Amaya, Laura; Betancourt, Tania; Collins, Kristina Henry; Hinojosa, Orlando; Corona, Carlos","Background: Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have been proposed as means to increase the retention and engagement of minority--and more specifically Hispanic--college students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. This study explores the impact of student characteristics such as gender, classification, ethnicity, and first-generation status on UREs of STEM students through four specific constructs that current literature deem particularly important: (1) research experiences, (2) mentoring experiences, (3) awareness of research opportunities and activities, and (4) perceptions on research. These constructs are here forth referred to as Experiences, Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions. The study was conducted at a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) in Texas, United States (U.S.), where the overall increase in enrollment has been driven by growth in Hispanic student numbers, reflecting the demographic shift of the state and the nation. Results: Participants were recruited to be part of a STEM open house. Thirty-five students participated in the Undergraduate Research Experiences: Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions Survey (URE MAPS). This exploratory case study sought to look at student characteristics such as gender, classification, ethnicity, and first-generation status as predictors of UREs. Results show that classification and ethnicity student characteristics are statistically significant predictors of UREs. Although gender and first-generation status regression analysis did not show statistically significant results, crosstabulations looking at correlation among variables yield interesting results. Seven percent of the female respondents responded that they ""somewhat agree"" with the statement that research is a lonely activity in comparison with 23% of males. The majority (60%) of all respondents who ""strongly agreed"" with the statement that ""research is only for future scientists"" were Hispanic, indicating a need to clarify such misconceptions to encourage Hispanic student participation. Most self-identified first-generation participants, of whom 80% were female, reported awareness of faculty research activities, again pointing out gender as an important factor among students' relationship with their professors. Although less than 23% of students noted current participation in mentorship, most of those did report positive impact of this relationship on their attitude and perspective toward their major. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size and inherent bias in the characteristics of the STEM open house participants, regression analysis informed by crosstabs analysis revealed some important findings. The research suggested higher-than-expected awareness of Latinos and first-generation students of institutional research activities; however, this awareness has not translated in engagement in research activities. The data also indicates the critical need for high-impact UREs and mentorship relationships, as well as for efforts to battle student preconceptions of who can benefit from such experiences. Although this case study focused on LatinX students (LatinX is a gender-neutral term for people of Latin American heritage used in the U.S.) in the U.S., retention of historically underrepresented students in STEM disciplines is a concern shared by many countries around the world. The successful recruitment, retention, and eventual success of students in STEM degrees depend greatly on the type of pathways and support that are offered. UREs might be one of those pathways.",2018,,International Journal of STEM Education,5,,1-13,2101394180; EJ1181968,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-018-0105-8,,#267,RodríguezAmaya 2018,"",""
"Students' Demographic, Academic Characteristics and Performance in Registered General Nursing Licensing Examination in Ghana","Doe, Patience Fakornam; Oppong, Elizabeth Agyeiwaa; Sarfo, Jacob Owusu","The decreasing performance of student nurses in the professional licensure examinations (LE) in Ghana is a major concern to stakeholders, especially at a time when the nurse-patient ratio stands at 1: 1500. The study sought to determine the effect of students' demographic and academic characteristics on performance in the Registered General Nursing (RGN) LE. A descriptive retrospective study was conducted using a researcher designed checklist to review the administrative and academic records of 324 nursing students who wrote the RGN LE between 2007 and 2012. A stratified sampling method was used to select the participants for the study. Chi-square statistics were used to determine the effect of the predictors: demographic characteristics, entry grade and Final Grade Point Average (FGPA) on the dependent variable (LE performance). The study revealed a relationship between gender and LE performance, residential status, entry grade and students' FGPA at the college. However, no significant relationship was found between the age of participants, subject background at high school and LE outcomes. We conclude that students' socio-demographic and academic characteristics such as gender, campus residential status, entry grade and FGPA influence the outcome of the final LE of RGN students. Consequently, priority should be given to applicants with high pre-entry aggregate during recruitment and on campus accommodation should be provided for all trainee nurses. Furthermore, weak students with low FGPA should be given special tuition before they are registered for the final LE to improve their outcomes",2018,,European Journal of Contemporary Education,7,1,73-81,2034281616; EJ1172931,,,#268,Doe 2018,"",""
Approaching Gender Equity in Academic Chemistry: Lessons Learned from Successful Female Chemists in the UK,"Miller-Friedmann, Jaimie; Childs, Ann; Hillier, Judith","The internationally acknowledged gender gap in science continues to be an unrelenting concern to science educators; aggregate data in the UK show that both recruitment and retention of women in academic science remain relatively low. Most published research focuses on women in the broad field of science, generates correlations or predictions, or examines the reasons why women do not participate in fields like physics or engineering. Previous work has not yet addressed how women have found ways to succeed in particular fields, such as chemistry, or how successful pathways may be applied to recruitment and retention efforts in those fields. This study investigated the experiences of successful British female chemists, in order to uncover coping mechanisms and commonalities that may illuminate obstacles and solutions particular to women in chemistry. Four case study semi-structured life history interviews with highly successful British female chemists revealed common experiences that helped the women in the study to succeed. Of these, two resonated with the literature: having an integrated support network, and the ability to cope with financial and career instability; choice of subfield and adaptation of (unconscious) bias are offered as new insights. The findings suggest changes in policy and practice that would provide particular kinds of support for women in chemistry at school and university level.

These factors include impact of school experience, personal choice of students, importance of subject area, experience as student in the subject, expectations of everyday life, educational status of students in the subject and priorities for future. This study also digs out the gender mean difference in the choice of subject. A structured questionnaire IRIS-Q was used containing items regarding the influence of various factors for the choice of STEM subjects. Only those students were the part of study that had completed their first year of education in any area of STEM in the public sector universities of Punjab. Results indicated that school experience was identified as an important factor for the selection of STEM subjects. Among the family and relatives the role of fathers was prominent in the choice of STEM areas. The role of media and technology had no significant role to motivate the students to choose the subjects. Students' learning endeavours played an effective role for the retention of students in STEM areas. Future priorities like job security had been identified as major factors for retaining in STEM subjects.

Women in Engineering: Insight into Why Some Engineering Departments Have More Success in Recruiting and Graduating Women,"Bossart, Jean; Bharti, Neelam","Universities across the United States (U.S.) are perplexed as to why fewer women than men study engineering and why even fewer complete the curriculum and earn an undergraduate degree in engineering. The percentage of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded annually to women in the U.S. since 2000 has remained relatively constant at around 20%. However, some engineering disciplines have had much greater success in graduating women, with some programs awarding 50% or more of their bachelor's degrees to women. The purpose of this research was to gain a better understanding of why women preferred certain engineering disciplines over others. Up to 17 years of undergraduate engineering department data from the University of Florida (UF) and national averages from the National Science Foundation (NSF) were reviewed to evaluate graduation rates for women in engineering. The total number of graduates at the undergraduate level were compared to the number of undergraduates who identified themselves as women. Linear regression of the data was used to identify trends. In the last 17 years, there has been little change in the overall percentage of women engineering undergraduates, but there is a great disparity between the engineering disciplines. Women earn larger proportions of undergraduate degrees in engineering disciplines where they perceive a societal benefit. How can engineering departments improve their enrollment and retention of women? One way is by providing early-on specific real life examples of how engineers solve society's most challenging problems.",2017,,American Journal of Engineering Education,8,2,127-140,2011271728; EJ1162927,,,#272,Bossart 2017,"",""
Rising to the Challenge: Acute Stress Appraisals and Selection Centre Performance in Applicants to Postgraduate Specialty Training in Anaesthesia,"Roberts, Martin J.; Gale, Thomas C.

Individuals who evaluate potentially stressful situations as challenging rather than threatening may perform better under pressure and be more resilient to stress and burnout. Training programme recruitment processes provide an important opportunity to examine applicants' reactions to acute stress. In the context of multi-station selection centres for recruitment to anaesthesia training programmes, we investigated the factors influencing candidates' pre-station challenge/threat evaluations and the extent to which their evaluations predicted subsequent station performance. Candidates evaluated the perceived stress of upcoming stations using a measure of challenge/threat evaluation--the cognitive appraisal ratio (CAR)--and consented to release their demographic details and station scores. Using regression analyses we determined which candidate and station factors predicted variation in the CAR and whether, after accounting for these factors, the CAR predicted candidate performance in the station. The CAR was affected by the nature of the station and candidate gender, but not age, ethnicity, country of training or clinical experience. Candidates perceived stations involving work related tasks as more threatening. After controlling for candidates' demographic and professional profiles, the CAR significantly predicted station performance: ""challenge"" evaluations were associated with better performance, though the effect was weak.

"Choosing the Geoscience Major: Important Factors, Race/Ethnicity, and Gender","Stokes, Philip J.; Levine, Roger; Flessa, Karl W.","Geoscience faces dual recruiting challenges: a pending workforce shortage and a lack of diversity. Already suffering from low visibility, geoscience does not resemble the makeup of the general population in terms of either race/ethnicity or gender and is among the least diverse of all science, technology, engineering, and math fields in the U.S. Many studies discuss recruiting and diversity issues in science and math, but only a small number consider--and address quantitatively--barriers in geoscience. We interviewed 31 current and former geoscience majors (18 women, 13 men; 8 Hispanics, 21 whites) at a large university in the southwestern U.S. to collect 926 ''critical incidents,'' or experiences that affected choice of major. These critical incidents were classified, sorted, and analyzed by race/ethnicity and gender. We found that positive experiences in introductory courses, supportive family members, personal characteristics that meshed with geoscience, and outstanding field experiences were the most commonly reported factors influencing the choice of a geoscience major. Though our sample was not large, we interpret these factors as crucial tools for improving recruitment and retention. Hispanic students reported more familial factors, and more negative familial factors, than white students. Hispanic students also reported fewer informal outdoor experiences and fewer incidents involving personal factors. Men reported more critical incidents related to career and economic factors than women. Women reported more negative experiences than men in required nongeoscience courses. These findings suggest that sociocultural factors behind underrepresentation in other fields may similarly impede diversity in geoscience.

Gendered Education in a Gendered World: Looking beyond Cosmetic Solutions to the Gender Gap in Science,"Sinnes, Astrid T.; Løken, Marianne","Young people in countries considered to be at the forefront of gender equity still tend to choose very traditional science subjects and careers.

This article uses feminist critiques of science and science education to explore the underlying gendered assumptions of a research project aiming to contribute to improving recruitment, retention and gender equity patterns in STEM educations and careers. Much research has been carried out to understand this gender gap phenomenon as well as to suggest measures to reduce its occurrence. A significant portion of this research has focused on detecting the typical ""female"" and ""male"" interest in science and has consequently suggested that adjustments be made to science education to cater for these interests. This article argues that adjusting science subjects to match perceived typical girls' and boys' interests risks being ineffective, as it contributes to the imposition of stereotyped gender identity formation thereby also imposing the gender differences that these adjustments were intended to overcome. This article also argues that different ways of addressing gender issues in science education themselves reflects different notions of gender and science. Thus in order to reduce gender inequities in science these implicit notions of gender and science have to be made explicit. The article begins with an overview of the current situation regarding gender equity in some so- called gender equal countries.

Based on a literature review and conducted focus groups, draft measures for the study constructs were developed. Data were collected from 217 students and an exploratory factor analysis identified 6 factors that potentially influenced satisfaction. After scale development, multiple regression analysis was used to test the research questions. It was found that the two genders displayed a difference in the factors influencing their satisfaction. For female students, only reputation (beta?=0.499, p?<?0.01) was significant, while for male students, both reputation (beta?=?0.763, p?<?0.01) and perceived faculty academic competence (beta?=?0.301, p?<?0.01) were significant.

Sources of Inspiration: The Role of Significant Persons in Young People's Choice of Science in Higher Education,"Sjaastad, Jorgen","The objectives of this article were to investigate to which extent and in what ways persons influence students' choice of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in tertiary education, and to assess the suitability of an analytical framework for describing this influence. In total, 5,007 Norwegian STEM students completed a questionnaire including multiple-choice as well as open-ended questions about sources of inspiration for their educational choice. Using the conceptualisation of ""significant persons"" suggested by Woelfel and Haller, the respondents' descriptions of parents and teachers are presented in order to elaborate on the different ways these significant persons influence a STEM-related educational choice. Parents engaged in STEM themselves are ""models"", making the choice of STEM familiar, and they help youngsters define themselves through conversation and support, thus being ""definers"". Teachers are models by displaying how STEM might bring fulfilment in someone's life and by giving pupils a positive experience with the subjects. They help young people discover their STEM abilities, thus being definers. Celebrities are reported to have minor influence on STEM-related educational choices. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that ""interpersonal relationships"" are key factors in order to inspire and motivate a choice of STEM education. Implications for recruitment issues and for research on interpersonal influence are discussed. It is suggested that initiatives to increase recruitment to STEM might be aimed at parents and other persons in interpersonal relationships with youth as a target group.

Gender Stereotypes among Women Engineering and Technology Students in the UK: Lessons from Career Choice Narratives,"Powell, Abigail; Dainty, Andrew; Bagilhole, Barbara","In the UK, women remain under-represented in engineering and technology (E&T). Research has, therefore, investigated barriers and solutions to women's recruitment, retention and progression. Recruitment into the sector may be supported by exploring the career decisions of women and men who have chosen to study E&T. Triangulating quantitative and qualitative data from E&T students at a UK university, this paper examines the gendered nature of career choice narratives. It finds that women often maintain contradictory views; upholding gendered stereotypes about women's suitability for the so-called masculine work, yet also subscribing to ideals that the sector is accessible to all who wish to work in it. This is explained using an individualist framework in which women construct an autonomous sense of self, yet are also shaped by a gendered self. Women's discourse around career choice, therefore, reveals the problematic nature of gender norms for achieving gender equity in E&T.

We explore these variables and their impact on career orientation through a set of overlapping regression models. In general, we find that strong social support and high self-efficacy are associated with strong orientation toward careers in CIS careers. However the influences of perceived self-efficacy and social support appear to differ for men and women: while low self-efficacy is tied to less social support for males, we see no similar tendency for females. In fact many females who report themselves as low in self-efficacy consider themselves to have high social support among their peers.

Circle of Strength: Tribal Colleges Aim to Recruit and Retain Native Male Students,"Pember, Mary Annette","As tribal colleges aim to retain Native male students, they're finding that talking, drumming, construction, and spirituality may keep men in school. Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Community College (LCOOCC, Hayward, Wisconsin) is just one of the tribal colleges across the country looking for innovative ways to attract and retain more men. Postsecondary enrollment and graduation rates for men continue to lag behind numbers for women. This is hardly a new story for either tribal or mainstream colleges and universities. Since there is a dearth of data regarding this gender disproportion, however, the causes remain elusive. In an attempt to address that issue, a number of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) have added disciplines such as agriculture and farming, automotive technology, building trades, computer science and technology, corrections, engineering, and environmental science. LCOOCC Student Services Director Paul Grahovac started the Men's Talking Circle to help male students deal with problems and challenges that affect their enrollment and attendance at college. The circle is modeled on a traditional Native talking circle in which a talking stick is passed from one participant to another who then speaks free from interruption. Men's Talking Circle mimics the basic ideas of the talking circle in which people can sit on a peer level and interact. Although there is no empirical evidence that the Men's Talking Circle works, it has played a major role in recruitment and retention of American Indian males at LCOOCC.",2011,,Tribal College Journal of American Indian Higher Education,22,4,,964192470; EJ949688,,,#297,Pember 2011,"",""

This long-term overview examines how recruitment to these three subjects has changed in the context of numerous policies and initiatives that seek to retain more young people in the sciences. The results show that recruitment to the pure sciences has stagnated, general trends have hardly varied and the track record of government policy in influencing change is not strong. There is no evidence for increasing achievement gaps between the sexes at A level and even national policy requiring that all young people study science up to the age of 16 appears to have had little impact on recruitment at this level.

Gender Matters: An Examination of Differential Effects of the College Experience on Degree Attainment in STEM,"Gayles, Joy Gaston; Ampaw, Frim D.","Although more women than men are enrolled in college within the United States, women remain underrepresented in critical areas of study such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This is particularly concerning given that STEM fields of study are vital to the economic growth and workforce development within the United States. In order for the United States to maintain its status as a competitor in addressing global issues, it will be imperative to increase and diversify the U.S. STEM workforce. The loss of women in STEM fields at critical junctures of the education pipeline has received national attention over the past few decades, and federal support has been earmarked for attracting and retaining women and other underrepresented populations in STEM fields. Although it is true that women have made gains in bachelor's degree attainment in STEM over the past thirty years, a closer look at the data shows that they have not reached parity with their male counterparts. A critical issue of concern is the high number of women who enter college with an interest in STEM and the low number of women who actually complete a STEM bachelor's degree six years later. This article reports the major findings from a study that examined the extent to which the effects of college experiences on degree completion in STEM at four-year colleges and universities differed for men and women. The results from the study yielded a number of interesting findings about which college experiences influence timely degree completion in STEM fields. The authors discuss the results of the first model, which examines degree completion for all students, and then the second model, where gender interacts with the variables of interest.

It also uses a long-term view to look at the best available evidence to monitor participation and attainment over an extended period of time. The findings suggest that almost three decades of initiatives to increase participation in STEM subjects have had little noticeable impact on the recruitment data and gendered patterns of participation persist in several subject areas. This is despite more women entering HE and little gender difference in the entry qualifications for STEM subjects. While more women are studying science, as broadly conceived, than ever before, recruitment to key areas, namely physics and engineering remains stagnant.

Still so Few Male Teachers: Now What?,"Johnson, Shaun Patrick","A shortage of male teachers at all levels of public education is not a new phenomenon. Gender disparities in teaching have been around for more than a century in the United States. While roughly 39 percent of all elementary and secondary public school teachers were men as early as 1869, only 29 percent of teachers were men by the turn of the twentieth century--a figure dropping to 24 percent 50 years later. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2009) reports that a mere 2.2 percent of preschool and kindergarten teachers and 5 percent of child care workers are men. Gender disparity in teaching is not unique to the United States. A comprehensive body of research literature examining the experiences of male teachers exists both at home and abroad. Much of this published work describes the attitudes of men as preservice teachers, as experienced professionals, and on leaving the profession. Many studies conclude that further research is needed to better understand why more men don't consider a career in education. Few studies, however, devote attention to possible solutions to the male teacher shortage, such as describing or evaluating recruitment initiatives.

Exploring the Temperament and Character Traits of Rural and Urban Doctors,"Eley, Diann; Young, Louise; Przybeck, Thomas R.","Context: Australia shares many dilemmas with North America regarding shortages of doctors in rural and remote locations. This preliminary study contributes to the establishment of a psychobiological profile for rural doctors by comparing temperament and character traits with an urban cohort. Purpose: The aim was to compare the individual levels and combinations of temperament (mildly heritable and stable) and character (developmental and modifiable) traits of rural and urban general practitioners (GPs). Methods: Rural (n = 120) and urban (n = 94) GPs completed a demographic questionnaire and the TCI-R 140 to identify levels of the 7 basic dimensions of temperament and character. These are Novelty Seeking (NS), Harm Avoidance (HA), Reward Dependence (RD), Persistence (PS), Self-Directedness (SD), Cooperativeness (CO), and Self-Transcendence (ST). Findings: Preliminary results show rural GPs were higher in the temperament traits of NS and lower in HA compared with the urban sample. All female GPs were higher in RD and CO compared with all males, and all older GPs (over 55 years) were lower in RD compared with all younger GPs. Conclusions: This preliminary work may be the precursor to a new approach for the recruitment and retention of rural doctors through a greater awareness of personality traits conducive to the rural workforce.

Meeting the Challenge of Gender Equity in Community College Athletics,"Castaneda, Cindy; Katsinas, Stephen G.; Hardy, David E.","Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 state, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance"". This provision paved the way for student-initiated lawsuits claiming discrimination in the area of intercollegiate athletics and resulted in a great expansion in opportunities for women and girls to participate in athletics. Thirty-six years after the passage of Title IX, it seems reasonable to assess the status of gender equity in intercollegiate athletics. A substantial body of scholarly books and articles exists on the subject at four-year colleges and universities. Interestingly enough, little work explores two-year colleges.

Which University? A Study of the Influence of Cost and Information Factors on Scottish Undergraduate Choice,"Briggs, Senga; Wilson, Alex","At a time when higher education institutions (HEIs) around the globe face declining student numbers and decreasing funding grants, it becomes imperative for those involved in the recruitment process to understand the factors utilized by students in the search process. This paper explores the influence of two such factors: Information Supplied by Universities and Cost of the Package on undergraduate choice at six universities in Scotland. It reflects a two-year survey (2003/04 and 2004/05) of 1,400 students in two undergraduate disciplines, namely accountancy and engineering. The findings add empirical weight to the importance of focused and ""informed"" student recruitment practice and importantly they also provide an impetus for the re-examination of information and marketing strategies.

The Academic Climate of Women Faculty in Faith-Based Institutions of Higher Learning,"Halstead, Jackie L.; Loy, Courtney","The unequal status of women professors, compared to their male counterparts, is not staggering news. While women constitute approximately sixty percent of the undergraduate population and earn more than half the doctorates in the United States, women professors continue to number fewer than men. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) claims that although sex discrimination is becoming less blatant, these and other statistics clearly reveal patterns of discrimination. A segment of the institutions of higher learning, faith-based institutions, demonstrate these same patterns of inequity. Although the women who are employed by these schools initially believe they will find themselves in a less biased environment, it is soon apparent that the dynamics are similar to other colleges and universities and at times magnified. A qualitative study was undertaken to examine these dynamics. Focus groups were facilitated at five faith-based institutions of higher learning and findings were compared to the climates of other academic institutions. These findings will be articulated along with recommendations for the creation of a climate conducive to the recruitment and retention of women faculty.",2007,,Forum on Public Policy Online,2007,1,1-31,1826534554; EJ1098477,,,#318,Halstead 2007,"",""

Masculinities in Organizational Cultures in Engineering Education in Europe: Results of the European Union Project WomEng,"Sagebiel, F.; Dahmen, J.","The paper describes elements of engineering organizational cultures and structures in higher engineering education from the European project WomEng. Hypotheses, based on state of the art, refer to: women friendly presentation, attractiveness of interdisciplinary teaching methods, single sex education, perceptions of minority status, feelings of isolation, existing discrimination and coping strategies of female students. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies, asking questions of and observing students and faculty are completed by website analyses. The results show that special recruitment and a welcome for women do not exist everywhere and, furthermore, are denied by faculty of some countries. General welcome events are appreciated. Among interdisciplinary subjects, languages and soft skills are preferred, along with people-oriented teaching. Attitudes towards single sex education are controversial. The general male engineering image is combined with negative attitudes and discrimination practices in only some countries. More latent discrimination, like prejudice, jokes and stories, lead to self-confidence coping strategies by female students. The results are reflected on the basis of feminist and men's studies. The conclusions refer to inherent dilemmas in research on masculinities in engineering education.

Addressing the Shortage of School Psychologists: A Summative Overview,"Davis, Andrew S.; McIntosh, David E.; Phelps, LeAdelle; Kehle, Thomas J.","The role of the school psychologist has evolved from the traditional position of psychometrician to a scientist-practitioner who assumes a more progressive, proactive leadership position in initiating reform in the schools. This shift is guided by a changing paradigm from child deviance, or child pathology, to a collaborative, problem-solving orientation that is characterized by a focus on interventions and altering student outcomes (Ysseldyke & Elliot, 1999). This shifting philosophy mandates that school psychologists, to serve as effective advocates for children, should focus on outcomes, employ more preventative techniques, utilize empirically supported interventions, and take an active role in initiating changes in their schools and the communities (Davis, 2001). A more preventative approach increases the role, and the necessity, of school psychologists working directly with children in special education and children not in special education. Yet, the field continues to undersupply the number of school psychologists needed to effectively meet these critical goals. The paucity of school psychologists available to serve children in the schools is reflected in the shortfalls in higher education and with practitioners (e.g., Reschly, 2000; Tingstrom, 2000). Additionally, school psychologists face disparities in gender, ethnic, and racial representation relative to the U.S. population, with the majority of school psychologists being Caucasian females (e.g., Curtis, Grier, Abshier, Sutton, & Hunley, 2002; Thomas, 1998). This may lead to a lack of identification from the student's perspective or a deficiency of culturally sensitive methods and techniques from the school psychologist, especially in poor areas where minorities tend to be overrepresented (Steinberg, 2002). The shortage of school psychologists, especially minority school psychologists, is reaching a crisis state. To overcome this shortage, a call to action is proposed to all practicing school psychologists, trainers in higher education, professional organizations, and legislators. Taking progressive, proactive steps may involve reconceptualizing the practice of school psychology, increasing visibility of the profession, becoming more involved in politics and legislation, employing unique approaches to recruitment, utilizing technology in training programs, and actively recruiting minority candidates. The purpose of this article is to review past solutions to this problem, analyze what is currently being done, and propose new resolutions to address these concerns.

The Influence of Prototypical #MeToo Features on the Perception of Workplace Sexual Harassment Across Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation (LGBTQ +),"","IntroductionHow we perceive social-sexual behavior, and to what extent we consider such behavior to be sexual harassment, is dependent on several situational factors. Prototypical #MeToo features (male actor and female target, higher status, repeated, private behavior, sexualized physical contact) have previously been shown to increase the degree to which social-sexual behavior is perceived as sexual harassment. The effect of those features needs to be investigated for types of harassment that involve same-gender sexual harassment and harassment of LGBTQ + people. To gain a wider perspective on the perception of social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment, this preregistered study aims to examine same-gender interactions and lesbian and gay actors and targets, in addition to replicating earlier findings about #MeToo features in opposite-sex constellations.MethodsWe applied five hypothetical scenarios to a Norwegian online sample of 888 participants between 18 and 60 (58.3% cis women, 40.8% cis men, 0.9% transgender/genderfluid/non-binary). The sampling process took place during the spring term 2020 and aimed at recruiting LGBTQ + people (63.3% of the sample self-identifying as heterosexual, 20% gay/lesbian, 10.7% bisexual, 3.2% pansexual, and 1.9% “other”).Results#MeToo features in each scenario clearly increased the degree to which social-sexual behavior was perceived as sexual harassment across gender identity and sexual orientation. The effect of private vs. public behavior was contingent on the type of behavior. Men rated behavior less as sexual harassment than women and people of other gender identities.ConclusionsThe current study shows that there was considerable consensus as to what sexual harassment entails in the five scenarios across gender identity and sexual orientation.Policy ImplicationsOrganizations should include prototypical #MeToo features in interventions, to illustrate how a situation might be more or less undesired and therefore experienced as harassment under different circumstances.",2024,,Sexuality Research & Social Policy,21,4,1500-1514,3143078319,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-023-00850-y,,#335,,"",""
Emphasizing the Communal Demands of a Leader Role Makes Job Interviews Less Stressful for Women But Not More Successful,"Nater, Christa; Eagly, Alice H.; Heilman, Madeline E.; Messerli-Bürgy, Nadine; Sczesny, Sabine","The cultural construal of leadership as masculine impedes women’s attainment of leader roles. This research examined whether adding feminine demands to a leader role relieved the greater stress experienced by women than men in a job interview for a leadership position and considered the processes that mediated women’s less favourable interview outcomes. In a hiring simulation, management students (N = 209; 112 women, 97 men) interviewed for a leader role framed by either stereotypically feminine or masculine role requirements. As shown by the stress biomarker salivary cortisol, the feminine role framing alleviated women’s, but not men’s, physiological stress response during the interview. However, under both masculine and feminine role framing, women, compared with men, reported lesser fit, expected poorer interview performance, appraised greater threat relative to challenge, and evaluated their performance less favourably, as did external raters. An additional vignette study (N = 305; 189 women, 111 men, 5 diverse) found that the feminine role framing increased the leader role’s communal demands but still conveyed strong agentic demands not different from those of the masculine role.

Mandatory Quotas and Women’s Representation on South African Mining Boards: Levelling the Field or Perpetuating Inequalities?,"Moraka, Nthabiseng V","Globally, women have been a minority in corporate boardrooms for decades, with little improvement witnessed over time. Even with the introduction of quota legislation, boardrooms worldwide are slow in recruiting and retaining women directors. This study examined the impact of quota policies, specifically the South African Mining Charter, on board representation in South African mining companies. In-depth interviews with 36 board members (20 women and 16 men) across six Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed (JSE) mining companies formed the basis of the analysis of the implementation of the quota system. By means of thematic data analysis, the findings of this research revealed contrasting outcomes of quota system implementation in the mining sector boards of quota policy implementation. Firstly, findings show that quotas propelled compliance-based appointments, which were not skills- or merit-based. Secondly findings showed that the quota system facilitated the recruitment of more black women to boards by signalling a tick box exercise, which facilitated a negative board reception. Several black women experienced a sense of mockery, leading to a need to prove their competence, which often resulted in an added burden, particularly for women who regarded themselves, as competent as their male counterparts. Regardless, the women interviewed affirmed that quota targets needed to be imposed with more focus on merit-based recruitment to enhance the radical transformation of board compositions. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and scholars seeking a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics surrounding the implementation of quota legislation. It concludes that quotas are required to enforce radical changes in the gender composition of boards. The implementation of quotas through a competitive recruitment process aimed at selecting skilled women is recommended.

Rights of Women Laborers in the Indian Legal System: A Critical Analysis,"Kaur, Kirandeep","Women laborers form an important part of the labor workforce in India; however, not all are recognized, not many are protected, and very few are treated equally to men. The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976 clearly states that persons doing ""same work or work of a similar nature"" are not to be discriminated against on the ground of gender. The Factories Act of 1948 has special provisions for women workers pertaining to washrooms, changing rooms, creches, and work hours. The Maternity Benefit Act of 1961 entitles a woman, inter alia, to twenty-six weeks of paid maternity relief. The protection given to women under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 is also of vital importance for women workers in India. The laws prima-facie seem to be protecting the rights of women workers, but a deeper analysis of their effectiveness is required to take the concerns of women into account. It is to be noted that one of the areas of concern is the amount of unpaid labor put in by women in Indian households and home industries, which remains unrecognized. This paper offers a feminist analysis of labor legislation affecting women laborers in India from the perspective of women and their rights. Also analyzed are the various schemes of the Government of India pertaining to welfare and empowerment of women, various international instruments, and international labor standards. The research methodology used is a combination of analytical and critical research. Pay parity and equality in opportunity, recruitment, promotion, transfer, and facilities at the workplace are a few pertinent steps towards the amelioration of the conditions of women laborers in the country. The ultimate goal is to address the issues which need to be resolved for women workers to exercise their rights at par with the other labor categories. These issues are significant and have far-reaching implications.

LGBTQ+ in workplace: a systematic review and reconsideration,"Maji, Sucharita; Yadav, Nidhi; Gupta, Pranjal","PurposeThe inclusion of LGBTQ + persons (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and having other sexual orientations and gender identities) is a crucial step in improving gender diversity in the workplace; however, till date, it remains a significant challenge for human resource management professionals. The current study critically examines this issue of an inclusive workplace for LGBTQ + people through a systematic review of the existing research that has empirically studied their experiences at the workplace. It also examines the resistance and challenges organizations face in LGBTQ + diversity training and provides future research avenues.Design/methodology/approachFor systematically reviewing the literature, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model has been used. A total of 101 empirical studies have been reviewed.FindingsThe result shows that LGBTQ + people encounter multiple negative workplace experiences, including proximal (hiring discrimination and housing discrimination) and distal workplace discrimination (unsafe work climate, microaggressions and harassment). These aversive experiences lead to work stress while also mandating that people manage their sexual identity and style of dressing.

An exploratory study of benefits and challenges of neurodivergent employees: roles of knowing neurodivergents and neurodiversity practices,"Ali, Muhammad; Grabarski, Mirit K; Baker, Marzena","PurposeNeurodiversity refers to a spectrum of neurological differences. Little is known about the benefits and challenges of employing neurodivergent individuals in the retail industry and how knowing neurodivergent individuals/neurodiversity practices are linked to benefits/challenges. This study provides these insights using the lenses of the value-in-diversity perspective, stigma theory and intergroup contact theory.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from an online survey of retail supervisors and co-workers from Australia, resulting in 502 responses from various retail organizations.FindingsThe findings indicate that supervisors have higher awareness of neurodiversity and perceived benefits of neurodivergent employees. Knowing neurodivergents was positively associated with perceived benefits and disclosure challenges and negatively associated with equity and inclusion challenges. Neurodiversity practices were positively associated with benefits of neurodivergent employees, negatively associated with disclosure challenges and equity and inclusion challenges in small stores, and positively associated with equity and inclusion challenges in large stores.Originality/valueCurrent empirical research on workplace neurodiversity is scarce.

Are Claims of Fairness Toward Women in the Academy “Manufactured”? The Risk of Basing Arguments on Incomplete Data,"Ceci, Stephen J.; Williams, Wendy M.","Claims of widespread sexism in academic science frequently appear both in the mainstream media and in prestigious science journals. Often these claims are based on an unsystematic sampling of evidence or on anecdotes, and in many cases these claims are not supported by comprehensive analyses. Here we illustrate the importance of considering the full corpus of scientific data by focusing on a recent set of claims by two philosophers of science who argue that researchers who fail to find evidence of sexism in some domains of academia–such as tenure-track hiring, grant funding, journal reviewing, letters of recommendation, and salary–are as epistemically and socially problematic as are those who deny claims of anthropogenic climate change. We argue that such claims are misguided, and the result of ignoring important evidence.

Discrimination in the hiring process – state of the art and implications for policymakers,"Calluso, Cinzia; Devetag, Maria Giovanna","PurposeDespite the increasing heterogeneity of the organizational workforce – as a consequence of major worldwide socioeconomic trends – a considerable number of studies shows how traditionally underrepresented groups still face significant barriers in entering the labor market.

Then, we offer a point of reflection for policymaking, analyzing whether such issue should be addressed at the level of the individual (i-frame) or rather at a more systemic level (s-frame).FindingsThe paper provides substantial evidence that discrimination in hiring still exists, despite the never greater pressure for firms’ social sustainability. Further, existing interventions appear to have an overall limited impact in reducing bias.

Engaging older Australians in sexual health research: SHAPE2 survey recruitment and sample,"Bourchier, Louise; Temple-Smith, Meredith; Hocking, Jane; Bittleston, Helen; Malta, Sue","BackgroundSexual health research rarely includes older age groups and the sexual health needs of older Australians are not well understood. Older adults are online in increasing numbers; however, internet surveys involving samples of older adults and sensitive topics remain uncommon. In 2021, we developed an online survey to explore the sexual health needs of Australians aged 60+ years. We describe here survey recruitment and sample obtained, comparing it with national population data (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and the sample of the similar ‘Sex, Age and Me’ study from 2015.MethodsWe recruited 1470 people with a staggered three-phase strategy: (1) emails to organisations and community groups; (2) paid Facebook advertising; and (3) passive recruitment. Half (50.6%) found out about the study via an organisation or group and just over a third (35.7%) from Facebook.ResultsThe sample was equally balanced between men (49.9%) and women (49.7%) (0.4% other gender identities). Participants were aged 60–92 years (median 69 years) with all Australian States/Territories represented. Facebook recruits were younger, more likely to be working rather than retired, and more likely to live outside a major city, than those recruited by other means.ConclusionsUsing the recruitment methods described, we successfully obtained a diverse and fairly representative sample of older Australians within the constraints of a convenience sample and on a modest budget. This research sheds light on ways to engage an under-served demographic in sexual health research. Our experience shows that many older adults are amenable to recruitment for online sexual health surveys using the approaches outlined.",2024,,Sexual Health (Online),21,1,,3122182219,https://doi.org/10.1071/SH23116,,#352,Bourchier 2024,"",""

Although emerging research exists on some subgroups, limited attention has been given to the needs of Arab GBMSM in these contexts. Considering they are part of a large diaspora, understanding their access to services is crucial. This paper focuses on Arab GBMSM as a case study within a scoping review, highlighting their hidden status within the broader landscape of HIV and sexual health research for GBMSM in the West.MethodsA multi-method search strategy was employed, including searching four electronic databases using several terms within each of the following search topics: Arab, GBMSM, HIV and other sexual health services, and developed Western countries.ResultsOf the 384 articles found, only one addressed the research question and met the inclusion criteria, revealing a stark scarcity of research on access to HIV and sexual health services for this population.ConclusionsThis review highlights a paucity of research on access to HIV and sexual health services for underrepresented GBMSM populations in developed Western countries. The literature indicates that, for Arab men, this may be due to a difficulty in participant recruitment and poor data collection efforts. By focusing on one hidden population, we aim to advocate for inclusive policies and interventions that promote equitable sexual health access for all. Addressing this research gap aligns with broader local and global HIV strategies to reduce disparities among underrepresented GBMSM populations.",2024,,Sexual Health (Online),21,1,,3122182213,https://doi.org/10.1071/SH23131,,#353,Saliba 2024,"",""
Self-reported intimate partner violence among men who have sex with men at an urban Australian sexual health clinic,"Boots, Georgina; Crozier, Brendan; Popovic, Gordana; McNulty, Anna","BackgroundIn Australia, 17% of women and 6% of men have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). Although most IPV research has focused on heterosexual partnerships, studies suggest that men who have sex with men (MSM) may experience IPV at similar or higher rates than those documented among women. IPV may also take different forms among MSM and have different health and social impacts. This study aims to assess the utility of a screening tool for identifying and responding to IPV among MSM attending a sexual health clinic in Sydney, Australia.MethodsBetween 1 June 2020 and 30 June 2022, MSM clients were screened using standardised questions to identify IPV experienced within the preceding 12 months. Answers to the screening questions were correlated with data collected routinely at the initial clinic visit, including age, employment, country of birth, drug and alcohol use, sexual partner numbers, and any history of sex work, pre-exposure prophylaxis use and HIV status, as well as any bacterial STI diagnosed at the initial visit.ResultsThere were 2410 eligible clients and of these, 2167 (89.9%) were screened during the study period. A total of 64 men (3.0%) (95% CI 2.3–3.8%) reported experiencing physical violence or intimidation in the past 12 months. Controlling for age, men who were born in Australia were 2.03 (95% CI: 1.04–3.01) times more likely to report IPV, and men who had Medicare were 2.43 (95% CI: 0.95–3.90) times more likely to report IPV than those who did not. Those who had ever injected drugs were 5.8 (95% CI: 1.87–9.73) times more likely to report IPV, and men with sexualised drug use were 4.11 (95% CI: 2.03–6.19) times more likely. Those that were employed or studying were 72% (95%CI: 0.13–0.42) less likely to report IPV.ConclusionsThe prevalence of reported IPV in our study was lower than that reported by others, which may be due to differences in recruitment methods and questions asked. Associations between IPV in MSM and injecting drug use and sexualised drug use highlight that clinicians should be aware of the impact and potential for IPV particularly in those with risk factors.",2024,,Sexual Health (Online),21,1,,3122182138,https://doi.org/10.1071/SH23160,,#354,Boots 2024,"",""
Sexual risk and testing for sexually transmissible infections in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous young South Australians: results of an online survey,"Harfield, Stephen; Elliott, Salenna; Barzi, Federica; Minto, Kiara; Dean, Judith A; Ward, James","BackgroundDisproportionate rates of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are often attributed to risk-taking behaviours, but research rarely conducts direct comparison with their non-Indigenous peers to address this negative discourse.Methods‘Let’s Talk About It 2019’ was a cross-sectional online survey of South Australians (16–29 years). It prioritised recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander respondents to compare behaviours with non-Indigenous peers using multivariable Poisson regression models.ResultsAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (n = 231) and non-Indigenous (n = 2062) respondents reported similar condom use (40% vs 43%, P = 0.477) and sexual debut median ages (16 years vs 17 years). Higher proportions of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander respondents reported a recent health check (48% vs 38%, P = 0.002), STIs (60% vs 49%, P < 0.001) and HIV (37% vs 28%, P = 0.006) testing, STI diagnosis (29% vs 21%, P = 0.042), and intoxication during last sex (30% vs 18%, P < 0.001).ConclusionsBehaviours associated with STI transmission were mostly similar among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous respondents.

We conducted a thematic analysis with data from digitally recorded interviews transcribed verbatim. Conformity to heteronormative sexuality formed an important part of childhood socialization, and deviance became a growing source of parental-child conflict during puberty. Secrecy, which was commonplace among participants, was a critical strategy to protect against deteriorating family relationships, and financial hardship. Mediation by family elders helped restore communications post-disclosure, and positively influenced the parental role in protecting the child against discriminatory practices. Tension between the legal and social normative framework demonstrates that liberalizing contentious rights in law cannot be transformative without social change strategies.

Gender or Gendered Demand of Care?

As a step towards addressing human resource shortages in the health and social care sectors, the UK has recently reached a bilateral agreement with Nepal to recruit Nepali nurses.

We used Fiske’s Stereotype Content Model (SCM; Fiske et al., 2002) framework to examine majority group women’s perceptions of ID-labeled women and the relation of pity to their support for ID-labeled women’s sexual rights and related policies.MethodsIn 2020, we surveyed 307 majoritized (i.e., White, heterosexual, and cisgender) adult women in the U.S. through an online recruitment platform. We elicited their perspectives regarding four marginalized groups of women, including those who are labeled with ID, low-income, adolescents, and lesbians.ResultsWomen labeled with ID were viewed as more warm than competent and were regarded with pity more than other groups of marginalized women. Evaluations of competence were associated with support for sexual rights and related policies of ID-labeled women, but not women in the other marginalized groups.ConclusionsThese results underscore disability scholars’ and activists’ concerns that pity is particularly directed toward ID-labeled women and that it may undermine others’ support of their sexual rights and opportunities.Policy ImplicationsIn response, we advocate for a broader conception of competence and greater social integration.

The relationship between women and racial minority employees/managers and financial performance,"Smith, Katherine Taken; De Leon, John A","PurposeDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) have become prioritized goals of business, such as hiring more women and racial minorities. This study adds to the body of research regarding the value of diversity in organizations by examining the relationship between diversity at the workforce level and the financial performance of the organization. The empirical results of prior research have provided mixed results, finding mainly positive, but also negative, and nonsignificant relationships (Sharma et al., 2020; Vlas et al., 2022). The purpose of this study is to examine the current employment status of women and racial minorities in top US companies, then analyze if a correlation exists between a company’s profit margin and its percentage of women and racial minority employees and managers.Design/methodology/approachThis study examined the top 200 companies in the Fortune 500 companies; these are the largest companies by revenue in the USA. Companies were ranked according to each variable (% of women employees, % of racial minority employees, % of women managers and % of racial minority managers) and then divided into equal quartiles. The mean profit margin for the top quartile was compared with the mean profit margin for the bottom quartile. T-tests were used to determine whether significant differences in profit margin exist between companies. This methodology of comparing top and bottom quartiles was developed in prior studies.FindingsFortune 200 companies have an average of 40% women and also 40% racial minorities in their workforce. Both women and racial minorities account for a smaller percentage of managers. Women account for 34% of managers, while racial minorities account for 29%. There is a significant positive relationship between profit margin and two of the variables. Companies with 45% or more women managers have a significantly higher profit margin than companies with the lowest percentages of women managers. Companies with 48% or more racial minority employees have a significantly higher profit margin than companies with the lowest percentages of racial minority employees. These findings are in-line with the existing body of research that has found mixed impacts of diversity on firm performance (cf.

Interview data were coded and analyzed using the Gioia methodology.FindingsResults revealed that deferential, reserved and hardworking are the top three perceptions attributed to female professionals of Asian descent working in North America. These perceptions are not commendatory or derogatory by themself. They can be associated with either positive or negative leadership qualities, depending on the specific behaviors exhibited and how those behaviors are interpreted. The authors’ analysis maps the relationship between these perceptions and behaviors associated with the executive presence literature. The respondents’ three key recommendations for neutralizing the negative connotations of these perceptions are discussed.Practical implicationsThe results of this study reinforce the need to develop influence, communication and relational skills (e.g. executive presence) in women of Asian ethnicity. The study respondents’ recommendations provide a foundational curriculum guide for doing so. The results also support the need to train hiring managers to become ever more aware of their cultural biases, focusing on how these biases impact their hiring, performance evaluation and promotion practices.Originality/valueThere is a dearth of research regarding the career experiences of Asian women working in North American corporations.

Seeing past different signals in the job interview: information improves ratings of candidates on the autism spectrum,"Comer, Debra R; Lenaghan, Janet A; Motro, Daphna","PurposeThe authors used signaling theory to explain negative perceptions of individuals on the autism spectrum (IotAS) in the job interview and explored whether parasocial contact could improve perceptions.Design/methodology/approachParticipants were randomly assigned across six experimental conditions. Some received information that IotAS' social and communication differences prevent them from attaining jobs they could perform (information), some received this information and watched a video showing IotAS working competently (parasocial contact) and others were exposed to neither information nor video (control). Participants then watched a mock interview of a job candidate presenting as an IotAS or neurotypical and gave their first impressions of him, perceptions of his job suitability and selection decision.FindingsParticipants had less favorable first impressions of the IotAS-presenting candidate and perceived him as having lower job suitability and were therefore less likely to select him. Parasocial contact had no effect. However, participants who had received information that IotAS' differences keep them from being hired for jobs they could do perceived the IotAS-presenting candidate as more suitable for the job and had greater intentions to interact with and select him.Originality/valueThe authors enhance understanding of autism in the workplace by explaining how IotAS' signaling behavior during a job interview impedes their selection.

Gender Equality in South African Public and Private Domains: A Theoretical Discriminatory Perspective,Malesela Jim Masenya,"The purpose of this paper is to elucidate that there is a measured resolution to discriminate against women in the public and private domains. The paper is virtuously theoretical and relies upon literature to present its arguments, soliciting information from published journals, reports, and previous studies. For many years, tremendous efforts have been made to link the disease of gender discrimination to women’s empowerment practices in a manner that focuses mostly on understanding and breaking the various chains and channels of the disease’s transmission pathways. Gender discrimination is common in many countries and manifests itself in various forms, e.g., discriminatory hiring practices, wage discrepancies, limited promotion opportunities, unfair dismissals, early compulsory retirement ages, and sexual harassment. South Africa is characterised by inequalities that create different worlds in one country. In a democratic societal administration, the issues of marginalisation, estrangement, erroneous notions of women’s rights, empowerment, and social position are expected to have been issues of the past. However, all efforts at making relevant reforms, including constitutional, judicial, and administrative policies and programmes, as measures to eliminate and redress discrimination against women have not essentially influenced the feminine notion of gender equality. The paper argues that although there are many measures, frameworks, and policies that aim to combat gender discrimination, women are deliberately discriminated against at work as well as in communities. Therefore, the paper concludes that discrimination against women remains a serious developmental paradigm. The cultural patriarchies remain entrenched within societies and, therefore, continue to manifest under the auspices of democracy. Women continue to absorb pressure to combine both unremunerated and remunerated work, while men are doing less.",2023,,"African Journal of Gender, Society & Development",12,3,195-195–210,2872097317,https://doi.org/10.31920/2634-3622/2023/v12n3a9,,#368,MaleselaJimMasenya 2023,"",""
Examining the impact of reasonable accommodation appraisals on New Zealand managers' attitudes toward hiring people with disability,"Oliver Nelson D'Souza; Kuntz, Joana RC","PurposeManagers are responsible for implementing reasonable accommodation (RA) for people with disabilities (PwD). Yet, little is known about the extent to which managerial views of RA shape attitudes toward PwD. The study draws on conservation of resources (COR) and job demands and resources (JD-R) theories to examine the relationship between managerial views of RA availability and implementation ease on attitudes towards hiring PwD.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 162 full-time managers at a large New Zealand (NZ) healthcare organisation completed an online survey.

"Do Legal and Institutional Reforms in Punjab, Pakistan Protect Women's Inherited Land Rights?","Rubab, Iram; Malik, Beenish; Aziz, Zujajah Bakht","Economic marginalization is a key feature of gender inequality globally. In Pakistan, which ranks 153 out of 156 countries on the Global Gender Gap Index Report 2020, economic marginalization has significantly hampered efforts towards inclusivity. In comparison to dismal levels of female literacy and formal occupation (traditional measures of development), inheritance is an interesting category-a right enshrined both in Islam (the official state religion) and the country's constitution. Given Pakistan's agrarian and otherwise rent-seeking economic orientation, land inheritance plays a pivotal role in financial wellbeing regardless of gender. However, a pervasive denial of women's inheritance rights has been the norm. Considering the data and impelled by its international obligations, the Government criminalized denial of inheritance in 2011, followed by a series of legal and institutional reforms in the province of Punjab. These reforms include provisions for help desks dedicated to women at key offices, digitization of land records, and clamping down on anti-women practices that aid denial of inheritance. It is alarming to note that not much has changed in terms of women's land inheritance since 2011. To understand what is impeding the amendment's efficacy, the study frames these developments from a socialist feminist perspective and captures the opinions of experts engaged with the cause in various capacities. We selected Punjab as a case study and recruited twelve legal, revenue, Islamic, and women's right experts through purposive sampling. In-depth interviews were conducted, and the findings were thematically organized. Experts largely agreed that cultural change is a long-term process and that there has been a patriarchal monopoly of Islamic interpretation. On a more practical end, issues plaguing developing economies were highlighted in addition to institutionalized patriarchy, female mobility, patriarchal control of citizenship and land documents, and bureaucratic hurdles. We recommend the recruitment of more female staff in all relevant offices, adoption of better data management practices catering to institutional harmony, and that district inheritance committees be operationalized, among other measures.",2023,,Journal of International Women's Studies,25,4,1-17,2829873815,,,#371,Rubab 2023,"",""
Gender Is Not a Proxy: Race and Intersectionality in Legislative Recruitment,"Tolley, Erin","Election to office is shaped by a series of decisions made by prospective candidates, parties, and voters. These choices determine who emerges and is ultimately selected to run, and each decision point either expands or limits the possibilities for more diverse representation. Studies of women candidates have established an important theoretical and empirical basis for understanding legislative recruitment. This study asks how these patterns differ when race and intersectionality are integrated into the analyses. Focusing on more than 800 political aspirants in Canada, I show that although white and racialized women aspire to political office at roughly the same rates, their experiences diverge at the point of party selection. White men remain the preferred candidates, and parties’ efforts to diversify politics have mostly benefited white women.

We tested the hypothesis that middle school students strongly associate technology with men and caregiving with women in a Swedish context (i.e., a country that scores high in gender equality indices), and that these gender stereotypes for tech relate to girls’ lower interest in tech-focused education. We measured technology/caregiving gender stereotypes with implicit (the Implicit Association Test) and explicit (self-report) measures in a sample of middle school students (n = 873). The results supported the main hypotheses, and corroborate Eccles’s expectancy value theory, indicating that the endorsement of implicit gender stereotypes may serve as barriers to pursuing masculine-typed career paths for women. Further, a sample of middle school teachers (n = 86) showed stronger implicit gender stereotypes than the students. Unexpectedly, middle school girls with a foreign background showed no implicit gender stereotypes, which we discuss in relation to the gender-equality paradox.

An Analysis of Vulva Appearance in Video Pornography,"Maki, Samantha M.; Vernaleken, Lauren; Nemes, F. Dylan; Bozic, Kylie; Cioe, Jan D.","Media uses implicit imagery to tell women which genital standards are deemed acceptable by society. Explicit depictions of genitals are usually reserved for pornographic materials, which women often describe as depicting uniform vulva appearance. It is possible that viewing invariable images of vulvas could have a negative impact on women’s self-perceptions. To better understand the vulva representations women are exposed to, the current study collected images (N = 743) of vulvas from video pornography via two websites: Pornhub.com and Bellesa.co. We categorized images based on the level of pubic hair grooming and labia minora protrusion. Bellesa did not differ from Pornhub for the labia minora feature. We found that the majority of images from both websites had barely any protrusion of the labia minora past the labia majora. Pornhub showed vulvas with no hair most often, whereas Bellesa had slightly more variation in level of grooming. It is evident that both websites are depicting mostly uniform vulvas—small, groomed, and tidy. Undeviating depictions could influence women’s genital ideals, pushing them to seek out extreme surgery and beauty measures in order to adhere to the standards presented. Much like clothing advertisements, which now present a range of body shapes and sizes, presenting a diverse set of images of vulvas could be beneficial to viewers. Based on the impact these images have on women’s psychological wellbeing, makers of pornography should consider diversifying their search and hiring criteria when selecting actresses, while also providing image disclaimers for their viewers.",2023,,Sexuality & Culture,27,1,310-325,2762557823,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-022-10014-6,,#374,Maki 2023,"",""

Middle ageism: when social climate and perceived employability relate to attitudes and intent to hire middle-aged employees,"Galy Binyamin; Brender-Ilan, Yael","Purpose>As the global workforce ages, organizations face unprecedented challenges, especially managing effective communication between generations. The phenomenon of middle ageism (i.e. discriminating against middle-aged employees based on their age) has become more prevalent. The authors examined how contextual settings and communication affect attitudes toward middle-aged employees and hiring intentions.Design/methodology/approach>Data were collected from 537 employees from various organizations, via questionnaires. The moderated mediation model was analyzed using Hayes' PROCESS models.Findings>Results showed that attitudes toward middle-aged employees mediated the relationship between social climate of shared codes and language and hiring intentions. Social climate was positively related to attitudes toward their adaptability, but negatively to attitudes toward their ability. Also, decision-makers' own perceived employability moderated the relationship between attitudes toward employees' adaptability and hiring intentions, and the indirect relationship between social climate and hiring intentions.Practical implications>Since age diversity is expected to become one of the most dominant diversity classifications in the very near future, coping with middle ageism constitutes a growing challenge for managers and HR staff. The findings indicate that in order to enhance sustainable employment and prevent discrimination, organizations need not only maintain a supportive climate for older employees, as an affirmative action, but also ensure better communication in terms of sharing codes and language that enhance positive attitudes toward middle-aged colleagues.Originality/value>In an era where diversity and inclusion dominate human resource management decision making, this study contributes to the literature on the underexplored domain of age diversity.",2023,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",42,1,70-86,2771271084,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-09-2021-0234,,#379,GalyBinyamin 2023,"",""
Résumé screening heuristic outcomes: an examination of hiring manager evaluation bias,"Moore, Ozias A; Livingston, Beth; Susskind, Alex M","Purpose>Hiring managers commonly rely on system-justifying motives and attitudes during résumé screening. Given the prevalent use of modern résumé formats (e.g. LinkedIn) that include not only an applicant's credentials but also headshot photographs, visible sources of information such as an applicant's race are also revealed while a hiring manager simultaneously evaluates a candidate's suitability. As a result, such screening is likely to activate evaluation bias. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of a hiring manager's perceptions of race-system justification, that is, support for the status quo in relations between Black and White job candidates in reinforcing or mitigating hiring bias related to in-group and out-group membership during résumé screening.Design/methodology/approach>Drawing from system justification theory (SJT) in a pre-selection context, in an experimental study involving 174 human resource managers, the authors tested two boundary conditions of the expected relationship between hiring manager and job candidate race on candidate ratings: (1) a hiring manager's affirmative action (AA) attitudes and system-justifying attitudes and (2) a job candidate's manipulated suitability for a position. This approach enabled us to juxtapose the racial composition of hiring manager–job candidate dyads under conditions in which the job candidate's race and competency for a posted position were manipulated to examine the conditions under which White and Black hiring managers are likely to make biased evaluations. The authors largely replicated these findings in two follow-up studies with 261 students and 361 online raters.Findings>The authors found that information on a candidate's objective suitability for a job resulted in opposite-race positive bias among Black evaluators and same-race positive bias among White evaluators in study 1 alone. Conversely, positive attitudes toward AA policies resulted in in-group favoritism and strengthened a positive same-race bias for Black evaluators (study 1 and 2). We replicated this finding with a third sample to directly test system-justifying attitudes (study 3). The way in which White raters rated White candidates reflected the same attitudes against systems (AA attitudes) that Black raters rating Black candidates exhibited in the authors’ first two studies. Positive system-justifying attitudes or positive attitudes toward AA did not, however, translate into the elevation of same-race candidate ratings of suitability above those of opposite-race candidates.Research limitations/implications>Although the size of the sample is on par with the percentage of Blacks nationwide in private-sector managerial-level positions ideally, the authors would have preferred to oversample Black HR managers. Given the scarcity of focus on Black HR managers, future researchers, using diverse samples of evaluators should also consider not only managers' and candidates' race but also their social dominance orientation. Moreover, it is important that future researchers use more racially diverse samples from other industries to more fully identify the ways in which the dynamics of system-justifying processes can emerge to influence evaluation bias during résumé screening.Practical implications>Advances in technology pose new challenges to HR hiring practices. This study attempts to fill a void regarding the unintended effects of bias during digital résumé screening. These trends have important HR implications. Initial screening of a job applicant's credentials while concurrently viewing the individual's photograph is likely to activate subconscious evaluation bias, produces inaccurate applicant ratings. This study's findings should caution hiring managers about the potential for bias to arise when viewing job candidates' digital résumés and encourage them to carefully examine various boundary conditions on racial similarity bias effects on applicant pre-screening and subsequent hiring decisions.Social implications>The study’s results suggest that bias might be attenuated as organizational leaders engage in efforts to understand their system-justifying motives and examine perceptions of the workplace social hierarchy (i.e. responses to status hierarchies) linked to perceptions of the status quo. For example, understanding how system justifying motives influence evaluation bias will inform how best to design training and other interventions that link discussions of workforce diversity to the relationships among groups within the organization's social hierarchy. This line of research should be further explored to better understand the complex forces at work when hiring managers adopt system-justifying motives during hiring evaluations.Originality/value>The authors address the limitations of prior research by examining interactions between boundary conditions in a real-world context using real human resources hiring managers and more contemporary personnel-screening practices to test changes in the direction and strength of the relationship between hiring manager–job candidate race and hiring manager evaluations. Thus, the authors’ findings have implications for hiring bias and understanding of system-justification processes, particularly regarding how, when and why hiring managers support the status quo (i.e. perpetuate inequity) even if they are disadvantaged as a result.",2023,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",42,1,104-134,2771271064,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-04-2021-0115,,#380,Moore 2023,"",""

Using a systemic review technique, we search different databases in English language for relevant literature published between 2000 and 2019 that address various dynamics of human trafficking, irregular migration and modern-day slavery in Nigeria. Findings revealed that the victims of human trafficking/irregular migration/modern-day slavery are either coerced or are recruited through their own voluntary cooperation with their assailants. Specifically, the recruitment process often begins with seduction, cajolement and oath taken, through which they voluntarily cooperate with the assailants, who are usually people they know closely such as friend or family member, who often play major roles in the trafficking trajectories of victims, usually for their own profit. Considering the clandestine nature of operation and attendant negative consequences surrounding these phenomena, more research is needed to better understand the complexity surrounding the menace of human trafficking/irregular migration/modern-day slavery in the country.

A decade and a half after Jones first proposed them, in-person informational events have become an industry trend. Given the transparent objective of recruiting paying clients, these events must inevitably combine persuasion with education. Through participant observation at three such information sessions held by different clinics in a large city in the eastern US, I present an analysis of their content and form. The article examines the extent to which these events adhered to guidelines on securing informed consent and how the form of these events produce a complex blend of affect and sociality that likely affect how information is received. I argue that egg freezing informational events employ subtle techniques of persuasion that cultivate anxiety and link egg freezing to desirable traits or lifestyles through social enactment.",2022,,Hypatia,37,4,642-658,2774763388,https://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.47,,#382,Bhatia 2022,"",""
"One Out Gay Cop: Gay Moderates, Proposition 64, and Policing in Early AIDS-Crisis Los Angeles, 1969-1992","Ramos, Nic John; Burnett, Alex","Ramos and Burnett examine the role of gay moderates in shaping the hiring of openly gay police officers in Los Angeles during the early AIDS crisis. The gay moderates, predominantly white middle-class individuals, sought to protect their own privacy and property through policing. They mobilized voters and formed alliances with politicians to push for the inclusion of openly gay officers in the police force. They trace the history of gay moderate activism, from their defense of gay bars in the 1970s to their focus on individual privacy rights and homeownership in the 1980s. The emergence of the AIDS crisis complicated their efforts, as Christian conservatives used the epidemic to attack gay privacy rights. Despite the challenges, gay moderates continued to prioritize gay community policing and worked to redefine the meaning of gay citizenship. They argue that the activism of gay moderates in Los Angeles had significant implications for national politics and the rise of the carceral state.",2022,,Journal of the History of Sexuality,31,3,361-393,2882575412,https://doi.org/10.7560/JHS31304,,#383,Ramos 2022,"",""
Decision-making in the recruitment of women on corporate boards: does gender matter?,"Bhardwaj, Sneh","Purpose>The author provides an insider view of women directors' selections on corporate boards from the empirical setting of India and find if the recruitment practices in this space discriminate against women.Design/methodology/approach>The study collected data from a diverse cohort of 27 directors through semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed by applying an interpretative inductive approach and using the software NVivo's 12-plus version.Findings>The author’s findings show that board recruiters present different selection criteria and processes to women candidates depending upon heterogeneity among candidates' professional standing. Recruiters view women directors as a diverse cohort and value resourceful and experienced women when making recruitment decisions; these women directors are also found influencing directors' selection processes.Originality/value>The results question the underlying assumptions of prejudice against women as posited by the feminist and social identity theorists without accounting for the heterogeneity among women and situations. By proposing the female-gender stereotyping deactivation theory in top leadership matters, such as board selections, the author argues that stereotyping becomes irrelevant in the strategic decisions of board selections.

"Women in Academia: Representation, Tenure, and Publication Patterns in the STEM and Social Sciences Fields","Krebsbach, Jennifer M","Women in the workplace experience inequity in their professional career options and in their upward mobility. One place this occurs frequently is in higher education. Whether it be their representation at various levels of professorship (wherein male full professors far outweigh the number of female full professors), the interactions with others on campus (especially regarding student expectations of professors), or the expectations that are placed upon them for success (over recruitment for teaching and service to the university; under recruitment for research opportunities and grants), women in academia are finding barriers that are preventing them from succeeding at a similar rate or frequency to that of their male counterparts. This review examines women's experiences in academia, specifically those items related to promotion. The author describes the individual aspects of tenure (student evaluations, service to the university, and research) and the barriers that women have reported experiencing within each category, the previous data regarding the inequity between male and female professors, and how publication impacts promotion. Inequity exists in each of the three primary areas of the tenure process, but one area that has shown the greatest impact is within academic publication. The author reviewed the literature across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and social sciences regarding 1) the role of sex in publication (from both the authors of submissions and the editors-in-chief of the journal), and 2) discrepancies in acceptance rates. The article ends with recommendations for future study surrounding tenure for women in higher education.

The analysis shows that TW highly value friendship, and maintaining a good relationship with the participants will improve recruitment and retention. Further, TW also suggested employing well-connected and respected TW influencers and community leaders to facilitate recruitment and retention, especially through online platforms. Other facilitators include having the opportunities to learn more about HIV and access to TW-friendly healthcare service, while the barriers are competing priorities and lack of a TW-centered approach.Conclusion/Policy ImplicationThis study elucidates the existing barriers and facilitators to research participation for TW.

"""You Cannot Be What You Cannot See""1: The Lived Experiences of Women Teaching Digital Literacy in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Germany","Hayman, Lorraine J","This timely paper provides empirical evidence on the lived experiences of ten women from eight nationalities in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Germany, who voluntarily taught girls and women digital skills in 2020. I situated this multi-case feminist study within the digital skills gender divide phenomenon. I collected qualitative data through surveys and interviews with the teachers, remote observations of their digital skills lessons, and analysis of programme documents, including curricula. In this paper, I discuss two research questions: (1) ""What motivated the women to teach digital literacy?"" and (2) ""Why do the teachers think the digital skills gender divide exists?"" The hybrid approach to data coding and thematic analysis indicated that the teachers were motivated to teach digital literacy to support their students' selfdevelopment and use digital skills in their daily lives. The teachers at the school in Germany were also motivated by advancing their social capital and societal integration, as six of the eight women teaching in Germany were migrants. The teachers from Bosnia & Herzegovina were motivated by overcoming the systemic gender inequality that the digital skills gender divide encapsulates. The teachers also identified various personal, community, and societal causes of the digital skills gender divide. On the micro-level, they noted that girls engage in risk avoidance behaviour from a young age, limiting their digital skills development. On the mesolevel, women lack exposure to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) within their families and communities. On the macro-level, the teachers in Bosnia & Herzegovina highlighted that girls living in urban areas could access ICT more often than those living in rural areas. This paper offers resolutions to the digital skills gender divide, concluded from the teachers' evidence, such as educational opportunities, gender diversity hiring in technical roles in the ICT sector, and policy development to underpin solutions and incentivise compliance.

Non-immigrant Precarity and the Corporate University: Rethinking Limitations of Critical Research and Reimagining Decolonial Possibilities,"Chatterjee, Sudeshna","This paper explores the various ways in which organizational structures of the corporate university are imbricated in racial hierarchies underlying global immigration, with particular reference to non-immigrant precarity in US academia. Moving beyond critiques focused on curriculum and pedagogy, I argue that as an epitomizing product of capitalism, the corporate university must be dismantled to decenter global knowledge creation itself. We must view the generation of critical social science research in context of interactions between the colonizing structure of global immigration laws and Global North's academic institutional hierarchies. The paper begins by theoretically framing corporate university, its co-option of diversity and equality as the cornerstone of contemporary neoliberalism and its entanglements with contemporary immigration regimes such that it emerges as a site for non-immigrant precarity. I then discuss how seemingly critical fields of inquiry such as academic feminism are institutionally arranged within corporate universities to sustain racialized precarity for non-immigrants in academia, through hiring, research, and pedagogical practices. I conclude by drawing on two grassroots education models in India as means for (re)imagining decolonial possibilities with subversive philosophies of education and spatial alternatives, which are crucial for feminist research to be meaningful.",2022,,Feminist Formations,34,1,212-241,2812733924,https://doi.org/10.1353/ff.2022.0009,,#390,Chatterjee 2022,"",""

A Study of Japanese Women's Attitudes Toward Hiring Domestic Laborers,"Kamata, Suzanne; Kita, Yoko","In the Global Gender Gap 2020 Report, which tracks gender parity in education, health, politics, and economic participation, Japanese women were ranked 121st out of 153 (World Economic Forum, 2019), lagging far behind other Asian countries such as the Philippines, which came in at 16, Singapore, which ranked 54th, and Thailand in 75th place. Although Japanese women are highly educated and in good health, this represents an all-time low for Japan and might be seen as a setback. although the number of working women has increased, most are not engaged in career-track jobs; the number of women in executive or managerial positions, as well as high level government jobs, lags far behind that of other industrialized nations (Shim, 2018). Shambaugh et. al. suggests the less than stellar labor market outcome for Japanese women may be due to the possibility ""that work other than full-time and regular employment is a better fit for the circumstances and preferences of some working women"" and that they choose jobs which enable them to ""balance employment with non-work obligations"" (2017). In other words, they may be choosing part-time or lower-level jobs because Japanese working women who are married with children still bear the brunt of childcare, housekeeping, and caring for elderly relatives. Furthermore, they are left with little time for career development activities which might lead to advancement. This, however, is not a uniquely Japanese dilemma. Women in other countries often hire workers to help with domestic tasks. Hitherto, little research has been done to determine the effect of hiring help on gender disparity in the Japanese workplace. In this paper, we will examine the results of a survey on attitudes toward hiring help to better understand why working women in Japan tend to not outsource domestic work.",2022,,"Journal of International Women's Studies, suppl.

Do Elites Discriminate against Female Political Aspirants? Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Dhima, Kostanca","Do elites exhibit gender bias when responding to political aspirants? Drawing on theories of gender bias, group attachment, and partisan identity, I conduct the first audit experiment outside the United States to examine the presence of gender bias in the earliest phases of the political recruitment process. Based on responses from 1,774 Canadian legislators, I find evidence of an overall gender bias in favor of female political aspirants. Specifically, legislators are more responsive to female political aspirants and more likely to provide them with helpful advice when they ask how to get involved in politics. This pro-women bias, which exists at all levels of government, is stronger among female legislators and those associated with left-leaning parties.

"Immigrant health care workers from developing countries in the US: antecedents, consequences and institutional responses","Franklin Oikelome; Broward, Joshua; Dai Hongwu","Purpose>The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual model on foreign-born health care workers from developing countries working in the US. The model covers their motivations for migration, the consequences in terms of the inequality and exclusion they may experience and the role of institutional responses at micro-, macro- and meso-level of intervention.Design/methodology/approach>The paper is based on: (1) in-depth review of key literature studies on the foundation theories of international migration including sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and human resource management, (2) analysis of theoretical approaches to medical migration across disciplines, (3) analysis of the international and national documentary sources of micro-, macro- and meso-level policies on migration and (4) analysis of evidence on best practices, solutions and aspirational changes across different levels of institutions.Findings>(1) Migration of international medical graduates (IMGs) from developing countries to the US can be explained from a micro-, macro- and meso-level of analysis. (2) IMGs who identify as racial/ethnic minorities may experience unfair discrimination differently than their US-born counterparts. (3) Although political/legislative remedies have had some successes, proactive initiatives will be needed alongside enforcement strategies to achieve equity and inclusion. (4) While diversity management initiatives abound in organizations, those designed for the benefit of IMGs from developing countries are rare. (5) Professional identity groups and some nonprofits may challenge structural inequities, but these have not yet achieved economies of scale.Research limitations/implications>Although it is well-documented in the US health care literature how ethnic/racial minorities are unfairly disadvantaged in work and career, the studies are rarely disaggregated according to sub-groups (e.g. non-White IMGs and US-born MGs). The implication is that Black IMG immigrants have been overlooked by the predominant narratives of native-born, Black experiences. In placing the realities of native-born Blacks on the entire Black population in America, data have ignored and undermined the diverse histories, identities and experiences of this heterogeneous group.Practical implications>An awareness of the challenges IMGs from developing countries face have implications for managerial decisions regarding recruitment and selection. Besides their medical qualifications, IMGs from developing countries offer employers additional qualities that are critical to success in health care delivery. Considering organizations traditionally favor White immigrants from Northern and Southern Europe, IMGs from developed countries migrate to the US under relatively easier circumstances. It is important to balance the scale in the decision-making process by including an evaluation of migration antecedents in comprehensive selection criteria.Social implications>The unfair discrimination faced by IMGs who identify as racial/ethnic minority are multilayered and will affect them in ways that are different compared to their US-born counterparts. In effect, researchers need to make this distinction in research on racial discrimination. Since IMGs are not all uniformly impacted by unfair discrimination, organization-wide audits should be in tune with issues that are of concerns to IMGs who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Likewise, diversity management strategies should be more inclusive and should not ignore the intersectionality of race/ethnicity, nationality, country of qualification and gender.Originality/value>Immigrant health care workers from developing countries are integral to the health care industry in the United States. They make up a significant proportion of all workers in the health care industry in the US. Although the literature is replete with studies on immigrant health care workers as a whole, research has rarely focused on immigrant health care workers from developing countries.

Affirmative Action Policies in Academic Job Advertisements: Do They Facilitate or Hinder Gender Discrimination in Hiring Processes for Professorships?,"Henningsen Levke; Horvath, Lisa K; Jonas, Klaus","Evidence of female-favoring hiring preferences for assistant professorships suggests that universities can implement affirmative action programs successfully. However, research on the role of applicant gender and the actual use of affirmative action policies in hiring processes for high-level professorships remain scarce. A web-based experiment with 481 economic university members assessed whether evaluators perceived a female applicant as less qualified than a male applicant for an associate professorship position when the job advertisement highlighted the university’s commitment to affirmative action (gender-based preferential selection) but not when it solely highlighted its commitment to excellence (non-gender-based selection). Contrary to previous experimental findings that affirmative action would adversely affect female applicants, evaluators perceived the female applicant as more hirable and ranked her first for the job significantly more often than the male candidate. Furthermore, male evaluators had a stronger preference for the female candidate in the gender-based condition than in the non-gender-based condition and a stronger preference for the male candidate in the non-gender-based condition than in the gender-based condition. Overall, the results provide evidence that gender-based preferential selection policies can evoke their intended effect to bring highly qualified women to high-level professorships, especially when being evaluated by non-beneficiaries of these policies, such as men.",2022,,Sex Roles,86,1-2,34-48,2616788093,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-021-01251-4,,#398,HenningsenLevke 2022,"",""

I argue that settler colonial racial grammars underpin the discussion of race and education by Hampton teachers, administrators, and staff. Settler colonial racial grammars are structures and patterns of meaning that relate racial and ontological discourses to domination of land through settler conquest, hinging on the process of gendering and ungendering. These grammars work through defining Black and Indigenous women in relation to space, time, and ontological condition. Using Christina Sharpe's theorization of anagrammatical Blackness in concert with my own concept of Indigenous hyperpunctuation, I lay out the ways that Black and Indigenous women were at the center of Hampton's industrial education project.

This paper explores the limits of labelling sexual identities, and how definitions of “sex” and “work” have become increasingly unstable in the digital age.MethodsThis study used mixed methods, with the primary mode of data collection being qualitative interviews with young gay, bisexual, and queer men conducted between May 2015 and April 2016. The interviews incorporated a nine-point sexuality scale and photo-elicitation procedures to prompt further discussions. Through the participant recruitment process, the study also generated an informal survey of 1473 Grindr users aged 18 to 28, finding that 14.6% had been paid for sex, most of whom (8.2%) had done so “incidentally.”ResultsThe 50 interview participants discussed being paid for sex 358 times. This paper focuses on their narratives of labelling, identity politics, sexual normativity, and social stigma. All participants distanced themselves from labels such as “prostitute,” “rent boy,” or “sex worker” given that their behaviours were not seen as “regular” or “professional” enough, alongside seeking to avoid association with stigmatising stereotypes of sex work. These results are compared with the participants’ experiences of coming out as gay, bisexual, and queer.DiscussionThese narratives are interpreted using queer theory to understand those whose behaviours and identities do not conform to normative (legal, medical, social) discourses of sex work.

Assessing Perceptions of Broad Consent Concerning Biological Specimen Collection in a Cohort of Young Sexual Minority Men,"Cook, Stephanie H; Wood, Erica P; Jaiswal, Jessica; Castro, Robert; Calderon, Liz; Qi, Ying; Llaneza Amanda","The use of broad consent to store human biospecimens to be used in future research studies has increased over the years. However, it is currently unknown how young sexual minority men (YSMM) perceive broad consent in these specific types of studies. Therefore, in this study we aimed to determine the extent to which YSMM are comfortable with providing broad consent concerning their identifiable biological specimens to a variety of entities, including external researchers and pharmaceutical companies and to examine the relationship between mistrust based on racial/ethnic identity or sexual orientation and attitudes toward broad consent. YSMM (N = 239) ages 24–27 years were recruited from a prospective cohort study in New York City in 2018 to complete a survey assessing attitudes about the use of broad consent concerning biospecimens for secondary research. We found that YSMM were most willing to provide broad consent to the researcher from the study they were enrolled in (85.3%), other researchers within the same university (82.4%), and researchers at other universities (74.5%). Participants were least willing to provide broad consent to government organizations (64.4%) and pharmaceutical companies (53.8%). Further, we found that medical mistrust based on racial/ethnic identity or sexual orientation was associated with attitudes toward the use of broad consent.

Evaluations of LGBT job applicants: consequences of applying “out”,"Bryant-Lees, Kinsey B; Kite, Mary E","PurposeThis study aimed to experimentally investigate whether disclosing one's sexual orientation while applying for a job would impact hiring decisions.Design/methodology/approachThe experiment employed a 2 (Applicant Gender: Male/Female) × 2 (Applicant Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual or Gay/Lesbian) × 2 (Job Type: Masculine/Feminine) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 349) were randomly assigned to one of eight applicant conditions. They were first presented with a job description, followed by a cover letter displaying the applicants' qualifications, gender and sexual orientation. Participants evaluated the applicant's competence, social skills and hireability, and provided self-reports of their attitudes toward gays/lesbians and traditional gender roles.FindingsThe results demonstrated a distinct pattern of discrimination toward gay/lesbian applicants who were rated significantly lower in competence, social skills and hireability than were heterosexual applicants. Additionally, using multigroup structural equation modeling, we found that sexual orientation differentially impacted the relationship between attitudes and hireability ratings; negative attitudes toward homosexuality, beliefs about sexual orientation as a choice and belief in traditional gender roles were significant predictors of hireability ratings for gay/lesbian applicants, but were unrelated to evaluations of heterosexual applicants.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study highlights the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination against Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans (LGBT) workers including lower evaluations of competence, social skills and structural differences in the impact of attitudes. These direct links must be explicitly addressed for continued progress related to equality, diversity and inclusion in Human Resource Management (HRM). Continued multidisciplinary research that considers gender identity and sexual orientation signal salience, consequences of specific career stereotypes, regional differences and the effects of societal shifts in attitudes overtime will continue to improve our understanding and drive us toward a more equitable future.Practical implicationsBy identifying the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination, this study highlights the need for diversity trainings that go beyond the blanket approaches to diversity management and explicitly address conscious and unconscious biases that may influence the hiring process. Additionally, it is critical for organizations to provide top-down support from leadership, and implement mechanisms that allow LGBT voices to be heard and feel comfortable in their work environment to reduce the psychological strain.Social implicationsPrior to the recent landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on June 15, 2020, which extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act workplace protections to gay, lesbianand transgender employees, in many places across the United States Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) identifying workers could still be legally discriminated against. The pattern of discrimination identified in the current study provides clear evidence that these protections are necessary, and long overdue.Originality/valueThis study identifies two clear patterns of hiring discrimination: (1) lower hireability ratings and (2) structural differences in the evaluative process for gay/lesbian applicants. These findings provide experimental evidence, currently lacking in the literature, that support survey-based and qualitative findings of LGBT's experiences, and demonstrate how negative attitudes, irrelevant to the qualifications of an applicant, seep into hiring decisions.",2021,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",40,7,874-891,2583778165,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-01-2019-0048,,#402,Bryant-Lees 2021,"",""
Are women from Venus? A mixed-method study determining important predictors of job pursuit intention across gender groups,"Dutta, Debolina; Mishra, Sushanta Kumar","PurposeDespite studies claiming gender inclusion is beneficial for organizations, the under-representation of females in the workforce is a reality. As recruitment practices impact employees' entry into organizations, examining the salient predictors of job pursuit intention might foster gender inclusivity.Design/methodology/approachBased on a mixed-method study conducted in two phases (Phase 1: a sample of 2,084 professionals; Phase 2: interviews of 20 senior human resource (HR) professionals and interviews with 26 women professionals), we examine the key predictors of job pursuit intention of women. We employed a qualitative study as Phase 2 employed a qualitative study to understand why some of the proposed hypotheses were not supported.FindingsWe found that work–life balance, perceived job security and perceived ethical behavior of organizations were more important for female than the male applicants in influencing their job pursuit intention. Also, the type of work and person–organization (P–O) fit were found to be equally important for both the gender groups. The implications of the study to theory and practice were discussed.Research limitations/implicationsOur study extends the existing literature by identifying salient factors (such as work–life balance, perceived job security and ethical citizenship) that are found to be more important for female applicants compared to their male counterparts while pursuing a job. Also, females were found to worry more about losing or not finding a job than males. Our results further indicate that type of work and P–O fit have a significant effect on job pursuit intention for both male and female applicants. The study addresses the need for research on targeted recruitment to increase gender inclusion.Practical implicationsThe contribution of this paper lies in identifying critical factors relevant to the female applicants in India who potentially constitute a large talent pool waiting to be leveraged. It adds to the body of knowledge on enabling inclusivity and affirmative action for increasing gender diversity through recruitment. By highlighting the factors that should be given prominence in job promotions to attract more female candidates and emphasizing the gender-focused HR policies and practices and through internal and external communication, it helps practitioners attract and retain female applicants in an emerging economy like India.Originality/valueOur study contributes in three ways. First, it attempts to plug the gap by investigating gendered preferences in job pursuit intentions between male and female applicants, especially in different cultural environments and in emerging markets such as India. Second, existing studies on job pursuit intentions were based mostly on inputs from student respondents. Our study has collected data from professionals working in organizations who have worked and experienced gender-related HR practices in organizations.

Women's gender capital gained currency, adding an additional dimension to the high levels of human and social capital seen as desirable for board appointments. The politics of women's presence is bringing about changes to the discourse and practice about who should/can be a director. The authors identify highly strategic ways in which women's gender capital has been used to agitate for more women to be appointed to boards.Research limitations/implicationsWhile sample sizes are small, data within the themes cohered meaningfully across the time periods, making visible how women's presence in the board room has been reframed. Future research could consider what this may mean for board dynamics and how enduring are these changes.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the forms that human and social capital take in board appointments, which can be instructive for potential directors, and how these intersect with gender capital.

Ambiguous practices and conflicting interests: why immigrants end up in uncertain employment,"Lindheim, Tone","PurposeThe aim of this study is to investigate why many immigrants end up in uncertain employment.Design/methodology/approachThe paper describes a qualitative case study of three nursing homes in Oslo (Norway), which investigates immigrant employment and recruitment-related practices. Practice theory is used as the theoretical and methodological framework. The study takes an ethnographic approach and combines participant observation, semi-structured shadowing, qualitative interviews and document review.FindingsThe recruitment practice, as it is accomplished, is different from the practice that is prescribed in the formal recruitment policy. The configuration of the recruitment-related practices locks in the recruitment practice and reproduces the social order. The net effect of the recruitment-related practices is that immigrant employees remain in uncertain employment.Research limitations/implicationsA practice-theoretical approach, analyzing organizational practices as they are accomplished in space and time and not as isolated activities defined by their purpose, provides a richer understanding of the complexity and connectedness of organizational practices. Combining practice theory and institutional perspectives, the paper demonstrates how normative and regulative mediators order and align related practices.

The global bases of inequality regimes: the case of international nurse recruitment,"Näre, Lena; Tricia Cleland Silva","PurposeThe purpose of this article is to critically examine Joan Acker's notion of inequality regimes by applying it to the case of global nurse care chains (GNCCs). The article examines the organisational practices of GNCCs and how inequality barriers are practiced and legitimised.Design/methodology/approachThe article is based on qualitative interviews with different institutional representatives involved in Filipino nurse recruitment to Finland (N = 25), recruited Filipino nurses (N = 20) and Filipino nurses working in Finland (N = 9).FindingsThe article demonstrates different organisational practices through which inequality regimes are created and sustained. These include the racialised construction of the Philippines as situated in the global periphery and functioning as a resource of labour for the global core and the Filipino nurse as innately more caring. The inequalities are legitimised through deskilling in which the nurses' command of Finnish language is a key form of justification. Filipino nurses' precarious legal status renders them compliant workers from an organisational perspective and vulnerable workers who fear to claim their rights as workers.Practical implicationsBy discussing barriers to inequality, the article illustrates how inequalities in diverse workplaces and the undervaluing of nurse work could be addressed.Originality/valueThe article uniquely applies Acker's inequality regimes to the study of GNCCs.

THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TALENT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES,"Morukhu, Doreen; Mapanga, Arthur; Mokgojwa, Deborah","The main aim of this study was to investigate the role of talent leadership in developing high potential academics in a selected high institution in South Africa. While the literature extensively discusses talent management issues, less evident is a comprehensive discussion of the role leaders plays in talent management. So obvious is this issue in the HEIs where leaders lack the requisite guidance on how to avert the persistent talent shortages, inefficient talent recruitment, mediocre career management, absence of employee engagement, uncertain reward systems, dented employment relationships, and the failure to retain top talent once employed. To understand the role that leadership plays in talent management, we adopted a non-experimental research design to purposively select a total of 10 academic managers for face-to-face interviews. Apart from the interviews, we also carried out document analysis to understand the expectations upon leadership in talent management in HEIs. We then applied Atlas.TI software to extract codes and them es reflecting the role of leadership in talent management. The study indicates the role of leadership in higher education institutions to include the review ofthe talent pool, offering strategic leadership of talent, effectively deploy the available talent, reward the talent, motivate talent, retain the talent, coach the talent, manage performance, innovate and communicate talent management matters. This paper thus brings new theoretical andpractical insights on the role of leadership in talent management. However, to allow the transference of these findings, it is necessary to undertake further studies using different contexts to develop the theory on the role that leadership plays in talent management.",2021,,Gender & Behaviour,19,2,17827-17835,2649772822,,,#408,Morukhu 2021,"",""
"Socio-legal Implication of Legalising Same-Sex Marriage in Cultural Yoruba Society, Osun State, Nigeria","Adewumi, Samson Adeoluwa","Previous studies on same-sex marriage have only examined the discourse of same-sex marriage through the lens of religion, morality and philosophy. Others include political and human rights perspective in Nigeria with paucity of research on socio-legal dimension. Therefore, this paper assesses the socio-legal consequences that are plausible with the legalisation of same-sex marriage in cultural Yoruba society. The exploratory design was employed with a total of 20 respondents (community and traditional leaders and law enforcement officers) recruited through purposive and convenience recruitment strategies. The semistructure interview approach was used for data collection and the NVivo (v. 12) qualitative software was employed in identifying themes from the transcripts interview. The study reveals a range of perception about same-sex marriage including exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well as HIV/AIDS, and the challenge of procreation which remains a sacrosanct need of marriage. Social implication reveals a taboo to existing cultural tradition, norms, values and customs of the Yoruba cultural society and a blasphemy to religion which can trigger societal unrest. The legal implication uncovered include that same sex exudes a danger to public morality, with 14 years imprisonments for offenders and 10 years for accomplices.

"Who is seen to be doing business research, and does it really matter? Gender representation at academic conferences","Walters, Trudie; Hassanli, Najmeh; Finkler, Wiebke","PurposeGender inequality is evident in many academic practices, but research has often focused on the male-dominated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. This study responds to calls for more work in the business disciplines which have been overlooked by comparison and focuses on academic conferences as a higher education practice. Conferences are manifestations of the research being conducted within the discipline, representing the type of knowledge that is considered valuable, and who the thought leaders are considered to be. This study investigates whether equal representation of women at such conferences really matters, to whom and why.Design/methodology/approachThe research was designed using a critical feminist theory approach. An online survey was disseminated to academic staff and postgraduate students in the 25 top ranked business schools in Australia and New Zealand. A total of 452 responses were received, and thematic analysis was applied to open-ended responses.FindingsEqual representation does matter, for two sets of reasons. The first align with feminist theory perspectives of “equal opportunity” (gender is neutral), “difference” (gender is celebrated) or “post-equity” (the social construction of gender itself is problematic). The second are pragmatic consequences, namely the importance of role modelling, career building and the respect and recognition that come with conference attendance and visible leadership roles.Social implicationsThe findings have implications in regards to job satisfaction, productivity and the future recruitment and retention of women in academia. Furthermore, in areas where women are not researching, the questions and issues that are important to them are not receiving the attention they deserve, and this gender data gap has consequences for society at large.Originality/valueThis study moves beyond simply identifying the under-representation of women at academic conferences in yet another field, to investigate why equal representation is important and to whom.

As predicted, we found that women report high perceived disadvantage when men are targeted for nursing. However, we show that a gender asymmetry exists such that men and women respond differently when targeted for occupations in which they are typically the minority gender. Specifically, men targeted for nursing positions respond with more perceived disadvantage than do women being recruited to police positions.

"Men Should Be Competent, Women Should Have it All: Multiple Criteria in the Evaluation of Female Job Candidates","Moscatelli, Silvia; Menegatti Michela; Ellemers Naomi; Mariani, Marco Giovanni; Rubini, Monica","The present research investigated whether evaluations of female and male job candidates rely on different dimensions. Going beyond previous studies on the role of gender stereotypes, we examined the relative importance of competence, morality, and sociability in employment decisions. In Study 1, we content-analyzed 68 archival reports of professionals to explore the extent to which they spontaneously referred to the three dimensions in evaluations of women and men. In Study 2, 259 Italian student participants rated the importance of different traits in hiring a female or male candidate for a job position. Additionally, we tested the relative influence of specific information about candidate competence and morality in predicting hiring (Study 3; n = 123 Italian students) and contract renewal (Study 4; n = 108 Italian students) decisions. Findings consistently showed that competence was the most important dimension in evaluations and decisions concerning male candidates, whereas all dimensions were important for female candidates. Moreover, decisions concerning women were influenced by the dimension on which they appeared to be relatively weak. Overall, findings suggest that women are evaluated against multiple criteria and might therefore be asked to meet more requirements than men to be selected and make a career. These findings can help evaluators and decision makers adopt assessment strategies that prevent more critical evaluations of women, such as establishing specific evaluation criteria before the disclosure of a candidate’s gender.",2020,,Sex Roles,83,5-6,269-288,2430245448,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-019-01111-2,,#419,Moscatelli 2020,"",""

This study analyzes business leaders’ attitudes toward gender and leadership positions after a gender quota law for company boards was implemented in 2013. We explore support for gender quotas and whether it is related to how respondents explain women's underrepresentation in leadership positions. A questionnaire was sent to 1,349 managers in the 250 largest companies in Iceland. Our findings indicate that women are more supportive of gender quotas than men. The way in which the respondents explain the underrepresentation of women as top managers is strongly related to their support for gender quotas. Those who believe that women are structurally disadvantaged are more likely to support gender quotas than those who adhere to individual explanations.

The theory of masculinities underpins making sense of the persisting, highly skewed, gendered division of labour and inequality in the mining sector. The snow-ball sampling method was employed to select participants. Content analysis was used to analyse data. The study shows that the mining sector remains highly masculine oriented. Women are still underrepresented in various sections of the mining sector. The study shows changing perceptions with the majority of participants believing that women are equally if not more capable than men, even in areas that have traditionally been considered a male preserve. However, some men, who work in seemingly dangerous areas of the mine, expressed that working in the mining sector is dangerous and unhealthy for women. Furthermore, most female participants decry that the protective clothing in the mines is still designed to suit the male body and that there are no sanitary facilities to accommodate women's needs especially in the mineshafts. Lastly, some participants highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment in the mines which victims are afraid to expose. The study recommends the need for the development of a gender policy that should guide mainstreaming of gender in every component of the mining sector system. This should include the development of a recruitment policy that should take into consideration affirmative action measures to increase women representation in mining; a sexual harassment policy that has proper implementation strategies; and sanitary facilities and uniform that will suit gender needs.",2020,,"Gender & Behaviour, suppl.

Aspects associated with sexualised drug use among gay men and other men who have sex with men: a cross-sectional study from the Latin America MSM Internet Survey 2018 – Chile,"Cristian Lisboa Donoso; Ávila, Valeria Stuardo","Background: Sexualised drug use has attracted interest due to the role it could play in increasing exposure to the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections. It also carries risks inherent to substance use and may influence psychosocial factors. This study characterised sexualised drug use among Latin America MSM Internet Survey (LAMIS) respondents in Chile, in order to identify aspects associated with the phenomenon. Methods: LAMIS data were used to analyse: drug use (in any context, in sexual context and sexualised drug use), epidemiological aspects and psychosocial aspects. In addition, the associations between the sexualised drug use and these aspects were estimated. Results: The prevalence of sexualised drug use was 24% (n = 4945). The drugs most used in a sexual context (n = 3365) were cannabis, poppers and viagra. Cocaine, ecstasy/MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and ketamine use were reported in sexual encounters with multiple partners. Living with HIV (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92), having had sex with three or more casual partners in the past year (AOR = 2.02) and having engaged in sex without a condom with three or more casual partners in this period (AOR = 1.61) were aspects associated with sexualised drug use. Less social integration (AOR = 0.76) and internalised homonegativity (AOR = 0.85) were aspects associated with a decrease of possibility of practising sexual drug use.

The results of logistic regression analyses with rare events correction show no significant differences between men and women coaches in terms of being dismissed following poor team performance. Hence, the theoretical assumptions of the gender stereotypes and role congruity literature could not be supported empirically. However, the results indicate that women coaches are significantly more likely to be hired as new coaches following poor performance of a team in terms of wins and winning percentage (but not losses) over the course of a season, providing some empirical support for a glass cliff in coaching.

"Making it like a man: Men, masculinities, and the modern career : A conference report","Bland, Clarice","Male homosociability is still a prevalent aspect of working culture and although many women are now participating in these same circles, it is still largely centred around the idea that men’s groupings are the ones that dictate the professional environment. The conference Making it Like a Man: Men, Masculinities and the Modern Career, which took place at the University of Helsinki on the 25th and 26th of October 2018, illuminated this idea by introducing new perspectives on the connection between men and careers. The conference was necessary because merely acknowledging the divide in work environments between men and women does not show the connection between masculinity and careers, and neither how masculinity manifests itself in a variety of ways and socio-economic structures. Although the presentations stemmed from academic research, the language and structure of the conference was such that it was accessible for anybody from any background.

Bringing Party Ideology Back In: Do Left-Wing Parties Enhance the Share of Women MPs?,"Santana, Andrés; Aguilar, Susana","This article analyzes the relationship between parties and the representation of women in Spanish subnational legislatures. We argue that studies on party ideology and gender have generally failed to (a) acknowledge the effect of electoral time: the left started to recruit women earlier, when their number was low and they were mainly perceived as liabilities; and (b) distinguish between two different party mechanisms: parties can be gate openers and ease the access of newcomers to the legislature, and they can be career promoters, which facilitate the parliamentary continuity of incumbents. Drawing on a database containing comprehensive information about the population of regional members of parliament (MPs) (N = 5,353) in 138 elections and focusing on the two most prominent parties, the conservative People's Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party), we test the hypothesis that left-wing parties outperform right-wing parties concerning gender representation. Our statistical analyses show that electoral time blurs the effect of ideology on the share of women MPs. Once time is controlled for, the socialists emerge as systematically recruiting more women.

Assessment of De-Radicalization Hypothesis in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Norman, Ishmael D","This study considers de-radicalization hypothesis in relation to the youth of Sub-Saharan Africa and the purported re-training from engagement in violent extremism. The hypothesis assumes a waning or reduction in youth radicalism in Sub-Saharan Africa. This change is reported to be due to the reduced opportunities for recruitment into violent extremist groups, through proselytization in the virtual or real world. The instigators are Muslim Clerics, or Jihadist agents, or even through 'Self-radicalization'. The reduced effect is, apparently, attributed to the successes garnered by the international war on terror. For proof of concept of youth radicalism, and therefore, deradicalism, a review of the reported motivations of the youth to jihadist causes was conducted. This was to assess if those motivations are still prevalent in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa's. If so, can the argument be sustained that, once there was active radicalism and now, there is de-radicalism? The evidence on de-radicalization of the youth even in Europe and in Sub-Saharan Africa as reported by observers and security organizations in Sub-Saharan Africa and else, is not compatible with the quantum of the youth from Sub-Saharan Africa believed to have been radicalized. Among other weaknesses it fails to establish a baseline, and, thereafter, the percentage of change of those de-radicalized.

Education Crises as Crises for Capital,"Rikowski, Glenn","Accounts of education crises typically start out from the notion that these are derivative of economic crises. Hard times for capitalist economies - with recession and consequent shortfalls in tax takes as unemployment rises - leads to cutbacks in budgets for state services, including education. The victims of these cuts are schools, colleges, universities, and students (as provision is trimmed) and staffs (redundancies, recruitment freezes and restructurings). This is The Classical Theory of Education Crisis. A critique of this perspective on education crisis is outlined in this article. Alternatively, it is argued that education crises can be crises for capital, where capitalist development in education institutions becomes threatened or terminated. Through the analysis of commodity forms, the conditions for education crises generating crises for capital are demonstrated. In this perspective, it is capital that is the victim. It is argued that when conscious attempts to go beyond existing forms of capitalist education are forged along anti-capitalist lines in alternative, oppositional educational organisations, then this poses the most threatening scenario for capital and its human representatives.

Egyptian women supervisory empowerment behaviors on well-being outcomes,"El-Kot, Ghada; Burke, Ronald J; Fiksenbaum, Lisa M","PurposeThis paper aims to examine the relationship of perceived supervisor empowerment behaviors and feelings of personal empowerment with important work and well-being outcomes in a sample of Egyptian women managers and professionals.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 155 managerial and professional women using anonymously completed questionnaires. Respondents were relatively young; had university educations; had the short job and organizational tenures; held various levels of management jobs; and worked in a range of functions. All measures used here had been used and validated previously by other researchers.FindingsWork outcomes included job satisfaction, career satisfaction, work engagement, work-family and family-work conflict, emotional exhaustion/burnout, life satisfaction and intent to quit. Both perceived levels of supervisory/leader empowerment behaviors and self-reported feelings of empowerment had significant relationships with the majority of work and well-being outcomes.Research limitations/implicationsData were collected using self-report questionnaires with the small risk of response set and common method biases. Second, all data were collected at one point in time making it challenging to address issues of causality. Third, all respondents came from the two largest cities in Egypt, Cairo and Alexandria; thus, the extent to which our findings would generalize to managerial and professional women and men is indeterminate.

Practical applications include training supervisors on empowerment behaviors, and training all employees on the benefits of personal empowerment and efficacy and ways to increase them.Social implicationsA number of ways to increase levels of empowerment of both front-line employees and managers have been identified. These include increasing employee participation in decision-making, delegating authority and control to these employees, creating more challenging work roles through job redesign, leaders sharing more information and leaders providing more coaching and mentoring to their staff.

Defensible decisions: Balancing employer and prospective employee rights in an era of criminal background checks,"Kurlychek, Megan; Bushway, Shawn; Denver, Megan","PurposeEmployers using criminal background checks to make hiring determinations must carefully balance the need to protect themselves and their clients against legal mandates designed to protect the rights of individuals with criminal records. Yet, surprisingly little research examines this balancing act. The purpose of this paper is to examine how one large agency, the New York Department of Health (DOH), navigates a myriad of mandates to convey and create legitimacy in compliance with complex legal mandates and contrasting interests.Design/methodology/approachPrior research on civil right legislation suggests that while companies may create regulations that appear to comply with such mandates, their actual practice does not always comply with their own rules (Dobbin et al., 1988). Therefore, this study addresses two key questions: do the DOH policies appear to comply with the relevant New York State law and does the DOH effectively implement the policies in a way that upholds New York State law. Specifically, this study estimates probit models on a sample of over 7,000 potential employees with criminal records to determine compliance with the criteria established by law and policy.FindingsFindings show that the variables indicated by law/regulations such as offense severity and time since conviction work in the intended direction. Using only these criteria the models are able to correctly predict clearance decisions approximately of the time and that extra-legal factors such as race and gender do not further influence final determinations.Practical implicationsThese findings have practical implications for employers as they show that it is possible for employers to design formal rules that navigate this complex landscape while still opening up employment opportunities for individuals with criminal records.Originality/valueThis is important as many employers either utilize criminal background checks without regulation or are fearful of embarking on efforts to meet regulations such as those promulgated by the EEOC.

In the first study, 280 professionals with hiring experience indicate how various criminal offenses, described as having occurred either within the past year or several years ago, would affect their evaluation of an applicant for a call center position. In the second study, a separate sample of 109 practitioners evaluates criminal as well as non-criminal transgressions that might appear on a background report.FindingsIn Study 1, both the apparent seriousness of an offense and its recency influence modal responses. Even non-violent misdemeanors from several years ago, however, are judged as automatically disqualifying by some participants.

Reducing a Male Bias in Language? Establishing the Efficiency of Three Different Gender-Fair Language Strategies,"Lindqvist, Anna; Renström, Emma Aurora; Marie Gustafsson Sendén","Different strategies of gender-fair language have been applied to reduce a male bias, which means the implicit belief that a word describing an undefined person describes a man. This male bias might be caused by the words themselves in terms of generic masculine or masculine forms or by androcentrism (the conflation of men with humanity). In two experiments, we tested how different gender-fair strategies used as labels of an unknown social target (an applicant in a recruitment situation) could eliminate the male bias. The three types of gender-fair strategies tested were: (a) paired forms (he/she), (b) traditional neutral words (e.g., singular they, “the applicant”), or (c) gender-neutral third-person pronouns actively created to challenge the binary gender system (ze, Swedish hen). The two experiments were performed in Swedish with 417 undergraduates in Sweden and in English with 411 U.S. participants recruited online. In Swedish, the third-person gender-neutral pronoun singular (hen) was used. In English, several forms of such gender-neutral pronouns have been suggested (e.g., ze). In both experiments, results indicated that paired forms and actively created gender-neutral pronouns eliminated the male bias, whereas traditional neutral words contained a male bias. Thus, gender-fair language strategies should avoid using traditional words. Consequences of using paired forms and creating new gender-neutral words are discussed. We argue that an actively created gender-neutral pronoun is of highest value because it is more inclusive.",2019,,Sex Roles,81,1-2,109-117,2120013277,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0974-9,,#440,Lindqvist 2019,"",""
The Effect of Evaluator Masculinity on Dyadic Hiring Decisions,"Rice, Lindsay; Greenlee, Eric T","Research examining gender disparities in the workplace tends to focus on individual behavior rather than the behavior of teams or dyads, yet important workplace decisions such as hiring and promotion decisions are often made by more than one person.

Participants were recruited in pairs and given measures to assess their self-agreement with masculine characteristics before evaluating the résumés of two candidates for a student government position. Path analyses revealed that the opinion of each dyad member was predictive of the group decision, but the more masculine member of the dyad had more influence on both the evaluation of the candidates and the hiring decision.

In two experiments, male participants evaluated résumés from male and female job candidates applying for a managerial position. Across experiments, results suggest that lacking power may facilitate biased hiring decisions. U.S. college men assigned to (Experiment 1, n = 83) or primed (Experiment 2, n = 84) with a low-power role rated the female applicant as less hireable and recommended a lower salary for her compared to the male applicant.

Far from the Factory? Investigating how women travel to work in rural Cote d'Ivoire,"Grover, Rijak","Sociologists have long argued that spatial mismatch, or costs for workers associated with the distance from home to work, determines the extensive margin of labour supply of urban areas in developed countries (Kain 1968; Wilson, 1987). But what about in rural contexts where labour supply vastly exceeds demand? Using data from fieldwork in Findon2, Cote d'Ivoire, this article examines an unexplored aspect of spatial mismatch theory, namely, its application to a rural context in the developing world. Sociological research has suggested the best way to correct spatial mismatch is by either bringing people to jobs or jobs to people. The cashew processing firms of CAFAC3 have brought jobs to people by locating their factories in secondary towns and cities around Cote d'Ivoire, hiring workers from the surrounding rural areas. An estimated ninety-five percent of these workers are women. Qualitative evidence from interviews provides new insights into how far these women travel to work in an attempt to see if the spatial mismatch has been corrected by CAFAC.

It’s complicated: a multi-method approach to broadening participation in STEM,"Valerie Gray Hardcastle; Furst-Holloway, Stacie; Kallen, Rachel; Jacquez, Farrah","PurposeA lot is known about systemic barriers to broadening participation (BP) in STEM. Empirical research has demonstrated the existence and impact of implicit bias, stereotype threat, and micro-aggressions on a sense of belonging, organizational productivity and leadership opportunities. We also know that achieving greater participation of women and faculty of color in the STEM disciplines is complicated and depends on altering complex and multi-layered interactions between activities and actors. Further, because researcher and institutional goals vary as a function of target population and context, generalizable models can struggle in the face of larger BP efforts. Through the authors experience as an NSF ADVANCE-IT awardee, the authors believe that a dynamic, multi-scaled and organizational level approach is required to reflect the reciprocal dialogue among research questions, best practices, tailored applications and quantifiable goals. The authors describe several examples of research, programming activities and program evaluation that illustrate this approach. In particular, the authors describe both the programming successes and challenges, with the aim of helping others to avoid common mistakes by articulating very broad and, the authors’ hope, generalizable “lessons learned.” The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo better understand the barriers for women in STEM, the authors utilized an iterative methodology. Specifically, the authors conducted a social network analysis, an exit survey of departed faculty, longitudinal analysis of career trajectories and research productivity, and a survey on the interaction between values and climate.FindingsThe analyses suggest three strategies better retain women in STEM: improve women’s professional networks; re-aling policy documents and departmental practices to better reflect faculty values; and improve departmental climate.Practical implicationsThe pay-off for using this more complex research approach to triangulate onto specific challenges is that the interventions are more likely to be successful, with a longer-lasting impact.Originality/valueWith continuous institutional research, metric refinement, and program evaluation the authors are better able to develop targeted programming, policy reform, and changes in institutional practice.

An Insight to Women in Construction for Fostering Female Careers in Sri Lankan Construction Industry,"Vijayaragunathan, Srivishagan; Rasanthi, Thalpage","The construction industry is one of the largest sectors in Sri Lanka.

However, the Sri Lankan construction industry is facing technical and managerial skill shortages as well as worker capacity issues. Further, the industry is facing industrial issues such as delivering timely project completion, within budget and for desired quality. 'Women in construction' has been a topic of concern by many nations, for many years. Given the rapid growth and demand in the construction sector, there has been an incremental increase in the participation of women in construction but this is still relatively minor when compared with other fields such as manufacturing, administration or academic. According to Sri Lankan vocational education reports, though there are around 40 percent of students enrolled in local technical colleges are female, over 70 percent of them are applying for nontechnical and culturally accepted feminine courses such as home science, dressmaking, beauty culture and secretarial courses. Aditionally, since gender differentiation occurs in local industries, women are significantly underrepresented in technical fields such as construction and there are observable social barriers to entry including the physical demands of construction work, male construction worker behavior and social stereotyping of construction as a male occupation.

Missing or seizing the opportunity?

School context: implications for teachers of color,"Madsen, Jean; Mabokela, Reitumetse Obakeng; Luevanos, Elisabeth A","PurposeBy 2026, students of color will make up 54 percent of the school-age population. Literature on recruiting and retaining teachers of color reveal that teachers of color are underrepresented in US schools (Castro et al., 2018). Cultural differences between teachers and students result in higher number of students of color being expelled or suspended, low graduation rates and lower numbers of students of color in advanced math, science and gifted courses. With an emphasis on retaining teachers of color the purpose of this paper is to examine how traditional school contexts play a role in teacher retention.Design/methodology/approachThis was a qualitative case study that examined white teachers’ perceptions about their interactions with African American teachers (Merriam, 1998). A case study was useful in describing the boundaries of the school and how this type of context allowed the researchers to explore intergroup differences between both groups of teachers (Hays and Singh, 2011). Nine white teachers from predominantly white schools in the USA were interviewed (Seidman, 1998). The data were analyzed using what Glaser and Strauss (1967) call a constant comparative method. This process compared the intergroup theory with teachers’ responses.FindingsFindings indicated that white teachers had little or no experience interacting with people who were racially and culturally different from them. Because of their curiosity about race, African American teachers were categorized as the “black expert.” White teachers asked them to speak with African American parents, give expertise on areas of discipline and chair multicultural events. Group boundaries developed rapidly as white teachers overwhelmed teachers of color with only their racial problems. African American teachers were forced into roles, which prevented them from contributing in other areas. Thus, African American teachers grew tired of only playing one aspect of their teaching.Research limitations/implicationsUpon entering their schools, teachers bring with them a broad array of experiences, knowledge, skills and abilities. This results in a form of assimilation where they become like-minded to their schools’ norms and values. As incoming teachers of color enter with different norms and culture, they mediate boundaries having both groups of teachers adjust to cultural differences (Madsen and Mabokela, 2013). Intergroup differences often occur due to changing demographics in schools. If teachers cannot work through these normative conflicts, it will be reflected in teacher turnover, absences, workplace disagreements and teachers of color leaving.Practical implicationsIf the focus is to recruit teachers of color, there needs to be an emphasis on preparing leaders on how to identify and address intergroup differences. As in Bell’s (2002) study and Achinstein’s (2002) research, when teachers have differences it will have influence how teachers will collaborate. Thus, teachers of color are prevented from sharing their philosophy about teaching students of color. These individuals also share the burden of being the only person who can advocate for students of color, but also serve as cultural translators for other students as well.Social implicationsFuture educators not only need to understand how to teach demographically diverse students, but it is important for them to understand how multicultural capital plays an inclusive role in getting all students to do academically well. The question becomes of how one teaches the importance of “humanistic” commitments for all children.Originality/valueBooysen (2014) believes that identity and workplace identity research only allows for integration of divergent perspectives. More study is needed to understand how do workers navigate their identity through the workplace. Workplace identity among group members results in power discrepancies and assimilation verses the preservation of micro cultural identity. Thus, both groups often have competing goals and there is a struggle for resources. Cox (1994) believes that these tensions cause group members to center on preserving of their own culture. Hence, groups are more aware of their need to protect their cultural identity which ultimately affects retention of workers.",2019,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",38,1,56-70,2177147021,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-02-2018-0031,,#461,Madsen 2019,"",""
Female underrepresentation in project-based organizations exposes organizational isomorphism,"Baker, Marzena; French, Erica","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the structural career barriers in project-based construction and property development organizations in Australia, and explore how these affect women and their project careers.

Gendering expert work and ideal candidacy in Finnish and Estonian job advertisements,"Jännäri, Jatta; Poutanen, Seppo; Kovalainen, Anne","PurposeThis paper aims to analyse the ways the textual materials of job advertisements do the gendering for prospective expert positions and create a space for ambiquity/non-ambiquity in the gender labelling of this expertise. Expert positions are almost always openly announced and are important to organizations because they often lead to higher managerial positions. By gendering the prospective positions, the job advertisements bring forth repertoires strengthening the gendering of work and gendered expert employee positions.Design/methodology/approachThis study draws on qualitative textual and visual data of open job advertisements for expert positions. The materials of the study are gathered from open job advertisements in two countries, i.e. Finland and Estonia with rather similar labour market structures in relation to gender positions but differing as regards their gender equality.FindingsThe analyses show that the gendering of expert work takes place in the job advertisements by rendering subtly gendered articulations, yet allowing for interpretative repertoires appear. The analysis reveals some differences in the formulations of the advertisements for expert jobs in the two countries. It also shows that in general the requirements for an ideal expert candidate are coated with superlatives that are gendered in rather stereotypical ways, and that the ideal candidates for highly expert jobs are extremely flexible and follows the ideal of an adaptable and plastic employee, willing to work their utmost. This paper contributes to the “doing gender” literature by adding an analysis of the textual gendering of ideal candidates for positions of expertise.Research limitations/implicationsThe research materials do not expose all the issues pertinent to questions of the ideal gendered candidate. For instance, questions of ethnicity in relation to the definition of the ideal candidate cannot be studied with the data used for this study.

When Job Ads Turn You Down: How Requirements in Job Ads May Stop Instead of Attract Highly Qualified Women,"Wille, Lien; Derous, Eva","Qualification-based targeted recruitment strategies aim to increase the number of qualified applicants from certain social groups, such as women. Typically, such strategies assume that individuals are more likely to apply for a job when they possess the requirements needed for that job. However, how job seekers react to requirements in job ads is not often considered and is explored in the present study. In two experimental studies with Belgian university students we investigated whether person requirements about which women have negative meta-stereotypes (like the trait of emotionality) and the way such requirements are formulated in job ads (i.e., using trait-like adjectives, “You are calm/not nervous,” or behavior-like verbs, “You remain calm in stressful situations”) affected women’s job attraction and decision to apply. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that job attraction was lower if women held negative meta-stereotypes about required personality traits in job ads (Study 1; 218 women; Mage = 23.44 years, range = 21–42; 97% ethnic majorities). Moreover, qualified women applied to a lesser extent if a negatively meta-stereotyped trait was worded in a trait-like way than when it was worded in a behavior-like way (Study 2; n = 183; Mage = 23.68 years, range = 21–44; 58% women; 97% ethnic majorities).

To explain this variation, scholars cannot focus exclusively on women (e.g., how do women respond to formal institutional opportunities?) or femininity (e.g., how do norms governing appropriate female behavior affect women's odds of being selected as a candidate?). Rather, scholars must attend to the ways that informal norms regarding masculinity operate across space and time within a country. Drawing on the insights of feminist institutionalism, this essay examines two intracountry sources of variation in candidate selection: the spatial urban-rural divide and temporal differences between first-time recruitment and renomination.

"“The Heart Desires but the Body Refuses”: Sexual Scripts, Older Men’s Perceptions of Sexuality, and Implications for Their Mental and Sexual Health","Sylivia, Karen Rutagumirwa; Bailey, Ajay","We use sexual scripting theory in the present paper to gain a better understanding of older men’s perceptions of their sexuality in relation to dominant Tanzanian cultural norms of masculinity. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 older men, and ten focus group discussions were conducted with 60 men aged 60–82. Participants’ recruitment was guided by theoretical sampling strategies. Consistent with the principles of grounded theory, data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Our findings indicate that Jando (male initiation rites) serves as a script for male sexuality that outlines the expectations and rewards of male sexuality. Adhering to masculine sexual script affects older men’s perceptions of their sexuality in later life and has detrimental effects on their well-being. Older men were concerned with changes in their sexual life, such as the decline in their sexual performance. The majority of the participants said they felt emotionally distressed about the age-related decline in their body and in their sexuality, and they reported that their inability to conform to male sexual scripts undermined their sense of masculinity. Several of the participants reported that in an effort to regain their previous sexual performance, they had turned to remedies and strategies of questionable appropriateness and effectiveness.

Are Men Better Leaders? An Investigation of Head Coaches’ Gender and Individual Players’ Performance in Amateur and Professional Women’s Basketball,"Darvin, Lindsey; Pegoraro, Ann; Berri, David","Male-dominated industries such as sport contain stereotypical and subjective notions of leadership ability (Burton et al. 2009; Fink 2008). These gender stereotypes often manifest themselves within varying levels of leadership, but specific to the sport industry, they are the most visible within the head coach role. Men hold the majority of head coach positions within the professional and amateur levels of sport, and these hiring practices can be based on gender-role stereotypes (Acosta and Carpenter 2014). In an attempt to challenge stereotypical gender based leadership preferences, leadership ability and performance should be objectively examined. Therefore, in the present investigation we aimed to examine the presence of gender stereotypes in the sport industry by determining whether the gender of a head coach for two women’s basketball leagues, the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the National Intercollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), impacted individual player performance. Data were collected for 1522 players for 19 WNBA seasons (1997–2015) and 4000 players for three seasons of NCAA Women’s Basketball (2013–2016).

What Makes Muslim Women Entrepreneurs Successful? A Field Study Examining Religiosity and Social Capital in Tunisia,"Baranik, Lisa E; Gorman, Brandon; Wales, William J","The present study sheds light upon critical factors that help explain the entrepreneurial success among Muslim women living in a democratic Tunisia, a Muslim-majority country considered by many to be the lone Arab Spring success story. We hypothesized that successful entrepreneurs need social capital, including the capital that comes from marriage and high levels of wasta (the Arabic concept of having personal connections with influential others). Moreover, given the lack of empirical attention paid to the role of the culture, language, and customs associated with Islam on women’s empowerment, we examine whether religiosity is related to entrepreneurial performance among Tunisian women. Data collected with 84 female entrepreneurs participating in entrepreneurship training programs across Tunisia reveal that two forms of social capital, marital status and wasta, are related to training center directors’ ratings of women entrepreneurs’ performance, suggesting that social capital is a critical asset for Muslim women entrepreneurs. Religiosity, on the other hand, had no statistically significant relationship with entrepreneurial performance. Our study contributes to research on entrepreneurship by identifying wasta as a form of social capital that may be necessary for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the Middle East and North Africa and by taking an initial step towards better understanding the empirical (and controversial) relationship between religiosity and career success among Muslim women.

"Diversity, disparate impact, and discrimination pursuant to Title VII of US civil rights laws","Cavico, Frank J; Mujtaba, Bahaudin","PurposeWhile the words diversity, disparate impact, and discrimination are commonly read and heard by working adults and professionals, they can at times be confusing and fearful to some managers. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of a specific aspect of US civil rights laws – the disparate impact theory. The authors provide an analysis based on the statute, case law interpreting, and applying the statute, administrative guidelines from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as legal and management commentary. The paper illustrates the requirements of a plaintiff employee’s initial case based on the disparate impact theory. The challenging causation component which requires some degree of statistical evidence is given particular attention. Limitations to the paper are stated at the beginning; and recommendations to managers are explored and provided toward the end of the paper.Design/methodology/approachIt is a legal paper which covers all the laws related to discrimination based on disparate impact and disparate treatment theories. Actual court cases up until this month and Americans laws related to this concept are reviewed and critically discussed.FindingsThe salient feature of disparate impact is that this legal theory allows a plaintiff job applicant or employee to sustain a case of illegal discrimination without providing any evidence of a discriminatory motive. As opposed to the disparate treatment liability is imposed based on disproportionate adverse results and not discriminatory intent.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper deals with the disparate impact theory pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. However, it must be pointed out that the disparate impact theory is also applicable to claims arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Since the focus of this paper is Title VII federal and state constitutional issues, such as the applicability of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause that may arise in disparate impact cases involving government entities will not be addressed.Practical implicationsManagers and employees can protect themselves in the workplace from illegal discriminatory practices. Initially, employers and managers must be aware of the distinction between a disparate impact case and a disparate treatment case with the latter requiring evidence of intentional discrimination. Evidence, of course, can be direct or circumstantial or inferential. Whereas in a disparate impact case there is no intentional discrimination; and as such proof of discriminatory intent is not required. Rather, the employee has to present evidence that the employer’s neutral on-its-face employment policy or practice caused an adverse disproportionate impact on the employee as a member of a protected class.Social implicationsHuman resources professionals and managers must become educated in diversity laws in order to provide an inclusive workplace for all employees and candidates. Employers have legitimate areas of concern in hiring and promoting employees; and the courts are cognizant of employer responsibilities; and thus the employers must be able to show how specific knowledge, skills, education, training, backgrounds, as well as height, weight, strength, and dexterity are legitimate qualifications that directly relate to successful job performance.Originality/valueThis is an original paper by the authors.",2017,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",36,7,670-691,1956075215,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-04-2017-0091,,#479,Cavico 2017,"",""

An Intersectional Analysis of the Workplace Experiences of African American Female Athletic Directors,"Mcdowell, Jacqueline; Carter-francique, Akilah","Using intersectionality theory as a lens, the present study investigated the organizational experiences of African American women athletic directors. We use data collected from face-to-face interviews with ten African American women athletic directors of NCAA Division I, II, and III U.S. intercollegiate athletic departments. Findings of our investigation reveal that the intersection of their race and gender identities, in conjunction with societal and occupational stereotypes, resulted in many of them working in environments where they faced constant challenges to their identity and authority in response to social and occupational stereotypes, misperceptions concerning their leadership roles, and perceptions that their hiring is more a result of their demographics than of their qualifications. We highlight the importance of recognizing how stereotypes intersect to produce differential experiences, and we seek to increase awareness of how implicit stereotyping influences the thoughts and behaviors of African American women athletic directors and also the individuals interacting with them.

Findings The AFL, as an organization, has a high percentage of indigenous players (employees) in comparison to the wider Australian workforce representation. Largely, indigenous representation within the AFL is merit based, prioritized on an individual's ability to play football at an elite level. The website audit identified a number of inconsistencies in the public personas portrayed by the AFL and organizations aligned to it such as the AFL Players Association and clubs.

Additionally, they are subject to a number of health risks, such as increased risk of HIV infection, substance abuse and illicit use of cross gender hormones. Their health risks are further aggravated by a lack of targeted health programmes and limited number of health care workers (HCW) who are skilled in transgender health.The aim of the study was to uncover the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the HCW towards the transgender patients' sexual and reproductive health. An exploratory, descriptive and contextual qualitative design was employed. This methodology was considered appropriate because little is known regarding what drives the observed actions of HCW towards the transgender patients in the South African health care setting. Thirteen HCW participated in one on one semi-structured interviews. Recruitment was stopped once data phases no longer contributed different themes or ideas to the analytical categories. Transgender health is not covered in the training of the HCW, thus knowledge and skills on transgender patients' needs is limited. The HCWs approach the care of the transgender patient with uncertainty, resulting in alienation of patients through poor relations. There is a paucity of information and research on the transgender population, making it a challenge to design guidelines and programmes. Cultural and religious beliefs were put forward by HCW as part of the reasons for difficult interaction with the transgender patients. Transgender health must be included in the pre- and post-service training curriculum of HCW.

Voting for Women in Belgium's Flexible List System,"Marien, Sofie; Schouteden, Anke; Wauters, Bram","Proportional electoral systems tend to be more beneficial for women's descriptive representation than majority systems. However, within proportional systems the gender equality of election outcomes differs, highlighting the importance of studying the actual use of electoral provisions in proportional representation (PR) systems. Therefore, we investigate the determinants of voting for female candidates in Belgium's local elections. This case is particularly interesting given the equal number of men and women on the candidate lists due to quota regulations, the possibility to cast multiple preference votes (lowering competition), and the high visibility of these local elections and its candidates. At the individual level, we find that women are more likely than men to vote for several women, yet same-sex voting is more common among men. Politically sophisticated respondents vote more often for candidates of both sexes. Against our expectations, a left-wing orientation does not increase the likelihood of voting for women.

However, clandestine abortion remains a serious health problem in Bangladesh, and anecdotal reports indicate that clandestine use of misoprostol has increased since the most recent estimates (for 2010). Because of this, it is important to assess changes in the use of MR services and the incidence of clandestine abortion since 2010. A survey of a nationally representative sample of829 health facilities that provide MR or postabortion care services and a survey of322 professionals knowledgeable about these services were conducted in 2014. Direct and indirect methods were applied to calculate the incidence of MR and induced abortion. In 2014, an estimated 1,194,000 induced abortions were performed in Bangladesh (29 per 1,000 women aged 15-49), and 257,000 women were treated for complications of such abortions (a rate of 6 per 1,000 women aged 15-49). Among women with complications, the proportion presenting with hemorrhage increased significantly, from 27% to 48%. An estimated 430,000 MR procedures (using MVA or medication) were performed in health facilities nationwide, a decline of about 40% in the MR rate-from 17 to 10 per 1,000 women aged 15-49-from 2010 to 2014.

Analyses revealed that applicants were more often selected for a position in which the occupation stereotype matched their gender suggesting an effect of an evaluator's gender role traditionalism. In addition, those participants indicating that they held more traditional gender role beliefs tended to favor male applicants in their evaluations.

RCT to estimate reduction in pain after laparoscopic surgery when using a combination therapy of intraperitoneal norma,"J E W van Dijk; Dedden, S J; P M A J Geomini; Meijer, P; N van Hanegem; Bongers, M Y","Background Shoulder pain and pain in the upper abdomen are common complaints after laparoscopy, sometimes surpassing the pain at incision sites. The incidence of shoulder pain ranges from 35 to 80%. Post-laparoscopic pain is caused by retention of carbon dioxide in the abdomen, which irritates the phrenic nerve and diaphragm, causing referred pain in the shoulder and in the upper abdomen. A promising strategy to reduce this post-laparoscopic pain is the pulmonary recruitment maneuver, which indirectly increases intraperitoneal pressure and thereby facilitates removal of residual carbon dioxide. An alternative strategy is the infusion of intraperitoneal normal saline. With normal saline infusion, carbon dioxide rises and escapes through the port sites. In addition, normal saline offers a physiologic buffer system to dissolve excess carbon dioxide. Methods/Design This multicenter randomized controlled trial is conducted in two teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Women between 18 and 65 years of age, with an ASA classification of I-II who are scheduled to undergo an elective laparoscopic procedure with benign gynecologic indication can participate. Following informed consent, participants are randomly allocated into two groups at the end of the surgical procedure. In the intervention group, the upper abdomen is filled with normal saline infusion with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. Then the anesthesiologist performs a standardized pulmonary recruitment maneuver with a pressure of 40 cm H2O. The trocar sleeve valves will be left open, so carbon dioxide can escape the abdominal cavity. With the patient in a neutral position the instruments are removed from the abdomen. In the control group, carbon dioxide is removed from the abdominal cavity at the end of surgery, with gentle abdominal pressure and passive exsufflation through the port sites, with open sleeve valves. The primary outcomes are the incidence and intensity of post-laparoscopic pain in the shoulder, upper abdomen and at the operation sites, at 8, 24 and 48 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes are postoperative use of analgesics, nausea, vomiting and pulmonary complications.

"Why Having a Family-Supportive Culture, Not Just Policies, Matters to Male and Female Job Seekers: An Examination of Work-Family Conflict, Values, and Self-Interest","Wayne, Julie Holliday; Casper, Wendy J","A common strategy to recruit job seekers, particularly women, is to develop and market a family-supportive workplace. We conducted two studies to investigate whether family-supportive policies and/or culture influenced organizational attractiveness, whether gender differences exist, and three theoretically based reasons why they might exist: (a) women anticipating or experiencing greater work-to-family conflict, (b) women having stronger family values, and (c) women expecting to benefit more from family-supportive practices than do men. In Study 1, 195 undergraduate students rated their attraction to a firm using a 3 (Type of Policy: dependent care assistance, flexible work arrangements, control) x 3 (Work-Family Culture: supportive, unsupportive, control) x 2 (Participant Gender) between-subjects design. A supportive work-family culture was associated with higher ratings of organizational attractiveness than was an unsupportive culture, and the effect was stronger for women. The effect of culture on organizational attractiveness was partially mediated by anticipated work-family conflict, but this mediation did not explain gender differences. In Study 2, we surveyed 255 job-seeking and working adults about the importance of family-supportive policies and culture to job choice. Participants rated a family-supportive culture as more important than policies to job choice, and women valued culture more than did men. The gender difference was explained by women's stronger belief that they would benefit from a family-supportive culture rather than differences in values or work-family conflict.

Recruitment included snowball and purposive sampling techniques. Analysis was conducted in tandem with data collection and focused on objectors' attitudes, beliefs and behaviors related to abortion and referral. Objectors had varied perspectives. Three types of objectors were evident: extreme, moderate and partial. Extreme objectors refused to perform abortions or make referrals, and often lectured their patients; they also provided misleading or false medical and legal information, preventing women from accessing abortions to which they were legally entitled. Moderate objectors would not perform abortions, but respected their patients and viewed referral as a way to save ""one out of two"" lives. Partial objectors performed some abortions but refused to do others on the basis of gestational age or case-by-case circumstances.

The purpose of this paper is to examine strategical reasons to diversify in different education teams in relation to two different diversity practices: attraction and selection of culturally diverse lecturers and utilization of cultural differences in team interaction.Design/methodology/approachIn a qualitative study the authors conducted 19 interviews with educational professionals in six different education teams in a university of applied sciences.FindingsInterviews with 19 members of six educational teams revealed that some teams acknowledge they need more diversity and exchange of knowledge and skills in order to meet the requirements of the labor market. Especially teams that prepare students for international careers foster this “Integration and Learning” perspective. Other teams, e.g. the Law team, notice less changes in labor market requirements. Still, these teams were open for recruiting diverse lecturers and found it important, especially to meet the needs of the diversity in students (access perspective). They also found value in the interaction and mutual learning in their team, but saw no extra value of diversity (colorblind perspective). Labor market demands for diversity seem to have more influence on the diversity perspective of teams than the diversity in the student population.Practical implicationsSince earlier research has shown that the diversity practices of organizations are more effective when they are in line with their diversity perspective, the differences between teams suggest that when dealing with diversity issues, universities can best work toward a common understanding of the importance of diversity but leave room for team differences in diversity practices.Originality/valueMost studies on diversity management assume or argue that organizations adopt one diversity perspective.

Hiring Decisions: The Effect of Evaluator Gender and Gender Stereotype Characteristics on the Evaluation of Job Applicants,"Rice, Lindsay; Barth, Joan M","This study examined how the gender and gender stereotype characteristics of an evaluator influenced a hypothetical hiring decision, and the effects of automatically activating gender stereotypes prior to a hiring decision. One hundred and twenty-nine undergraduates (80 female) completed a priming manipulation that activated gender stereotype-congruent or stereotype-incongruent associations, followed by an evaluation of a male or female job applicant. Results indicated that the gender and masculinity of an evaluator were related to the evaluations. After stereotype-congruent priming, men rated male applicants higher than female applicants and men's masculinity was associated with less favorable ratings. After stereotype-incongruent priming, male participants extended a more positive evaluation toward female applicants than when stereotype-congruent gender ideas were primed. Female participants were less affected by the priming and showed more egalitarian evaluations.

A US national sample of HIV-negative men was enrolled via an established online panel of over 22,000 GBM. Participants (n=1071) passed three milestones to join our panel. Milestone 1 was screening eligible and providing informed consent. Milestone 2 involved completing an hour-long at-home computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) survey. Milestone 3 involved completing at-home self-administered rapid HIV testing and collecting/returning urine and rectal samples for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing. Compared to those who completed milestones: Those not passing milestone 1 were more likely to be non-White and older; those not passing milestone 2 were less likely to have insurance or a primary care physician; and those not passing milestone 3 were less educated, more likely to be bisexual as opposed to gay, more likely to live in the Midwest, had fewer male partners in the past year, and less likely to have tested for HIV in the past year. Effect sizes for significant findings were small. We successfully enrolled a national sample of HIV-negative GBM who completed at-home CASI assessments and at-home self-administered HIV and urine and rectal STI testing.

Findings – Perceived organizational justice and the social-focussed value universalism contributed significantly in explaining variance in perceived discrimination against immigrants in the workplace. Employees who scored low on perceived organizational justice scored high on perceived discrimination against immigrants, and employees who scored high on the value universalism scored high on perceived discrimination against immigrants in the workplace.

"Revealing the ""Secret Garden"": The Informal Dimensions of Political Recruitment","Bjarnegård, Elin; Kenny, Meryl","Candidate selection and recruitment has been notably described as the ""secret garden"" of politics--an obscure process, often hidden from view, that is regulated largely by internal party rules, informal practices, and power relationships (cf. Gallagher and Marsh 1988). In this contribution, we contend that informal party practices and their gendered consequences are critically important for understanding the continuity of male political dominance and female underrepresentation. Rather than make a strict separation between formal and informal rules in the recruitment process, we argue that gender politics scholars must instead identify and empirically investigate the specific combinations of such rules that impact upon women's and men's political participation in parties.

What Makes a Good Politician? Reassessing the Criteria Used for Political Recruitment,"Murray, Rainbow","Certain societal groups are significantly overrepresented within politics, including men, ethnic majority groups, and socioeconomic elites. This has fueled debates regarding meritocracy within political recruitment. While meritocracy is desirable, its definition and measurement are contested. The criteria used in theoretical and empirical academic studies differ from those of political parties and voters, as discussed below. Furthermore, there is bias in favor of the male status quo, with all groups preferring the qualities of existing elites. The definition of a ""good"" politician is therefore highly subjective. Nonetheless, political traditionalists claim that the ""best"" candidate should be selected even if this leads to significant gender imbalance in parliaments. Yet, if political recruitment is biased in favor of social elites, the overrecruitment of men may not derive solely from merit (Murray 2014). Without definitive criteria for evaluating prospective candidates and judging those already elected, we cannot determine whether political recruitment is meritocratic.",2015,,Politics & Gender,11,4,770-776,1749295372,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X15000513,,#512,Murray 2015,"",""

Rules of Ministerial Recruitment,"Annesley, Claire","Ministerial office represents the pinnacle of political power. Quite rightly, politics and gender and comparative scholarship is paying increasing attention to women's access to political executives (Claveria 2014; Davis 1997; Escobar-Lemmon and Taylor-Robinson 2005; Krook and O'Brien 2012; Reynolds 1999; Siaroff 2000; Whitford, Wilkins, and Ball 2007). These studies develop and test a range of hypotheses relating to the demographic, socioeconomic, political cultural, or political institutional factors at state or system level deemed to shape women's access to political executive office. The conclusions primarily emphasize relatively general correlations between women's ministerial representation and a nation's familiarity with women in positions of power (Reynolds 1999), the prevalence of ""egalitarian societies"" and ""leftist values"" (Siaroff 2000), or international pressure and regional contagion (Escobar-Lemmon and Taylor-Robinson 2005). Studies that address the importance of political institutional factors affecting the supply and demand of female government ministers highlight the different procedures for appointing ministers in presidential versus parliamentary democracies (Reynolds 1999; Whitford, Wilkins, and Ball 2007) or the generalist versus specialist recruitment traditions of ministerial recruitment in parliamentary democracies (Claveria 2014; Davis 1997; Siaroff 2000).

Intersectional Puzzles: Understanding Inclusion and Equality in Political Recruitment,"Celis, Karen; Erzeel, Silvia; Mügge, Liza","Feminist scholars have developed a solid research agenda on gender equality in politics. This scholarship is built on the conviction that equitable representation of men and women is fundamental to the functioning of representative democracies (Mansbridge 1999; Norris and Lovenduski 1995). In order to comply with the intersectional research paradigm, gender and politics scholars have increasingly focused on other discriminatory mechanisms and how these relate to gender. Marginalized or privileged positions based on gender, ethnicity, race, class, or age are conceived not as ""swinging free"" from each other, but as interacting (Hancock 2007). Consequently, a group can be privileged in one context but disadvantaged in another depending on historical structures and contexts. Such an intersectional approach raises new questions about the meaning of political equality (Mügge 2013; Mügge and De Jong 2013). For instance, to what extent is women's sheer numerical presence an indicator for political equality if that presence is a marker of inclusion as well as exclusion? This contribution focuses on political recruitment and the question of whether inclusion fosters equality. Drawing on our ongoing research on Belgium and the Netherlands, we argue that an intersectional analysis of recruitment is indispensable to capture the nature of inclusion and exclusion and therefore to the understanding of political equality.",2015,,Politics & Gender,11,4,765-770,1749295243,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X15000501,,#515,Celis 2015,"",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate what types of microaggressions inform several nonwhite teachers that they cannot perform aesthetic labour in private language schools in Toronto, Canada. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilizes a critical race methodology in which several nonwhite teachers told stories of racial microaggressions. Findings – The teachers were told that they lacked the right aesthetic through microaggressions involving employers being confused about their names, questioning their language backgrounds, and citing customer preferences.

Other studies must investigate how intersecting identity markers affect teachers’ employment prospects.

Then, using the case of teaching hospitals, the paper empirically demonstrates how individuals and organizations experience and deal with inclusion disconnects across the boundaries of organization and community. Design/methodology/approach – A multi-method qualitative study was conducted in hospitals located in the same city. Focus groups were conducted with 11 medical trainees from underrepresented backgrounds and semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten leaders involved with diversity efforts at two hospitals. Data analysis followed an iterative approach built from Miles and Huberman (1994).

A theory of planned behavior perspective on hiring Malaysians with disabilities,"Ang, Magdalene CH; Ramayah, T; Amin, Hanudin","Purpose – The high unemployment rates among persons with disabilities (PWDs) is nothing new. Many people fail to recognize that the disabled population is a significant but largely untapped source of human resources. Prejudices and misconceptions about PWDs’ ability to perform and compete in the open market are likely to be the cause. While the topic of PWDs’ employment has been substantially studied, no known research has explored the applicability of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in the context of hiring PWDs. In addressing the research gap, this paper details a preliminary study which examined the influence of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on managerial intention to hire Malaysians with disabilities. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained via a survey on 200 employers representing private organizations in East Malaysia. To examine the hypothesized linkages within the TPB framework, the authors conducted PLS analysis. The authors also examined the measurement model using PLS. Findings – The results of the PLS analysis indicated that subjective norm and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted managerial intention to hire Malaysians with disabilities. Contrary to expectations, the data did not provide support for the influence of attitude toward hiring decisions for PWDs. Research limitations/implications – Given the research approach, generalizing the findings must be done with caution. Longitudinal studies may provide further support to the results. Future studies can extend the TPB framework by examining other variables such as attributes of Malaysians with disabilities or those of hiring managers. Hiring behavior can also be included in the model to confirm if behavioral intention of hiring will evidently result in actual hiring of Malaysians with disabilities. Practical implications – This study found the TPB to have a predictive power in the area of hiring PWDs. Results obtained can serve as a basis for future works in this area. The study also offers implications for the development of public and organizational policies that can better promote and manage the careers of Malaysians with disabilities. Social implications – An enhanced knowledge about the factors which can influence managerial intention to hire Malaysians with disabilities will help increase the employment of Malaysians with disabilities.

Are You Man Enough to be a Nurse? The Impact of Ambivalent Sexism and Role Congruity on Perceptions of Men and Women in Nursing Advertisements,"Clow, Kimberley A; Ricciardelli, Rosemary; Bartfay, Wally J","Framed by role congruity and ambivalent sexism, the current study is designed to investigate perceptions of male and female nurses. Specifically, 167 Canadian undergraduates from Southern Ontario viewed a potential nursing recruitment advertisement (female nurse, male nurse, or masculinity emphasized male nurse), reported their perceptions of the nurse in the advertisement, and rated the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women. MANOVAs revealed that participants viewed the male nurses more negatively (less competent and more deviant) in the masculinity emphasized condition than the male nurse condition, which is consistent with role congruity theory. Correlations further revealed that men in the male nurse condition and women in the masculinity emphasized condition who were higher in hostile sexism were more likely to rate the depicted male nurse as deviant than their lower scoring peers. Female participants rated nursing as a more appropriate career for men than did male participants, suggesting that resistance toward male nurses may stem primarily from other men. The ambivalent sexism scores of men and women related differently in each condition to ratings of the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women, suggesting a complex relationship between sexism and acceptance of male nurses. The findings imply that attempts to challenge current stereotypes by emphasizing the masculinity of men in female dominated careers may instead lead to perceptions of greater role incongruity—and more negative perceptions of men in these careers.

Gender wage gaps in Australian workplaces: are policy responses working?,"Chang, Joshua; Connell, Julia; Burgess, John; Travaglione, Antonio","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to focus on the implications of the gender wage gap in Australia, before considering policy responses and their effectiveness at both the government and workplace levels. Design/methodology/approach – The method concerns an extensive literature review and an examination of secondary data and reports relating to workplace gender equality and data. Findings – While the gender wage gap in most OECD countries has decreased over time, in Australia the gap has increased, with the largest contributory factor identified as gender discrimination. Consequently it is proposed that current policy responses supporting women in the workplace appear to be ineffective in closing gender wage gaps. Research limitations/implications – Further research is recommended to identify the impact of gender equality policies on hiring decisions and whether such decisions include an unwillingness to hire or promote women. As findings were based on secondary data, it is recommended that future research include workplace surveys and case studies. Practical implications – It is suggested that articles such as this one can assist in guiding public policy and workplace decisions on gender wage equality issues, in addition to providing human resource leaders with the information to make better decisions relating to gender equality. Originality/value – This paper suggests that current policy responses may not only be ineffective in closing the gender wage gap, but may even exacerbate it as employers may avoid hiring women or continue to pay them less than men, due to costs incurred when attempting to meet policy directives.",2014,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",33,8,764-775,2084925741,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-10-2013-0080,,#530,Chang 2014,"",""

The short form, defined as less than 20 hours per week, is associated with the youngest and oldest age groups, slight disability, a higher number of children, lower skill levels, and employment in community, social and personal services. Although the incidence of part-time employment varies considerably across countries, long part-time employment is generally more widespread than short part-time employment, albeit with matching cross-country variations in the incidence of the two types.

Diversity and inclusion in an emerging market context,Preeya Daya,"Purpose - The extreme demographic misrepresentation of organisations is a key business and societal issue in South Africa (SA). The purpose of this paper is to provide organisations that are committed to the creation of a diverse and inclusive environment with key considerations that need to be managed in order to create more diverse drive transformation. Design/methodology/approach - This research uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques to gain an understanding of the elements that need to be managed to enhance perception of inclusion in the SA workplace. Findings - The study finds that key inclusion elements that need to be transformed at an organisational level include ""senior leadership"", ""organisation climate"", ""organisational belonging"", ""communication"" and ""transparent recruitment, promotion and development"". At an interpersonal level or relational level, inclusion components include respect and acceptance, the ""line manager/subordinate relationship"" (which includes the subordinates experience of dignity, trust and recognition), ""engagement"" which includes decision-making authority and access to information, and finally the ""individual's relationship with the organisation's vision and values"". Finally, at an individual level, factors which influenced inclusion, and therefore required attention in recruitment or management were ""personality"", ""locus of control"", self-confidence which includes self-esteem and ""power"". Research limitations/implications - While this research facilitated ""deep"" insight into the diversity and inclusion components, this study could have been enriched through exploring diversity and inclusion in other organisational contexts. Second, while the InclusionIndex(TM) survey provided a useful base measure of inclusion for this research, the use of a survey as the primary research tool might have been leading to the respondents. Third, because the InclusionIndex(TM) survey was used as the exploratory tool, and was the respondents' first exposure to the diversity and inclusion terminology, the survey became the informal frame of reference for diversity and inclusion, and thus might have influenced the focus group discussion and semi-structured interview responses. Practical implications - Using these diversity and inclusion considerations, leaders of pluralistic and multicultural organisations can focus their attention on developing inclusion areas that are weak and require more consideration. Second, this research aims to establish that inclusion extends beyond recruitment of diverse individuals to a process driven at organisational, interpersonal and individual levels.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses new national workforce data, the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care (NMDS-SC), n=357,869. The paper employs descriptive statistical analysis and a set of logistic regression models. Findings - The results indicate that labour participation of British black and minority ethnic (BME) groups in long-term care work is much lower than previously believed. There are variations in nature of work and possibly job security by ethnicity. Research limitations/implications - While the national sample is large, the data were not purposively collected to examine differentials in reasons to work in the care sector by different ethnicity. Practical implications - The analysis highlights the potential to actively promote social care work among British BME groups to meet workforce shortages, especially at a time where immigration policies are restricting the recruitment of non-European Economic Area nationals.

When is positive action not positive action? Exploring the conceptual meaning and implications of the tie-break criterion in the UK Equality Act 2010,"Johns, Nick; MacBride-Stewart, Sara; Powell, Martin; Green, Alison","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the claim that the tie-break criterion introduced under the Equality Act 2010 is not really positive action as is claimed by its government sponsors. It evaluates this claim by locating the tie-break into equal opportunities theory, taking into account merit considerations, and reviews its potential implications. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual discussion of the tie-break. Findings - The paper concludes that the tie-break is not positive action, nor is it positive discrimination. It employs the framework established by Forbes (1991) and attempts to locate it in theoretical discussions of the need to refine merit to take identity characteristics into account. While it could serve to make a more sophisticated approach to merit possible it fails to achieve its implicit potential in this regard. Research limitations/implications - The paper is conceptual and will benefit from empirical support in the future. Practical implications - Practically, the tie-break promises to add some greater clarity to the muddled understanding of equal opportunities and diversity that underpins much policy and legislation. As a result it will arguably prove hard to implement and will carry other associated problems. Social implications - Socially, the tie-break, mis-represented as it currently is, promises to create greater uncertainty around the nature and purposes of equality of opportunity. Consequently, it could exacerbate tensions and hostilities and promote significant resistance to ""equality"" measures. Originality/value - This paper is an original conceptual piece that will shine a light on an important legal innovation.

Recruiting business PhDs: US minority motives and concerns,"Forray, Jeanie M; Goodnight, Janelle E","Purpose - While institutional efforts have shown modest results, AACSB statistics suggest that current practices are insufficient to increase more substantively the representation of minorities among doctorally qualified business school faculty. The purpose of this paper is to explore antecedents to the faculty representation issue - that is, the motives, concerns, and resources of US minority individuals with respect to business doctoral program entry - as a basis for improving minority faculty representation outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - A small sample of doctoral program directors were interviewed to ascertain their perspective on recruitment, design and delivery of PhD programs in business and from which a survey instrument was developed. A sample of 292 US minority respondents surveyed indicated their top reasons for and concerns about pursuing a doctorate, program selection and rejection criteria, sources of information and financing, and, for those in the decision-making stage, reasons for waiting to apply to a program. The paper compares responses of those who graduated from or are currently enrolled in a doctoral program in business with those who decided not to enroll. The paper also explores factors most salient to individuals currently contemplating enrolling but who have not yet decided to do so. Findings - Results suggest that mentorship of promising undergraduate and master's students by business faculty and current doctoral students is critical to US minority enrollments in doctoral programs; however, a school's physical location, required time and energy, and financial considerations also play a role in the decision-making process. The role of international students in diversity efforts by doctoral programs is also salient. Originality/value - Previous studies in multiple disciplines note the under-representation of US minority faculty in academe. In business education, suggestions for overcoming this gap have focussed on recruitment, mentoring, and/or networks and support groups but little is known about antecedents to entry (motives, concerns, and resources of US minority individuals) with respect to business doctoral programs.",2014,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",33,1,2-41,1467825109,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-10-2012-0099,,#537,Forray 2014,"",""
Moral commitment to gender equality increases (mis)perceptions of gender bias in hiring,"Xiao, HL; Marie, A; Strickland, B","Exploring what modulates people's trust in evidence of hiring discrimination is crucial to the deployment of corrective policies. Here, we explore one powerful source of variation in such judgments: moral commitment to gender equality (MCGE), that is, perceptions of the issue as a moral imperative and as identity-defining. Across seven experiments (N = 3579), we examined folk evaluations of scientific reports of hiring discrimination in academia. Participants who were more morally committed to gender equality were more likely to trust rigorous, experimental evidence of gender discrimination against women. This association between moral commitment and research evaluations was not reducible to prior beliefs, and largely explained a sex difference in people's evaluations on the issue. On a darker note, however, MCGE was associated with increased chances of fallaciously inferring discrimination against women from contradictory evidence. Overall, our results suggest that moral convictions amplify people's myside bias, bringing about both benefits and costs in the public consumption of science.",2024,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,54,6,1211-1227,WOS:001230482500001,10.1002/ejsp.3071,,#538,Xiao 2024,"",""
Gender discrimination in China: Experimental evidence from the job market for college graduates,"Zhang, J; Jin, SQ; Li, T; Wang, HG","This paper examines employment-related gender discrimination during the initial stages of a hiring process. It specifically focuses on recent college graduates in China. By examining firms' responses to fictitious resumes with randomly generated information on gender and other key attributes of applicants (e.g., school reputation, student's academic achievement, and leadership experiences), this study is able to separate the effect of gender on a student's potential for getting an on-site interview from the confounding effects of other factors. The findings reveal that, with all other factors remaining constant, female applicants, on average, are less likely to be invited by hiring firms to on-site interviews as compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, gender discrimination in computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations appears to be driving the results of this study. The qualitative evidence based on interviews with firm recruiters suggests that the findings of this study are generally consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature.

In particular, we first conduct a literature review to assess how the problem of gender bias in academia has been addressed so far. Next, we describe a process to collect and preprocess the INF and SE data needed to analyse gender bias in Italian academic promotions.

"Gender, Productivity, and Prestige in Computer Science Faculty Hiring Networks","ACM; Way, SF; Larremore, DB; Clauset, A","Women are dramatically underrepresented in computer science at all levels in academia and account for just 15% of tenure-track faculty. Understanding the causes of this gender imbalance would inform both policies intended to rectify it and employment decisions by departments and individuals. Progress in this direction, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature of faculty hiring and the non-independence of hires. Using comprehensive data on both hiring outcomes and scholarly productivity for 2659 tenure-track faculty across 205 Ph.D.-granting departments in North America, we investigate the multidimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty hiring through a network model of the hiring process. Overall, we find that hiring outcomes are most directly affected by (i) the relative prestige between hiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the candidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender did not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do exist, e.g., in scholarly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in career movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects of gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender's covariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments recruit female faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit similar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the subtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new insights to the underrepresentation of women in computer science.",2016,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW'16),,,1169-1179,WOS:000461467400100,,,#548,ACM 2016,"",""

The results show that, despite the underrepresentation of women in all fields, the female candidates were viewed as both more competent and more hireable compared to their male counterparts.

The Glaring Gender Bias in the Operating Room: A Qualitative Study of Factors Influencing Career Selection for First-Year Medical Students,"Sorouri, K; Khan, S; Bowden, S; Searle, S; Carr, L; Simpson, JS","OBJECTIVE: Despite greater female than male-identifying Canadian medical graduates, women continued to be underrepresented in surgical specialties. The aim of this study was to explore the role of lifestyle challenges and gender-specific considerations in career selection for first-year medical students following early exposure to surgery through an immersive surgical program. DESIGN: A single institution, qualitative study consisting of structured focus groups before and after completion of a 2 week surgical program was used to explore medical student perceptions of surgery. The program consisted of shadowing, surgeon-led talks, and surgical skills workshops in all direct-entry surgical specialties within the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto. Six entry and exit interviews were conducted by 2 authors. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for thematic analysis. SETTING: Teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Toronto, Canada PARTICIPANTS: Thirty first-year medical students with interest in surgery participated in the program and the focus groups. RESULTS: Four prominent themes emerged: gender imbalances in the work environment, the importance of female mentors, gender-specific challenges of parenting, and the importance of flexible work hours for both male and female students. Greater exposure to female surgeons improved the outlook of medical students on work-life balance. Medical students are concerned with the challenges of pregnancy in a surgical profession. Both male and female students consider parenting, supportive partners, and flexibility of work hours in their career selection. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the prevalence of gender bias in surgical specialties, raising gender-specific challenges that impact career selection for first-year medical students. In an effort to address these perceptions, this study supports efforts to implement formalized mentorship programs for women in surgery early in medical education. Furthermore, concerns surrounding childbearing further support the need for well-established parental leave policies in the Canadian postgraduate medical education system. (J Surg Ed 78:1516-1523.

Female Medical Student Retention in Neurosurgery: A Multifaceted Approach,"Dixon, A; Silva, NA; Sotayo, A; Mazzola, CA","BACKGROUND: Since 2011, more women than men have graduated from medical school, yet there remains a paucity of female physicians in surgical specialties. After the 2018 Neurosurgery Match, only 17.5% of neurosurgery residents are women. Previous literature documented gender inequality, poor medical school exposure, and lack of female mentorship as reasons for this disparity. We sought to further explore factors that deter female medical students from pursuing neurosurgery.METHODS: A comprehensive survey was created and distributed to the 2017-2018 Rutgers New Jersey Medical School student body, requesting anonymous input from female medical students.RESULTS: Of 104 female respondents, 26.9% had considered neurosurgery as a career and felt dissuaded because of their gender. Of respondents, 88% did not have a senior female medical student pursuing neurosurgery or a female neurosurgical resident as a mentor. More than half of respondents disagreed that they would be dissuaded from a field if they did not have a female mentor. The 88.46% of women who felt that there was a glass ceiling in medicine were also more likely to feel that they would face inequality and adversity that would inhibit training in a male-dominated field. Women who described themselves as seeking challenging and competitive careers strongly felt that they would benefit from exposure to surgical subspecialties during their preclinical years.CONCLUSIONS: Female medical students remain resilient, ambitious, interested in competitive specialties, and eager to explore surgical subspecialties during preclinical years.

Gender Disparities Within US Army Orthopedic Surgery: A Preliminary Report,"Daniels, CM; Dworak, TC; Anderson, AB; Brelin, AM; Nesti, LJ; McKay, PL; Gwinn, DE","Introduction: Women account for approximately 15% of the active duty US Army, and studies show that women may be at an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury during sport and military training. Nationally, the field of orthopedic surgery comprises 14% women, lagging behind other surgical fields. Demographics for US Military orthopedic surgeons are not readily available. Similarly, demographic data of graduating medical students entering Military Medicine are not reported. We hypothesize that a gender disparity within military orthopedics will be apparent. We will compare the demographic profile of providers to our patients and hypothesize that the two groups are dissimilar. Secondarily, we examine the demographics of military medical students potentially entering orthopedics from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) or the Health Professions Scholarship Program. Methods: A census was formed of all US Army active duty orthopedic surgeons to include staff surgeons and residents, as well as US Army medical student graduates and orthopedic patients. Results: There are 252 Army orthopedic surgeons and trainees; 26 (10.3%) are women and 226 (89.7%) are men. There were no significant demographic differences between residents and staff. Between 2014 and 2017, the 672 members of the USUHS graduating classes included 246 Army graduates. Of those, 62 (25%) were female. Army Health Professions Scholarship Program graduated 1,072 medical students, with women comprising 300 (28%) of the group. No statistical trends were seen over the 4 yr at USUHS or in Health Professions Scholarship Program. In total, 2,993 orthopedic clinic visits during the study period were by Army service members, 23.6% were women. Conclusion: There exists a gender disparity among US Army orthopedic surgeons, similar to that seen in civilian orthopedics. Gender equity is also lacking among medical students who feed into Army graduate medical education programs. The gender profile of our patient population is not reflected by that of providers. Because patients prefer providers of the same gender, this is a limitation to patient satisfaction and access to care for musculoskeletal injuries. Further study is underway to identify perceptions and potential causes of these disparities, including the critical perspective of our patients. In addition to the inherent benefits offered by diversity (e.g., expanding the talent pool and more perspectives for decision-making), ultimately it affords a greater ability to maintain a fit and ready force.",2018,,MILITARY MEDICINE,183,1-2,E162-E166,WOS:000425881800023,10.1093/milmed/usx061,,#560,Daniels 2018,"",""
Analysis of the retention of women in higher education STEM programs,"Ortiz-Martínez, G; Vázquez-Villegas, P; Ruiz-Cantisani, MI; Delgado-Fabián, M; Conejo-Márquez, DA; Membrillo-Hernández, J","Gender equity and quality education are Sustainable Development Goals that are present when a culture of equity and inclusion is pursued in society, companies, and institutions.

The objective of this study was to find out the causes of permanence in STEM careers of women, as well as the possible causes of career abandonment towards another STEM or non-STEM career. This was done by analyzing historical data for admission to STEM careers and using an instrument (survey) for data collection carried out in a private university in Mexico. Historical data indicates that only 17% of the total population were women choosing a STEM career. A survey was carried out for 3 months to obtain information on the factors that affect the decision to opt for a STEM career or to remain in it. It was found that men and women prefer inspiring Faculty who motivate them to continue their careers. Factors such as the competitive environment and the difficulty of teaching with less empathetic Faculty were negative and decisive aspects of decision-making. School achievement did not influence the dropout rate of women in STEM careers. The factors of choice and desertion of women in STEM careers were determined, and actions of educational innovation such as mentoring and timely monitoring of already enrolled female students, digital platforms for students and Faculty, awareness workshops for Faculty, and talks with successful women in STEM areas were proposed.",2023,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,10,1,,WOS:000948452100001,10.1057/s41599-023-01588-z,,#562,Ortiz-Martínez 2023,"",""

Gender and racial disparities are some major challenges faced by the health system. This article reviews the gender and racial trends among residents of neurosurgery in the United States (US).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the data extracted from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)'s annual Data Resource Books from 2007 to 2019. ACGME cataloged gender as men and women and race/ethnicity was categorized as White/non-Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Island, Hispanic, Black/non-Hispanic, Native American/Alaskan, others, and unknown. Counts, proportions, relative, and absolute percentage changes were calculated to highlight trends in resident appointments over time and across the specialty of neurosurgery.ResultsThe number of female residents increased steadily from 10.6% in 2007 to 19.3% in 2019; with an absolute increase of 8.74%, a relative increase of 63.9%, and a simultaneous decrease in male residents. When averaged across the nine-year study period, 51% of the study sample was White (non-Hispanic), followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders at 15.2%. The representation of Hispanics was 4.3%, Black/African Americans were 4.5%, Native Americans/Alaskans were 0.2%, and others were 8% of the total study population.ConclusionOur study concludes that gender and racial disparity persist within the neurosurgery residency training programs in the US.

"Do Low-Openness, Low-Transparency Procedures in Academic Hiring Disadvantage Women?","Moratti, S","Research has shown that low openness and low transparency in the process of recruitment of new (associate) professors put women at a systematic disadvantage. Examples include professorships awarded by direct invitation (as opposed to job calls); contexts where nominally open job calls routinely get only one applicant; and procedural rules that allow the filtering out of qualified applicants without sharing the grounds of the decision with the candidates. We investigated one decade (2007-2017) of hiring of new (associate) professors in one Faculty at the largest university in Norway, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (n = 79). The Faculty is a highly gender-equal setting, in that the share of women among associate professors has been >40% for over a decade. We found (1) a high share (about 40%) of women among applicants, maintained among winners; (2) a very sporadic use of direct invitations (two in a decade) and no sign that their use advantages men; (3) no nominally 'open' job calls with only one applicant; (4) no disadvantage for women when the pool of applicants is small; (5) no systematic filtering out of women when low-transparency internal formal preselection procedures are used because of organizational contingencies (e.g., a high number of applicants). We found an overall high degree of openness in the selection procedure when compared to other Scandinavian and Western European studies. Contrary to our expectations (based on the relevant literature), we found no link between low openness in the selection process and gender inequality in the outcome. The latter finding must be interpreted in context. We conclude that the overall good gender balance locally is an antidote to the potential biasing effect of low-openness and low-transparency procedures, so long as such procedures are used only exceptionally, and their use is clearly tied with organizational contingencies. At the same time, we found no indication that low-openness and low-transparency procedures systematically advantage women.",2020,,SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL,9,6,,WOS:000683702200001,10.3390/socsci9060089,,#569,Moratti 2020,"",""

"Perception (of) and Willingness to Choose a Neurosurgery Career Among Final-Year Medical Students in Ibadan, Nigeria","Balogun, JA; Adebayo, AM","BACKGROUND: The deficit in access to neurosurgical care worldwide remains a challenge, particularly in the developing economies such as Nigeria, where the neurosurgeon density is low. The concern that arguably subsists in sub-Saharan Africa is the decline in the number of recruited candidates into surgical specialty training programs, including neurosurgery, despite increasing burden of surgical cases. This study assessed the perception and willingness of medical undergraduates regarding neurosurgery career and determined the factors influencing their choice. This understanding will be critical to advancing ways of motivating them toward a neurosurgery career.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 256 consenting final-year medical students of the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.

Army Combat Fitness Test Relationships to Tactical Foot March Performance in Reserve Officers' Training Corps Cadets,"Withrow, KL; Rubin, DA; Dawes, JJ; Orr, RM; Lynn, SK; Lockie, RG","Simple Summary This study analyzed the relationships between the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT; deadlift, standing power throw, hand release push-up, sprint-drag-carry, leg tuck/plank, 2-mile run) and a 6.44-km tactical foot march (TFM) in Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets. Data from 29 cadets were analyzed. Cadets carried a 15.88-kg rucksack, fighting load carrier, 3-L hydration pack, and replica M4 carbine during the TFM. Partial correlations controlling for sex determined ACFT and TFM relationships. ACFT total score, leg tuck, 2-mile run, and sprint-drag-carry were associated with the TFM. Aerobic and anaerobic capacity, and upper body/trunk strength emerged as fitness components related to cadet TFM performance. The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT), consisting of deadlift, standing power throw, hand release push-up, sprint-drag-carry, leg tuck or plank, and 2-mile run, is the United States Army's new fitness test. The ACFT is designed to measure multiple fitness components required to perform combat tasks. One critical task is the tactical foot march (TFM), where soldiers cover long distances while carrying loads comprised of mission-essential equipment. As the ACFT is meant to predict soldier task performance, determining the relationships between the ACFT and the TFM is important. Data from 29 cadets (male = 20, female = 9) from one university Reserve Officers' Training Corps program were analyzed. The ACFT was recorded in raw and scaled scores. The TFM was performed over 6.44 km, with time recorded. Cadets carried a 15.88-kg rucksack, fighting load carrier, 3-L hydration pack, and replica M4 carbine. Independent samples t-tests evaluated ACFT and TFM between-sex differences. Partial correlations, controlling for sex, determined ACFT event and TFM relationships.

A hierarchical clustering approach for examining the relationship between pelvis-proximal femur geometry and bone stress injury in runners,"Martin, JA; Heiderscheit, BC","Bone stress injury (BSI) risk in runners is multifactorial and not well understood. Unsupervised machine learning approaches can potentially elucidate risk factors for BSI by identifying groups of similar runners within a population which differ in BSI incidence. Here, a hierarchical clustering approach is used to identify groups of collegiate cross country runners based on 2-dimensional frontal plane pelvis and proximal femur geometry, which was extracted from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and dimensionally reduced by principal component analysis. Seven distinct groups were identified using the cluster tree, with the initial split being highly related to female-male differences. Visual inspection revealed clear differences between groups in pelvis and proximal femur geometry, and groups were found to differ in lower body BSI incidence during the subsequent academic year (Rand index = 0.53; adjusted Rand index = 0.07). Linear models showed between-cluster differences in visually identified geometric measures. Geometric measures were aggregated into a pelvis shape factor based on trends with BSI incidence, and the resulting shape factor was significantly different between clusters (p < 0.001). Lower shape factor values, corresponding with lower pelvis height and ischial span, and greater iliac span and trochanteric span, appeared to be related to increased BSI incidence. This trend was dominated by the effect observed across clusters of male runners, indicating that geometric effects may be more relevant to BSI risk in males, or that other factors masked the relationship in females. More broadly, this work outlines a methodological approach for distilling complex geometric differences into simple metrics that relate to injury risk.",2023,,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,160,,,WOS:001085081900001,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111782,,#577,Martin 2023,"",""

Unpacking (un)conscious social class bias in faculty hiring processes in Chile: PhD prestige granting university and network,"Chiappa, R","Social class of origin is apparently an imperceptible attribute among doctorate holders seeking academic jobs. Yet, recent studies in different countries reveal that social class of origin may still be influencing the chances of PhD holders from low social class being hired at prestigious universities. Drawing from the theory of social and cultural reproduction, normative 'fair' academic hirings frameworks, and qualitative evidence collected in Chile, this research identifies the mechanisms that trigger (un)conscious social class bias in the stages of recruitment and selection of candidates in seven academic departments in economics and industrial engineering (46 interviews).

What professors do in peer review: Interrogating assessment practices in the recruitment of professors in Sweden,"Mählck, P; Li Kusterer, H; Montgomery, H","Sweden is known for its political will to gender equality. Sweden is also a country with a strong tradition of transparency in university recruitments. In this article, the assessment practices in the appointment of full professors in one Swedish university are investigated from an intersectional and postcolonial perspective on gender and place/space. Using a multimethod approach to investigate written evaluations of applicants, recruitment group meeting minutes and interviews with reviewers, the results show that there is great variation in how evaluation criteria are applied and filled with meaning. Moreover, in more than half of the appointment decisions the reviewers disagreed. The interview results show a structural bias operating towards researchers applying from non-Western university contexts.

Examining the equity and diversity characteristics of academic general surgeons hired in Canada,"Gawad, N; Purich, K; Verhoeff, K; Anderson, B","Background:Job competition and underemployment among surgeons emphasize the importance of equitable hiring practices. The purpose of this study was to describe some of the demographic characteristics of academic general surgeons and to evaluate the gender and visible minority (VM) status of those recently hired.Methods:Demographic information about academic general surgeons across Canada including gender, VM status, practice location and graduate degree status was collected. Location of residency was collected for recently hired general surgeons (hired between 2013 and 2020). Descriptive statistics were performed on the demographic characteristics at each institution. Pearson correlation coefficients and hypothesis testing were used to determine the correlation between various metrics and gender and VM status.Results:A total of 393 general surgeons from 30 academic hospitals affiliated with 14 universities were included. The percentage of female general surgeons ranged from 0% to 47.4% and the percentage of VM general surgeons ranged from 0% to 66.7% at the hospitals. This heterogeneity did not correlate with city population (gender: r = 0.06, p = 0.77; VM: r = 0.04, p = 0.83). The percentage of VM general surgeons at each hospital did not correlate with the percentage of VM population in the city (r = 0.13, p = 0.49). Only 34 of 120 recently hired academic general surgeons (28.3%) did not have a graduate degree. The percentage of recently hired academic general surgeons who did not have a graduate degree was approximately 1.5 times higher among male hirees than female hirees. With respect to academic promotion, the percentage of female full professors ranged from 0% to 40.0% and did not correlate with the percentage of female general surgeons at each institution (r = 0.11, p = 0.70). The percentage of VM full professors ranged from 0% to 44.4% and was moderately correlated with the percentage of VM surgeons at each institution (r = 0.40, p = 0.16).Conclusion:The academic general surgery workforce appears to be somewhat diverse. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in diversity between hospitals, leaving room for improvement. We must be willing to examine our hiring processes and be transparent about them to build an equitable surgical workforce.Contexte:Les processus d'acces aux postes et le sous-emploi en chirurgie rappellent l'importance d'adopter des pratiques d'embauche equitables.

The goal of this manuscript is to introduce some of the most commonly misunderstood areas of bias, and ways to adjust hiring and promotion practices; and to focus on innovative ways to quantify scientific outputs through metrics other than journal impact factors and paper citation numbers. These alternative metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly reliable predictors of impact for a scientific community that is asked to engage more frequently and more effectively with the public. Additionally, we address discipline-specific concerns around metrics used for hiring and promotion in biosecurity and biosafety, taxonomy, and researchers in government and regulatory roles.

Implementing a mixed methods approach, we aim to highlight the influence of heuristics, stereotyping, and signaling in applicant assessments. We interviewed 45 STEM professors. They answered qualitative open-ended interview questions, and evaluated hypothetical applicant profiles, qualitatively and quantitatively. The applicant profiles enabled a conjoint experiment with different applicant attributes varied across the profiles (i.e., publications, willingness to cooperate, network recommendation, and applicant gender), the interviewees indicating scores of selection recommendation while thinking aloud. Our findings reveal gendered arguments, i.e., questioning women potentially fueled by a perception of women's exceptional status and perceived self-questioning of women.

Since differences in educational routes to the medical degree likely affect career choice dynamics, this study focuses on medical career decision-making in educational systems with a Western European curriculum structure.Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline, Embase) was conducted from January 2008 to November 2014. A panel of seven independent reviewers performed the data extraction, quality assessment and data synthesis using the Bland-Meurer model of medical specialty choice as a reference.Results: Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Factors associated with specialty preference or career choice can be classified in five main categories: (1) medical school characteristics (e.g., curriculum structure), (2) student characteristics (e.g., age, personality), (3) student values (e.g., personal preference), (4) career needs to be satisfied (e.g., expected income, status, and work-life balance), and (5) perception of specialty characteristics (e.g., extracurricular or curricular experiences). Especially career needs and perceptions of specialty characteristics are often associated with medical career decision-making.Conclusion: Our results support that medical career decisions are formed by a matching of perceptions of specialty characteristics with personal needs.

A further problem facing the country is the shortage of woman engineers. Further to encouraging and supporting women entering the field of engineering, a South African university established the Women in Engineering Leadership Association (WELA) in 2011. In 2013, WELA embarked on a longitudinal study to establish the impact of the association on WELA members, and to determine the differences in self-efficacy between male and woman engineering students. The research instrument used for the purpose of the study was an adapted version of the Longitudinal Assessment of Engineering Self-Efficacy as developed by Marra and Bogue from the Assessing Women in Engineering (AWE) project. The findings presented in this article are the results of the first round of questionnaires, which highlighted findings relating to student recruitment, development, retention and success. The results of the first round of the study identified that co-curricular interventions were important to prepare students for the world of work, that international partnerships played a potentially powerful role in developing students, that role models were important especially to female engineering students and that technology was an important tool to recruit students. The aim of this article is to assist engineering faculties to understand possible gender differences and self-efficacy issues that could influence course selection, success, development and retention rates of male and woman engineering students. The study also envisions that other universities concerned with student development, success and retention would be able to duplicate some of the findings described.",2015,,JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES,13,1,36-53,WOS:000420044500003,,,#594,Lourens 2015,"",""
Predictive Modeling of US Transportation Workforce Diversity Trends: A Study of Human Capital Recruitment and Retention in Complex Environments,"Kermanshachi, S; Sadatsafavi, H","Successful delivery of transportation projects requires extensive level of effort spent by departments of transportation skilled employees. Although these human resources are very valuable assets for transportation projects, most state agencies face numerous challenges in recruitment and retention of motivated and diverse employees. Earlier studies concluded that recent college graduates are less attracted to be hired by state agencies as the salary range would be less competitive compared to the same positions in private companies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate and assess the recruitment and retention trends of transportation workforce across different U.S. regions. For this reason, this research project utilized U.S. transportation workforce demographic information which has been nationally collected and published. The used database includes several demographical aspects of transportation workforce including: region, gender, age, disability status, ethnicity/race, years of experience, and supervisory role. In this study, the association of transportation workforce age with the transportation organization responsibilities across various regions were studied and analyzed. Furthermore, gender-based distribution of transportation workforce controlling for other variables was investigated and presented. It was concluded that the proportion of male to female employees in engineering positions is only associated with their race/ethnicity and year of service. It was also found that the gender disparity in engineering positions is higher in the White group than the African/American group controlling for region, year of service, disability status, and role (supervisory versus nonsupervisory).

Difficulty of recruiting reviewers predicts review scores and editorial decisions at six journals of ecology and evolution,"Fox, CW","Journal peer review relies on the willingness of researchers to volunteer their time to review manuscripts. However, editors often have difficulty recruiting reviewers, and this difficulty can vary quite substantially among manuscripts. This study examines whether the difficulty recruiting reviewers influences outcomes of the peer review process at six journals of ecology and evolution. The difficulty editors had recruiting reviewers varied substantially among papers, with editors successfully recruiting the first two people invited just 22% of the time, and being declined by two or more invitees for more than half (56%) of reviewed papers. Papers for which editors had more difficulty recruiting reviewers were more likely to be declined at all six journals, with an increase in the odds of acceptance ranging from a low of 3.5 +/- 1.2% to a high of 17.3 +/- 2.0% for each 10% increase in the proportion of reviewers agreeing to review. Papers for which editors had more difficulty recruiting reviewers were also reviewed less positively at all six journals, and this influence on review scores explained most but not all of the influence of recruitment difficulty on outcomes. Reviewers invited close together in sequence (without many declined invitations between them) were more consistent in the scores they submit than were reviewers invited more greatly separated in sequence, suggesting that editors recruit different kinds of reviewers early versus late in the reviewer invitation sequence. However, the scores submitted by later-recruited reviewers were not less predictive of the editor's decision than were scores of early-recruited reviewers. The influence of reviewer recruitment difficulty on decisions, although of small effect, should be considered among the diversity of variables that influence outcomes of the editorial and peer review process at academic journals.",2017,,SCIENTOMETRICS,113,1,465-477,WOS:000412527000023,10.1007/s11192-017-2489-5,,#597,Fox 2017,"",""

The aim of this three-step survey is to study the motivational factors for students and trainees in internal medicine to choose for rheumatology as a future career option and the idea among experienced rheumatologists about the needs for changes in the training program. An online survey was distributed among students in medical training (in the final 3 years) and trainees in internal medicine from the Ghent University and University Hospital. Questions concerned the level of clinical exposure to rheumatology and the motivation about becoming rheumatologist. Next, experienced rheumatologists were asked about the needs to change the current training. Descriptive data are shown and chi-squared tests were calculated to assess differences between groups (based on gender and exposure). Logistic regression was performed to study associations between demographic variables and choosing rheumatology as career. Only a minority of students (17%) and about half of trainees (45%) were ever exposed to rheumatology. Only 11% of students and 17% of trainees considered becoming rheumatologist. There was no difference in choice based on gender but previous exposure seemed to play an important role, and especially during the pre-specialty years. Univariate logistic regression identified the year of training and exposure as predictors for choosing rheumatology. Multivariate analysis only retained exposure as significantly associated (odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.88 (1.51-12.58)).

The influence of demographic factors on perceptions of neurosurgery of interns and senior medical students in Saudi Arabia was also investigated. Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of medical students (clinical years) and interns studying in different colleges of medicine in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1014 responses were included in this study (518 males and 496 females). The questionnaire comprised of two parts: the first part carried general descriptive questions, while the second part had 24-item Likert scale-based questions. Results: Around 40% of medical students and 26% of interns agreed or strongly agreed to the statement 'I would consider a career in neurosurgery. Around 70% of both interns and students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement 'Huge prestige is attached to neurosurgery'. The responses to the statement 'Neurosurgery is a male specialty' was significantly different between genders, as 36.5% of the male respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement while just 12.5% of the females responded likewise (p = 0.000).

For registry-derived referrals, physicians screened a list of patients with BMI >= 25 and approved patients for participation to receive a personalized referral letter via mail.Results: Out of a potential 991 referrals, 573 (57.8%) referrals were made over 16 weeks, and 98 (9.9%) patients were enrolled in the program (58/98, 59.2% female). Differences based on letter (485/991, 48.9%) versus POC (506/991, 51.1%) referrals were identified for completion (100% vs 7%; P<.001) and for proportion screened (36% vs 12%; P<.001) but not for proportion enrolled (12% vs 8%; P=.10). Patients receiving ATF were more likely to be screened (47% vs 7%; P<.001) and enrolled (15% vs 7%; P<.001) than those not receiving ATF. On the basis of the number of referrals made in each condition, we found variations in the proportion and number of enrollees (POC with ATF: 27/190, 50%; POC no ATF: 14/316, 41%; letter ATF: 30/199; 15.1%; letter no ATF: 27/286, 9.4%). Across all conditions, participants were representative of the racial and ethnic characteristics of the region (60% female, P=.15; 94% White individuals, P=.60; 94% non-Hispanic, P=.19). Recruitment costs totaled US $6192, and the overall recruitment cost per enrolled participant was US $63. Cost per enrolled participant ranged from POC with ATF (US $47), registry-derived letter without ATF (US $52), and POC without ATF (US $56) to registry-derived letter with ATF (US $91).Conclusions: Letter referral with ATF appears to be the best option for enrolling a large number of patients in a digitally delivered weight management program; however, POC with ATF and letters without ATF yielded similar numbers at a lower cost. The best referral option is likely dependent on the best fit with clinical resources.",2021,,JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,5,10,,WOS:000853674500020,10.2196/28622,,#605,Porter 2021,"",""
Female Student Participation in Recreational Activities: A Study of Facilities Availability and Its Influencing Factors in Nigerian Northern University,"Agbabiaka, HI; Doguwa, MA; Ukpong, E","Bayero University is located in the northern region of the country, which is a Muslim-dominated society where the level of disparity between the male and female genders is high. Hence, this study examined female student participation in recreational activities. Data were obtained through questionnaire administration on female students. Information obtained from the center of information technology revealed 9,685 registered female students across 11 faculties. A total of 291 respondents were selected for the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings revealed that recreation facilities are abundantly provided in the University, and most students are aware of their existence. The study further revealed that female students participate less in sporting activities except for jogging, walking, listening to music, and reading. The reason why female students participate in recreation includes: Getting exercise (SPI = 4.41), Keep physically fit (SPI = 4.39), Educational/research (SPI = 4.38), Improving physical, and emotional health (SPI = 4.29), Developing skill/ability (SPI = 4.08), Boredom (SPI = 3.99), and Minimize stress (SPI = 3.77).

Limitations in Faculty Advancement for Underrepresented Groups in Academic Otolaryngology,"Kim, SG; Russel, SM; Stack, TJ; Frank-Ito, DO; Farzal, Z; Ebert, CS ; Buckmire, RA; Demason, CE; Shah, RN","Objective: Despite the increasing racial diversity of the United States, representation in academic medicine faculty does not reach concordance with the general population and worsens with higher rank. Few studies have examined this within academic Otolaryngology and surgical subspecialties. This project aims to compare rank equity in academic Otolaryngology on self-reported gender and race/ethnicity between the years 2000 and 2020.Methods: Publicly available data were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges under the ""Data & Reports"" section for the years 2000 and 2020. The report comprised of full-time faculty from all U.S. medical schools. To determine parity between faculty ranks across gender and race/ethnicity, rank equity index (REI) was calculated for associate/assistant, professor/associate, and professor/assistant professor comparisons.Results: The percentage of women faculty in Otolaryngology has increased from 21% in 2000 to 37% in 2020; however, they did not achieve parity at all rank comparisons for both years. On the contrary, men were above parity at all rank comparisons. Improvements in rank equity occurred for Black/African American (Black) and Hispanic Latino/Spanish Origin (Latine) faculty between the years 2000 and 2020; however, when accounting for gender, benefits were concentrated among men.Conclusion: Advancement along the academic ladder is limited for women of all racial groups in academic Otolaryngology. While improved rank equity was seen for Black and Latine faculty, these improvements were largely among men. Future directions should aim to identify barriers to recruitment, retention, and promotion for women and underrepresented in medicine (URiM) academic otolaryngologists and create interventions that diversify Otolaryngology faculty at all ranks.Level of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 2023",2024,,LARYNGOSCOPE,134,4,1625-1632,WOS:001096325300001,10.1002/lary.31110,,#610,Kim 2024,"",""
Neurosurgery in Saudi Arabia: Navigating Through Future Pathways and Students' Perspectives,"Sadah, ZMA; Altalib, AA; Al-Jehani, HM","BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery is a surgical discipline that demands comprehensive knowledge in other specialties. It is regarded as one of the most competitive specialties. However, there is a new trend toward considering life-style friendly specialties. Therefore, this study aims to assess the neurosurgery perception and identify potential factors influencing such attitudes. METHODS: An observational, survey-based study was conducted on medical students at the College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia. An online-based questionnaire was administered to the participants. It consisted of 2 main parts: the first part collected demographic data, while the second part included 20 Likert scale-based questions. Pearson's chi(2) test was utilized, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 305 medical students from various academic years participated in the questionnaire survey, with nearly an equal gender distribution. Remarkably, a significant majority (76.72%) expressed uncertainty or disagreement regarding the adequacy of neurosurgery education during their medical studies. While a substantial portion of participants (69.5%) found neurosurgery intriguing, almost half (47.87%) indicated that they would not pursue it as their future specialty. The consideration of neurosurgery as a career path showed statistically sigificant differences in relation to both gender and academic year (P = 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes how gender and academic year affect choosing neurosurgery as a career but notes limitations like self-reporting bias and a single-institution scope, which may affect generalizability.

"Diversity by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex within the US Psychiatry Physician Workforce","Wyse, R; Hwang, WT; Ahmed, AA; Richards, E; Deville, C","Objective This study assessed the distribution of race, ethnicity, and sex within the US psychiatry physician workforce and trends from 1987 to 2016. Methods The authors used physician workforce data to assess differences in race, ethnicity, and sex among psychiatric practicing physicians, faculty, fellows, residents, residency applicants, and medical graduate cohorts. Binomial tests were used for comparison between individual cohorts and to US population statistics. A simple linear regression model was used to assess trends among psychiatric residents and faculty over years 1987-2016. Results Within psychiatry, historically underrepresented minorities in medicine (URMs) had less representation as residents (16.2%), faculty (8.7%), and practicing physicians (10.4%) compared with the US population (32.6%), Ps < 0.0001. Females were underrepresented as psychiatric practicing physicians (38.5%,P < .0001). There was greater URM representation among residents (16.2%) compared with that of Psychiatry faculty and practicing physicians (Ps < .0001). Racial/ethnic representation did not differ significantly compared with subspecialty fellows; however, the addiction subspecialty contained the least URM and female diversity. Historical trends indicated the proportion of female faculty (0.9%/yr) increased nearly 1.5 times faster than that of female trainees (0.6%/year). Conversely, the proportion of URM residents (0.26%/year) increased over 4 times faster than that of URM faculty (0.06%/year), with black faculty actually decreasing in proportion. Conclusions Female and URM representation within the psychiatry physician workforce is significantly lower than US population demographics; however, trends indicate diminishing underrepresentation.

US Adults' Likelihood to Participate in Dementia Prevention Drug Trials: Results from the National Poll on Healthy Aging,"Cox, CG; Davis, MA; Grill, JD; Roberts, JS","Background Recruitment to dementia prevention clinical trials is challenging, and participants are not representative of US adults at risk. A better understanding of the general public's interest in dementia prevention research participation is needed to inform future recruitment strategies. Objective To examine US adults' characteristics associated with self-reported likelihood to participate in dementia prevention clinical trials. Design We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the October 2018 wave of the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging. Setting The National Poll on Healthy Aging is a nationally representative survey of adults using KnowledgePanel (Ipsos Public Affairs LLC), a probability-based panel of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Participants We analyzed data from 1,028 respondents, ages 50 to 64 years, who completed a web survey module on brain health. Measurements We used logistic regression models to examine associations between sociodemographic and dementia-related factors (e.g., family history) and self-reported likelihood to participate in a dementia prevention clinical trial of a new medicine (""very"" or ""somewhat likely"" vs. ""not likely"" survey responses). Among respondents not likely to participate, we examined frequency of reasons endorsed for this decision, stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Results Of the 1,028 respondents, half were female, 68% Non-Hispanic White, 13% Hispanic, and 12% Non-Hispanic Black. Twelve percent of respondents reported being very likely to participate in a dementia prevention trial, 32% somewhat likely, and 56% not likely. Factors associated with higher likelihood to participate were higher perceived risk of dementia [OR, 2.17 (95% CI, 1.61, 2.93)], a positive family history of dementia [OR, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.27, 2.43)], and having discussed dementia prevention with a doctor [OR, 2.20 (95% CI, 1.10, 4.42)]. There were no differences in likelihood to participate by sociodemographic characteristics. Among 570 respondents not likely to participate, 39% said they did not want to be a guinea pig, 23% thought dementia would not affect them, 22% thought there would be too high a chance for harm, 15% indicated study participation would take too much time, and 5% reported fear of learning information about oneself. There were no differences across age, sex, and racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions In this study, perceived risk of dementia, family history, and discussion of prevention with a doctor were associated with likelihood to participate in a dementia prevention clinical trial, whereas sociodemographic factors including race and ethnicity were not. Findings suggest that recruitment interventions focused on increasing knowledge of dementia risk and prevention trials and involving healthcare providers may be effective tools to improve enrollment rates, regardless of target community.",2023,,JPAD-JOURNAL OF PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE,10,1,34-40,WOS:000870077600001,10.14283/jpad.2022.86,,#613,Cox 2023,"",""
"When, Why, How, Who - Recruitment Lessons from First Year Engineering Students in the Millennial Generation","ASEE; Lehr, JL; Finger, H; Snelling, AC","Today, an increasing number of women enter, remain, and succeed within science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) fields. However, women's participation is still not proportionate. Women earned 18.4% of undergraduate degrees in engineering in 2010 according to the 2013 Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering report published by the NSF, with significant variance by subfield. In 2012, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee affirmed that, ""Women's increased participation in the STEM workforce is essential to alleviating the shortage of STEM workers"" in the United States. The ASEE Diversity Task Force has identified increasing the percentage of undergraduate female students to 25% by 2020 as a strategic goal. Explanations for the continued underrepresentation of women focus on the social structure of society, the social structure of STEM education and professions, and/or the content and application of STEM knowledge. This paper focuses on the pre-college experiences of first year female and male engineering students at Comprehensive Polytechnic State University (CPSU) in semi-rural California and offers lessons for recruitment based on comparative analysis of survey data collected in 2013 on 1) when the students decided to major in engineering, 2) why the students chose engineering as a major, 3) how the students made their decisions about education, and 4) who the students are and how their identities compare to dominant images of what it means to be an engineer. This paper builds on previous research by the authors, based on survey data collected in 2011, which showed that 88.29% of respondents did not make their personal decision to major in engineering until their sophomore, junior, or senior years in high school; that a higher proportion of 2011 respondents participated in English Language/English Literature AP courses and co-curricular activities such as athletics and non-STEM-related volunteer/service activities than in the ""usual places"" where we might expect to find future engineers (e.g., AP Physics, STEM programs/internships); and that 38.7% of the 2011 respondents chose to major in engineering in order to make a difference, help, or serve as a role model for others. However, the previous 2011 survey did not include any male students. This raised the question of whether the patterns identified above -and their significant recruitment implications - could be explained by the sex/gender of the first year engineering students surveyed and/or by their Millennial Generation status (born between 1981-2000). Preliminary analysis of the 2013 data suggests that the answer may be both/and rather than either/or. In the 2013 survey, 89.8% of female respondents indicated that they did not make their personal decision to major in engineering until their sophomore, junior, or senior years in high school. However, 69.8% of the male students provided the same answer. Secondly, whereas 25.6% of the 2013 female respondents indicated that making a difference, helping, or serving as a role model for others was one of their top three reasons for entering engineering, this was also the case for 14.5% of male respondents. Implications for the recruitment of female and male students will be described.",2014,,2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE,,,,WOS:000383780003066,,,#614,ASEE 2014,"",""
A gender bias habit-breaking intervention led to increased hiring of female faculty in STEMM departments,"Devine, Patricia G.; Forscher, Patrick S.; Cox, William T. L.; Kaatz, Anna; Sheridan, Jennifer; Carnes, Molly","Addressing the underrepresentation of women in science is a top priority for many institutions, but the majority of efforts to increase representation of women are neither evidence-based nor rigorously assessed. One exception is the gender bias habit-breaking intervention (Carnes et al., 2015), which, in a cluster-randomized trial involving all but two departmental clusters (N = 92) in the 6 STEMM focused schools/colleges at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, led to increases in gender bias awareness and self-efficacy to promote gender equity in academic science departments and perceptions of a more positive departmental climate. Following this initial success, the present study compares, in a preregistered analysis, hiring rates of new female faculty pre- and post-manipulation. Whereas the proportion of women hired by control departments remained stable over time, the proportion of women hired by intervention departments increased by an estimated 18 percentage points (OR = 2.23, dOR = 0.34). Though the preregistered analysis did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (p < 0.07), the study has a hard upper limit on statistical power, as the cluster-randomized trial has a maximum sample size of 92 departmental clusters. These findings, however, have undeniable practical significance for the advancement of women in science, and provide promising evidence that psychological interventions can facilitate gender equity and diversity.

Atypical, other-advocating men were judged to be low on agency and competence and penalized with job dismissal. Serial mediation analysis demonstrated that, compared with other-advocating women, other-advocating men were perceived to lack agency, which contributed to a perceived loss of competence that ultimately led to greater penalties.

Creative destruction in science,"Tierney, Warren; Hardy, Jay H. II; Ebersole, Charles R.; Leavitt, Keith; Viganola, Domenico; Clemente, Elena Giulia; Gordon, Michael; Dreber, Anna; Johannesson, Magnus; Pfeiffer, Thomas; Uhlmann, Eric Luis","Drawing on the concept of a gale of creative destruction in a capitalistic economy, we argue that initiatives to assess the robustness of findings in the organizational literature should aim to simultaneously test competing ideas operating in the same theoretical space. In other words, replication efforts should seek not just to support or question the original findings, but also to replace them with revised, stronger theories with greater explanatory power. Achieving this will typically require adding new measures, conditions, and subject populations to research designs, in order to carry out conceptual tests of multiple theories in addition to directly replicating the original findings. To illustrate the value of the creative destruction approach for theory pruning in organizational scholarship, we describe recent replication initiatives re-examining culture and work morality, working parents’ reasoning about day care options, and gender discrimination in hiring decisions. Significance statement: It is becoming increasingly clear that many, if not most, published research findings across scientific fields are not readily replicable when the same method is repeated. Although extremely valuable, failed replications risk leaving a theoretical void— reducing confidence the original theoretical prediction is true, but not replacing it with positive evidence in favor of an alternative theory. We introduce the creative destruction approach to replication, which combines theory pruning methods from the field of management with emerging best practices from the open science movement, with the aim of making replications as generative as possible. In effect, we advocate for a Replication 2.0 movement in which the goal shifts from checking on the reliability of past findings to actively engaging in competitive theory testing and theory building.

"Distinct recruitment of the hippocampal, thalamic, and amygdalar neurons projecting to the prelimbic cortex in male and female rats during context-mediated renewal of responding to food cues","Anderson, Lauren C.; Petrovich, Gorica D.","Persistent responding to food cues may underlie the difficulty to resist palatable foods and to maintain healthy eating habits. Renewal of responding after extinction is a model of persistent food seeking that can be used to study the underlying neural mechanisms. In context-mediated renewal, a return to the context in which the initial cue-food learning occurred induces robust responding to the cues that were extinguished elsewhere. Previous work found sex differences in context-mediated renewal and in the recruitment of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during that behavior. Males exhibited renewal of responding to food cues and had higher Fos induction in the prelimbic area (PL) of the vmPFC, while females failed to exhibit renewal of responding and had lower Fos induction in the PL. The main aim of the current study was to determine key components of the PL circuitry mediating renewal. The focus was on inputs from three areas important in appetitive associative learning and contextual processing: the amygdala, ventral hippocampal formation, and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. The goal was to determine whether neurons from these areas that send direct projections to the PL (identified with a retrograde tracer) are selectively activated (Fos induction) during renewal and whether they are differently recruited in males and females. The Fos induction patterns demonstrated that the PL-projecting neurons in each of these areas were recruited in a sex-specific way that corresponded to the behavioral differences between males and females. These pathways were selectively activated in the male experimental group—the only group that showed renewal behavior. The findings suggest the pathways from the ventral hippocampal formation, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and basolateral amygdala to the PL mediate renewal in males. The lack of recruitment in females suggests that under activation of these pathways may underlie their lack of renewal.

In light of increased awareness of gender-related biases encumbering equitable organizational decision making, a particularly important and timely consideration raised by Wilcox et al. was the potential for cybervetting to have a discriminatory effect on job candidates. Yet, despite this (very legitimate) concern that cybervetting may risk exacerbating such inequities, we further consider the contrary possibility that in certain contexts it may harbor some potential to mitigate them. To this end, we consider attributional augmenting as a psychological process via which cybervetting has the potential to attenuate inequitable and discriminatory hiring decisions.

Estimation of geographic variation in human papillomavirus vaccine uptake in men and women: An online survey using Facebook recruitment,"Nelson, Erik J.; Hughes, John; Oakes, J. Michael; Pankow, James S.; Kulasingam, Shalini L.","Background: Federally funded surveys of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake are important for pinpointing geographically based health disparities. Although national and state level data are available, local (ie, county and postal code level) data are not due to small sample sizes, confidentiality concerns, and cost. Local level HPV vaccine uptake data may be feasible to obtain by targeting specific geographic areas through social media advertising and recruitment strategies, in combination with online surveys. Objective: Our goal was to use Facebook-based recruitment and online surveys to estimate local variation in HPV vaccine uptake among young men and women in Minnesota. Methods: From November 2012 to January 2013, men and women were recruited via a targeted Facebook advertisement campaign to complete an online survey about HPV vaccination practices. The Facebook advertisements were targeted to recruit men and women by location (25 mile radius of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), age (18-30 years), and language (English). Results: Of the 2079 men and women who responded to the Facebook advertisements and visited the study website, 1003 (48.2%) enrolled in the study and completed the survey. The average advertising cost per completed survey was US $1.36. Among those who reported their postal code, 90.6% (881/972) of the participants lived within the previously defined geographic study area. Receipt of 1 dose or more of HPV vaccine was reported by 65.6% women (351/535), and 13.0% (45/347) of men. These results differ from previously reported Minnesota state level estimates (53.8% for young women and 20.8% for young men) and from national estimates (34.5% for women and 2.3% for men). Conclusions: This study shows that recruiting a representative sample of young men and women based on county and postal code location to complete a survey on HPV vaccination uptake via the Internet is a cost-effective and feasible strategy. This study also highlights the need for local estimates to assess the variation in HPV vaccine uptake, as these estimates differ considerably from those obtained using survey data that are aggregated to the state or federal level.

Ethnic and gender discrimination in recruitment: Experimental evidence from Finland,"Liebkind, Karmela; Larja, Liisa; Brylka, Asteria","We ask (1) how the position of an ethnic (majority or minority) group in the local ethnic hierarchy affects the amount of recruitment discrimination faced by applicants from that group, and (2) whether gender discrimination is dependent on occupational gender stereotypes in the same way among ethnic majority and minority applicants. We use the situation testing method for the first time in Finland: In an experimental study (Study 1), 103 dentistry students made recruitment decisions based on the CVs of three bogus applicants from different ethnic groups (Finnish, Austrian and Polish) and in a field experiment (Study 2), four test applicants (male and female Finns and Russians) with equivalent CVs applied for 1,258 vacant jobs, addressing gender discrimination in relation to occupational gender stereotypes as well as ethnic discrimination. Together these studies cover both skilled (Study 1) and semi-skilled jobs (Study 2) and applicants from ethnic minority groups originating from within as well as outside the EU. Results show that majority group members are more likely to be hired compared to minority members (both Studies) and that minority members from a higher status group are more likely to be hired than those from a lower status group (Study 1). Results also show that male applicants from the majority group were discriminated compared to women in occupations characterised as feminine, while Russian men faced recruitment discrimination compared to Russian women independently of the job’s gender stereotype (Study 2).

Exclusion of females in autism research: Empirical evidence for a 'leaky' recruitment‐to‐research pipeline,"D'Mello, Anila M.; Frosch, Isabelle R.; Li, Cindy E.; Cardinaux, Annie L.; Gabrieli, John D.E.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by challenges in social communication and the presence of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Notably, males are four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with autism. Despite efforts to increase representation and characterization of autistic females, research studies consistently enroll small samples of females, or exclude females altogether. Importantly, researchers often rely on standardized measures to confirm diagnosis prior to enrollment in research studies. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of one such measure (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS) on research inclusion/exclusion rates by sex in autistic adults, all of whom had a preexisting community diagnosis of autism (n = 145, 95 male, 50 female). Using the ADOS as a confirmatory diagnostic measure resulted in the exclusion of autistic females at a rate over 2.5 times higher than that of autistic males. We compared sex ratios in our sample to those in other large, publically available datasets that rely either on community diagnosis (6 datasets, total n = 42,209) or standardized assessments (2 datasets, total n = 214) to determine eligibility of participants for research. Reliance on community diagnosis rather than confirmatory diagnostic assessments resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios. These results provide evidence for a 'leaky' recruitment‐to‐research pipeline for females in autism research. Lary Summary Despite efforts to increase the representation of autistic females in research, studies consistently enroll small samples of females or exclude females altogether. We find that despite making up almost 50% of the initially recruited sample based upon self‐report of community diagnosis, autistic females are disproportonately excluded from research participation as a result of commonly used autism diagnostic measures. In our sample, and several other publically available datasets, reliance on community diagnosis resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios.

Exploring gender bias in six key domains of academic science: An adversarial collaboration,"Ceci, Stephen J.; Kahn, Shulamit; Williams, Wendy M.","We synthesized the vast, contradictory scholarly literature on gender bias in academic science from 2000 to 2020. In the most prestigious journals and media outlets, which influence many people’s opinions about sexism, bias is frequently portrayed as an omnipresent factor limiting women’s progress in the tenure-track academy. Claims and counterclaims regarding the presence or absence of sexism span a range of evaluation contexts. Our approach relied on a combination of meta-analysis and analytic dissection. We evaluated the empirical evidence for gender bias in six key contexts in the tenure-track academy: (a) tenure-track hiring, (b) grant funding, (c) teaching ratings, (d) journal acceptances, (e) salaries, and (f) recommendation letters. We also explored the gender gap in a seventh area, journal productivity, because it can moderate bias in other contexts. We focused on these specific domains, in which sexism has most often been alleged to be pervasive, because they represent important types of evaluation, and the extensive research corpus within these domains provides sufficient quantitative data for comprehensive analysis. Contrary to the omnipresent claims of sexism in these domains appearing in top journals and the media, our findings show that tenure-track women are at parity with tenure-track men in three domains (grant funding, journal acceptances, and recommendation letters) and are advantaged over men in a fourth domain (hiring). For teaching ratings and salaries, we found evidence of bias against women; although gender gaps in salary were much smaller than often claimed, they were nevertheless concerning. Even in the four domains in which we failed to find evidence of sexism disadvantaging women, we nevertheless acknowledge that broad societal structural factors may still impede women’s advancement in academic science. Given the substantial resources directed toward reducing gender bias in academic science, it is imperative to develop a clear understanding of when and where such efforts are justified and of how resources can best be directed to mitigate sexism when and where it exists.

Fleeing the ivory tower: Gender differences in the turnover experiences of women faculty,"Martinez, Larry R.; O'Brien, Katharine R.; Hebl, Michelle R.","Purpose: Prior research has established that women and men faculty have different experiences in their professional and personal lives and that academic turnover can be costly and disruptive to home institutions. However, relatively little research has examined gender differences in the antecedent events that contributed to faculty members' voluntary turnover decisions. This study aims to fill this gap. Materials and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained in two ways: by directly contacting faculty members who had voluntarily left their positions through the human resource departments at six institutions and through more wide-scale snowball sampling. The surveys, administered via paper or web based, measured the extent to which participants' experiences with harassment/discrimination, family-related issues, and recruitment/retention offers impacted their decisions to leave. Qualitative data were coded by raters into numerical values, and mean differences based on gender were assessed for these and the quantitative data. Results: Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest that female academicians reported experiencing significantly more gender-based harassment/discrimination, were much more likely to cite family-related reasons for leaving, and reported receiving significantly fewer external job offers and internal retention offers than their male counterparts. Conclusions: Academic science departments should be keenly aware of and strive to reduce instances of harassment/discrimination against female academicians, offer more support for family-related issues and encourage faculty to take advantage of these programs, and conduct search and retention efforts fairly regardless of faculty gender.

Gender bias in stem hiring: Implicit in-group gender favoritism among men managers,"Friedmann, Enav; Efrat-Treister, Dorit","Women’s underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is related to the hierarchical social structure of gender relations in these fields. However, interventions to increase women’s participation have focused primarily on women’s interests rather than on STEM managers’ hiring practices. In this research, we examine STEM hiring practices, explore the implicit bias in criteria used by STEM managers, and suggest possible corrective solutions. Using an experimental design with 213 men and women STEM managers, we show that when evaluating a female candidate, women and men STEM managers apply differential selection criteria, with men demonstrating implicit in-group gender favoritism in their hiring decisions. Specifically, the ability to work long hours was a more important criterion for male managers when evaluating a female candidate, forming an implicit gender bias, whereas female managers gave greater importance to problem-solving ability, a more gender-equal criterion. Adding a personal note to the curriculum vitae stating that the candidate had hired a full-time nanny was useful in decreasing the importance of the ability to work long hours criterion for men managers. We suggest individual and institutional interventions to reduce this bias, as a path to increasing women’s participation in STEM.

Bruce","Background: An equal number of women and men are now graduating from dental school, but women dentists have lower income and are less likely to achieve positions of leadership, including within dental academia. Materials and Methods: Demographic information and academic rank were obtained for all faculty at the eight dental schools who received the most funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2017. Years since dental school graduation, total number of PubMed-indexed citations, first- and last-author publications, and H-index were determined for each faculty member. Gender differences in productivity and advancement were evaluated. Results: Of 702 faculty members, 36.5% were female; only 24.4% of full professors were women. Men had significantly higher numbers of publications (30.2 [95% confidence interval [CI, 28.6–39.5] vs. 20.4 [95% CI 16.3–24.6], p = 0.02) and higher H-index (8.2 [95% CI 7.1–9.1] vs. 4.7 [95% CI 3.9–5.5], p < 0.0001). Women had graduated more recently than their male colleagues at all levels of academic advancement (overall 22.83 years [95% CI 21.29–24.39] vs. 30.19 years [95% CI 28.84–31.55], p < 0.0001). When corrected for academic productivity and years since graduation, the association between gender and academic rank was not significant. Conclusions: Women are underrepresented at each academic rank except instructor; however, women may advance more quickly than their male counterparts.

Hiring and intra-occupational gender segregation in software engineering,"Campero, Santiago","Women tend to be segregated into different subspecialties than men within male-dominated occupations, but the mechanisms contributing to such intra-occupational gender segregation remain obscure. In this study, I use data from an online recruiting platform and a survey to examine the hiring mechanisms leading to gender segregation within software engineering and development. I find that women are much more prevalent among workers hired in software quality assurance than in other software subspecialties. Importantly, jobs in software quality assurance are lower-paying and perceived as lower status than jobs in other software subspecialties. In examining the origins of this pattern, I find that it stems largely from women being more likely than men to apply for jobs in software quality assurance. Further, such gender differences in job applications are attenuated among candidates with stronger educational credentials, consistent with the idea that relevant accomplishments help mitigate gender differences in self-assessments of competence and belonging in these fields. Demand-side selection processes further contribute to gender segregation, as employers penalize candidates with quality assurance backgrounds, a subspecialty where women are overrepresented, when they apply for jobs in other, higher-status software subspecialties.

Hiring for gender diversity in tech,"Ly-Le, Tuong-Minh","Purpose: Gender diversity, or in-diversity, has long been a problem in the tech industry. Until now, significant gaps and barriers still exist. This paper examines how recruitment practices within the technology sector can contribute to gender inequality and how recruitment practices can be improved to support a gender-diverse organization. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted library research and case study as papers' methodologies. Findings: There are many benefits of gender diversity, including better performance, better financial returns, and lower volatility. However, most tech companies do not make diversity a priority, and usually display conscious or unconscious gender biases. Some of the recommendations to overcome this diversity issue are to make diversity a goal, offer unconscious bias training, and expand recruitment efforts. Practical implications: The findings imply that companies not pursuing a diverse workforce are in danger of experiencing lags in innovation and could be left behind. The findings also show that a technology company can increase the diversity of the company's workforce by applying practices that have already proven to be successful. Originality/value: This paper confirms that gender parity is not just a social mission nor is gender parity solely a public relations initiative to improve a company's image. Technology companies must be continually innovating to thrive in companies' highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.

Hiring preferences in online labor markets: Evidence of a female hiring bias,"Chan, Jason; Wang, Jing","Online labor marketplaces facilitate the efficient matching of employers and workers across geographical boundaries. The exponential growth of this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this importance, limited effort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may affect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-specific traits that could influence hiring outcomes. We find that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in feminine-typed occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also find that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our findings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers. Managerial and practical implications are discussed.

From October 2019 to February 2020, we sent 2315 applications to 463 job vacancies in the Paris region in France for two occupations, administrative managers and caregiver assistants, in both the private and public sectors. We find that discrimination on the grounds of disability is similar in scope to that found on the grounds of ethnicity in the profession of administrative manager, but discrimination against the disabled candidate is half that experienced by the North African candidate in the profession of caregiver assistant. Moreover, discrimination on the grounds of disability is twice as high in the profession of caregiver assistant, a role which requires more interaction with public, as in the profession of administrative manager. We do not find any evidence of a difference in callback rates based on place of residence or gender. Finally, we cannot conclude that hiring discrimination is systematically lower in the public sector than in the private sector, nor that being eligible for a public subsidy reduces hiring discrimination against the disabled candidate.

Contributing to this research, we examine the effect of organizational decision makers’ political ideology and job candidates’ gender on how the decision makers communicate information about leadership positions to the candidate.

In particular, we analyse whether discrimination against women is moderated by the occupation’s sex composition, required level of decision-making and expected educational level. To do so, we carried out a correspondence study in 2016, in which we sent two pairs of matched male–female applications to 1371 job postings for a heterogeneous selection of occupations in two large cities in Spain. Differences in response rates and response order by gender were then used as a tool to assess discrimination. The results show that job characteristics matter for gender discrimination and that their effects are complementary. Women were particularly discriminated against in connection with jobs that involved decision-making, in male-dominated and mixed occupations, and in jobs requiring both high and low education levels. This discrimination is likely to stem from the activation of both stereotypes and prejudices.

New routes to recruiting and retaining women in STEM: Policy implications of a communal goal congruity perspective,"Diekman, Amanda B.; Weisgram, Erica S.; Belanger, Aimee L.","Despite advances within a wide range of professional roles, women remain a minority in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and occupations. The gender gap in mathematics and science performance has converged, and so it is important to consider the motivational reasons that might underlie the differential STEM pursuits of women and men. The goal congruity perspective contends that a fundamental cause of gender gaps in STEM pursuits is the gender difference in communal motivation (i.e., an orientation toward others). STEM fields may be particularly likely to deter communally oriented individuals because these fields are thought to impede goals of directly benefitting others, altruism, or collaboration. In this review, we examine how the communal goal perspective might address the challenges of gender gaps in STEM pursuits from childhood through adulthood. We review the logic and evidence for the goal congruity perspective, and we examine two other deterrents to women in STEM—work‐family challenges and stereotyping—from the perspective of this framework.

Quality of breeding territory mediates the influence of paternal quality on sex ratio bias in a free-living bird population,"Bell, Sophie C.; Owens, Ian P. F.; Lord, Alexa M.","Sex allocation theory predicts that females will invest more in offspring of the sex that offers a higher fitness potential. Male offspring should be favored where direct genetic benefits from the father or indirect benefits from the parents or environment are likely to result in higher than average quality offspring. In birds, sex allocation has previously been linked to paternal quality and sexual attractiveness, but the potential importance of breeding territory quality has been largely overlooked. Using a wild population of a territorial bird species, the blue tit (Cyanistescaeruleus), we show that variation in sex ratio is associated with paternal quality, but that the relationship hinges on the quality of the breeding territory. Among broods in high-quality territories, there is a positive association between primary sex ratio and male mate condition, which is not found among broods in low-quality territories. In turn, we find that paternal quality as opposed to maternal quality is associated with chick recruitment and that the condition of the chick is predicted by an interaction of parental and territory quality, reflecting the trend in primary sex ratio bias observed in our system. These results suggest that sex allocation is influenced not only by variation in the quality of the father but also by differences between territories in the resources available for breeding, which in turn suggests an interaction between genetic and environmental effects.

The findings suggest that gender stereotypes are particularly salient in online hiring because employers typically contract for short-term, relatively low-value jobs based on limited information about job applicants. These conditions trigger the use of cognitive shortcuts about intrinsic gender characteristics linked to different skills and occupations. The results corroborate that female candidates are less likely to be hired for male-typed jobs (e.g., software development) but more likely to be hired for female-typed jobs (e.g., writing and translation) than equally qualified male candidates. Further, the study investigates three mechanisms predicted to attenuate the female penalty in male-typed jobs. The penalty is found to be self-reinforcing, as it perpetuates gender imbalances in worker activity across job categories that strengthen the sex typing of occupations.

Understanding the gender gap in advanced practice nursing: A qualitative study,"Woo, Brigitte Fong Yeong; Goh, Yong Shian; Zhou, Wentao","Aims: We aim to explore the perceptions of registered nurses undergoing the advanced practice nurse preparatory programme and of advanced practice nurses towards the recruitment of men into the advanced practice nursing workforce. Background: Given the need to expand and diversify the advanced practice nursing workforce, it is important to recognize the potential implications of gender disparity. It is critical to understand why few males are recruited into the advanced practice nursing preparatory programme and to determine whether gender-related bias is present in the professional development of nurses. Method: We use a descriptive qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom (April to August 2021). Results: Three themes were generated: ‘The odds are eventually in the favour of men’, ‘The APN career-track is unpopular among men’, and ‘Balancing the gender gap in the APN workforce’. All themes are supported by three subthemes. Conclusions: Although males in nursing enjoy opportunistic advantages in entering the advanced practice nursing workforce, they are not interested in the role and not staying long enough in the nursing profession to become advanced practice nurses. Implications for Nursing Management: Nurse managers should be more cognizant of the different social stereotypes faced by males and females in nursing. With such awareness, they can be more supportive and less biased in career counselling and job appraisals.

Upper secondary school students’ gendered interests in electronics and electrical engineering,"Naukkarinen, Johanna; Korpinen, Katriina; Silventoinen, Pertti","Background: Engineering societies call for more gender diversity, but especially girls’ interest in engineering remains low. Basic Electronics is a bachelor-level study module, offered to upper secondary school students to attract them to study electrical engineering. Recently, on average, 34% of the upper secondary school students attending the module have been girls, yet only 13% of the new electrical engineering students are female. Purpose: The objective of this study is to understand what kinds of upper secondary school students have interest in STEM in general and electronics in particular but are not considering electrical engineering as a future career. Sample and design: A questionnaire was administered to participants (age 17–18) in the Basic Electronics module in years 2017–2020 (N = 119), and the data were statistically analyzed. Results/Conclusion: Both genders seem to be interested on the practical and hands-on aspects of technology. Yet, boys are much more likely to consider studies in electrical engineering than girls. Boys receive more encouragement and guidance to act with technology both from home and from school. They also have more often technology-related hobbies. Hence, the current image of electrical engineering and other societal factors appear to be more likely to attract boys than girls to the field even among the adolescents with high general interest in STEM subjects.

'Why so few?': Differential effects of framing the gender gap in STEM recruitment interventions,"Cowgill, Colleen; Halper, Leah; Rios, Kimberly; Crane, Phoenix","Interventions designed to increase women’s participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines sometimes emphasize the STEM gender gap. Drawing upon optimal distinctiveness theory, we hypothesized that interventions overtly emphasizing women’s minority status in STEM might lead to less interest in STEM relative to interventions with subtler references to women’s minority status. In Study 1, women who viewed a STEM recruitment presentation drawing direct attention to the STEM gender gap showed lower implicit identification with STEM compared to those who viewed a presentation referencing gender through images alone. In Study 2, women’s greater feelings of unwanted distinctiveness in STEM following a presentation emphasizing the enduring gender gap (relative to one emphasizing the closing gender gap) had a significant indirect effect on their interest in STEM. In Study 3, women who viewed information about the gender distribution of a STEM company expressed less interest in the job when the same information was framed in terms of a continuing gender gap (vs. women’s growing representation), due to reduced feelings of belonging and increased feelings of unwanted distinctiveness. The present findings indicate that those designing STEM interventions targeting women should do so in ways that not only make women feel welcomed into the discipline but also do not place undue emphasis on women’s underrepresentation.

Women's inclusion and neoliberal governmentality in the Swedish digital game industry: An analysis of discursive positions and recruitment strategies,"Szczepanska, Anna Maria","Many companies within the creative industries present themselves as open and egalitarian while they are, at the same time, marked by vertical and horizontal sex‐segregation. The paper illustrates how this is particularly salient in the digital games industry and further examines how the presence of a neoliberal postfeminist discourse contributes to the neglectance of structured inequality. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews with actors in the Swedish games industry. Drawing on the theoretical perception that neoliberal logic reframes contemporary notions of gender and equality through a postfeminist discursive framework, this paper identifies and critically discusses different approaches to understand and tackle the gender divide in the Swedish games industry. While postfeminism has been characterized as apolitical or even anti‐feminist, this paper discusses how such postfeminist expressions could also be understood as connecting to the feminist project of de‐gendering. By way of conclusion, this study shows how a postfeminist discourse obscures the reality of gendered inequalities and poses limits to organizational change.

Navigating the academic ladder as an early career researcher in earth and environmental sciences,"Alderson, D.; Clarke, L.; Schillereff, D.; Shuttleworth, E.","There is growing concern in Higher Education around job security, work-life balance and inequalities, and early career researchers (ECRs) must make difficult trade-offs and life choices. Literature confirms that women navigating academia face additional challenges compared to their male counterparts. Few studies connected contractual circumstances, employment priorities and their impacts on the life choices of individual academics. We report results from a survey exploring the experiences of 37 ECRs who completed PhDs in the United Kingdom (UK) navigating the academic ladder in geomorphology and earth/environmental science, and contextualize these findings by drawing on personal experiences and wider literature. We find evidence of multi-directional pressures that have materially negative effects on individuals' life choices, including concern that academic employment is a barrier to living where and with whom one may want to. The level of precarity amongst survey respondents is stark in terms of number of years they have held fixed-term contracts (maximum 10 years), the number of individual contracts held (maximum 14) and number of different institutions worked at (maximum six). Women respondents were less prepared to be employed on precarious contracts and put more emphasis on job security when applying for academic posts, with men being generally more satisfied by financial aspects of university employment; which will amplify the leaky pipeline and gender gaps at more senior levels. We also find that perceived institutional prestige was a surprisingly low priority for the majority of respondents, and there were notable divergences between career advice given by more senior colleagues and the priorities of ECRs seeking guidance. We put forward a set of key considerations: improving policies on parental leave and flexible working; formalizing and improving mentorship; more considerate recruitment procedures; reducing contract precarity; and, transparency on pay and promotion. We believe these are within the scope of action by departments, laboratories and research groups. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2023,/,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,,,475-86,,10.1002/esp.5497,,#717,Alderson 2023,"",""
Latin American Women and Computer Science: A Systematic Literature Mapping,"Holanda, Maristela; Silva, Dilma Da","Contributions: The underrepresentation of women in computer science (CS) majors has long been a focus of attention in many academic documents, the majority of them from the United States and Europe. There is, however, a lack of information about educational interventions (EIs) for women in computing in Latin America. The contribution of this article is to cover this gap and describe what researchers in Latin American countries have been publishing about the recruitment and retention of women in the CS field. Background: Many EIs targeting female students at different educational levels - K-12, undergraduate, and graduate - have been undertaken to increase the participation of women in computing in Latin America. However, descriptions of these activities rarely are included in international academic databases. Research Questions: This literature mapping addresses two main research questions (RQ) about the topic of women in computing in academic publications in Latin American countries: RQ1) what are the characteristics of the publications about women in computing in Latin America? and RQ2) what are the published interventions to recruit and retain women in computing in Latin America? To answer RQ1, six subquestions were created covering year, language, country of origin, document type, and professional track. Furthermore, for RQ2, two subquestions were created involving educational level and the use of software development with a female theme. Methodology: This investigation used the systematic literature mapping process. To achieve a broad coverage of papers, the following sources were included: Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, the proceedings of the Latin American Women in Computing Conference (LAWCC), and those of the Women in Technology (WIT) workshop colocated with the annual conference of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). The included papers were published in the last decade (2010-2020) and written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Findings: The literature mapping encompasses 197 academic documents, 48.2% of which were written in Portuguese, 28.7% in English, and 23.1% in Spanish. The papers originated from 15 of the 20 Latin American countries. Brazil and Costa Rica have the highest number of publications overall.

Thematic analysis was used to interpret themes from the data.ResultsOur findings illustrate how Latinas, Latinos, and White women developed a strong engineering identity, which was critical to their engagement in engineering. Students' engineering identity was grounded in their perceived fit within engineering culture, sense of purpose for pursuing their degree, and resistance to the dominance of White male culture in engineering. Latinas described unique forms of gendered, racialized marginalization in engineering, whereas Latinas and Latinos highlighted prosocial motivations for completing their degree.ConclusionsFindings suggest that institutional cultures, norms, and missions are critical to broadening participation of Latinas, Latinos, and White women in engineering.

"""I try to encourage my students to think, read, and talk science"" intelligible identities in university teachers' figured worlds of higher education biology","Gunter, Katerina Pia; Ahnesjo, Ingrid; Gullberg, Annica","Higher education biology is often imagined, perceived, and described as having reached gender equality in terms of who gets to participate in disciplinary practices. However, like any other natural science discipline, higher education biology is a world whose landscapes are shaped by (re)productions of historical, cultural, and social norms. We explore these norms through the lens of identity, asking what identities are recognized by university biology teachers at a large Swedish university, analyzing 94 teaching statements written when applying for faculty positions in biology. We argue that in and through teaching statements, university biology teachers negotiate and perform overarching academic and disciplinary norms and discourses with the goal to present themselves as intelligible candidates. As statements of value, they thereby display implicit and explicit identities recognized in worlds of higher education biology. Using a discourse analytical framework, we identified two university teacher identities imagined as intelligible: Research Science Teachers and Facilitating Science Teachers. Research Science Teachers position research and associated masculine-coded competences as anchor points of biology practice. They consider researchers to be ultimate knowers and consequently to be best suitable for university teaching with the goal to recruit students into research. Facilitating Science Teachers, even though aware of the hegemonic position of research, disentangle imaginaries of what makes a researcher from what makes a university teacher. They transgress dominant imaginaries of research as the ultimate competence for themselves and students, and create spaces for alternative identity work. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of (re)productive processes in science education, providing perspectives of how to together infract intergenerational (re)productions of hegemonic norms of doing science. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that higher education biology is not a gender-neutral higher education landscape. © 2022 The Authors.

Overstaying our welcome: On the rise of women's seniority in the academy,"Stadnyk, T.A.","Issues surrounding gender equality are-and should be-front and centre in the water resources community, and other science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Very necessarily, the focus tends to be on recruitment, offering support for students and early career academics. The leaky pipeline concept used to describe the incremental loss of women from STEM fields with career duration describes a disproportionate loss of senior women, creating a parallel problem where highly qualified, top tier academics are lost from the system after significant financial and personnel investment by institutions. Ultimately, the leaky pipeline undermines the extensive investment of the hydrology and other STEM communities in equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) recruitment and retention programmes by cutting short career ambitions and the trajectories of diverse top performing individuals, resulting in no net benefit of EDIA policy investments and a lack of diversity with seniority. Addressing this critical gender gap requires the attention and support of the hydrology community of practice with specific focus on generating opportunities for advancement, confronting systemic and structural biases and improving education around allyship. Institutions and professional organizations need to consciously grow diversity in leadership and recognize and outwardly manage the perception of academic excellence around slow research and education that attracts increased diversity. Supporting allyship, reducing competitiveness among community members and reinforcing collaboration will not only attract, but retain, a higher proportion of diversity in the hydrology community, academia and STEM professions in general. It is time for the water resources (and other STEM) communities to demand broader accountability and recognition of the barriers to women, implement and reward more diverse definitions of research excellence, and offer allyship training to the community of practice at large. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2024,/,Hydrological Processes,38,5,e15166 (11 pp.),,10.1002/hyp.15166,,#726,Stadnyk 2024,"",""

"Women in physics: a comparison to science, technology, engineering, and math education over four decades","Sax, L.J.; Lehman, K.J.; Barthelemy, R.S.; Lim, G.","[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Gender in Physics.] The dearth of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields has been lamented by scholars, administrators, policymakers, and the general public for decades, and the STEM gender gap is particularly pronounced in physics. While previous research has demonstrated that this gap is largely attributable to a lack of women pursuing physics in college, prior research reveals little in terms of the characteristics and career interests of women who do plan to major in physics or how these traits have evolved over time. To address these gaps, this study utilized nationwide data on first-time, full-time college students to (1) document national trends in plans to major in physics among women entering college, (2) document the career aspirations of women who intend to major in physics, and (3) explore the characteristics of women who intend to major in physics and how this population has evolved across time. This study found that women’s interest in physics has been consistently very low in the past four decades. The most popular career aspiration among women who plan to major in physics is research scientist, although this career aspiration is declining in popularity, while increasing numbers of women say that they are undecided in their career choice. Further, this study identifies a distinctive profile of the average female physics student as compared to women in other STEM fields and women across all majors. Women who plan to pursue a physics major tend to be confident in their math abilities, value college as an opportunity to learn, plan to attend graduate school, and desire to make theoretical contributions to science. However, they are less likely than women in other fields to have a social activist orientation.

We employ a sample of 102 renewable energy generation companies from six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, and Uruguay. The analysis shows that renewable generation companies with the highest relative efficiency in the labor-capital ratio are those with the highest participation of women. In addition, the results show that renewable companies are incrementing recruitment of women in energy generation; however, their participation is still lower than the sectorial average. Considering the companies' size, bigger renewables companies tend to hire more women, but those women occupy mostly non-technical positions. In addition, women's participation decreases in positions requiring higher education. Women represent 38 % of STEM employees, 54 % of non-STEM employees, and 55 % of non-qualified employees among the total of people employed in generation companies. This trend is even more acute for renewable energy generation companies, where women represent 36 % of STEM employees, 39 % of non-STEM employees, and 48 % of non-qualified employees. Concerning the role of women in decision-making roles within energy companies, wide gender gaps exist in executive and management positions; the proportion of females in the boardroom and in management roles for renewables generation companies was 24 % and 22 %, respectively.

Multigenerational classrooms in higher education: equity and learning with technology,"Lowell, V.L.; Morris, J.M., Jr.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss potential challenges learners from different generations may have with current instructional methods using educational technologies in the classroom. The authors hope to create awareness to help improve equity in learning opportunities and assist educators in understanding the needs of multigenerational classrooms. Design/methodology/approach - In a narrative review of the literature, the authors present the current findings of the literature on generations in higher education and concerns for equity in learning opportunities. Findings - It is commonplace in undergraduate programs for learners of multiple generations to attend classes together and research has shown that historical context and generational experiences affect the values, attitudes and learning preferences of each generation. Therefore, higher education institutions should be aware of the demographic profile of their students, as well as the external populations from which they may recruit students, to ensure they are cognizant of the needs of these populations and can provide equality in learning opportunities. Practical implications - To assist with the needs of this changing student population, university leaders must consider generational characteristics to ensure equity in learning opportunity. Specifically, university leaders and educators in the classrooms will need to adapt and adjust for a changing student population providing instruction that meets the needs of multiple generations of learners, often within one classroom. Originality/value - Often when we think of diversity in the classroom we think of age, gender, race or even culture. Today we must add diversity in generations. Unlike other equity issues in education such as access (McLaughlin, 2010), educators may not be considering the equity in the design of their instruction to provide equitable learning experiences based on a learners’ knowledge and skills established by their experiences with technology. The lack of knowledge and skills a learner has with technology based on their experiences may create barriers to their ability to understand and complete instructional content involving technology (Wager, 2005). To ensure all learners can be successful, educators should strive to provide equality in learning opportunities when designing instruction including technology.",2019,/,International Journal of Information and Learning Technology,36,2,78-93,,10.1108/IJILT-06-2018-0068,,#736,Lowell 2019,"",""

An in-depth assessment of the current situation informed a theory of change, and identified seven interrelated themes to tackle this. This case study is focused on the recruitment theme. Using action research, imagery/wording used in student recruitment was updated and staff undertook equality, diversity and inclusion training. The findings demonstrate the positive effective of these interventions. For example, on one target programme, the percentage of female students increased from 8% in 2016 to 23% in 2017. © 2020 The Author(s).

The joint application of the two novel measures to a hand-collected hiring network dataset including more than 15,000 faculty members in three disparate disciplines (business, computer science, and history) leads to interesting findings regarding geographic mobility of American professors from graduating institutions, defined by relocation distance or cross-MSA from the PhD granting institution and the hiring institution. Overall, American faculty exhibits high geographic mobility from their graduating institutions in terms of relocation distance and cross-MSA moves. History faculty members have the highest mobility while those in business show the lowest mobility. We further find that assistant professors show the highest mobility while full professors show lowest mobility.

Gendered hiring and attrition on the path to parity for academic faculty,LaBerge N.; ; Wapman K.H.; Clauset A.; Larremore D.B.,"Despite long-running efforts to increase gender diversity among tenured and tenure track faculty in the U.S., women remain underrepresented in most academic fields, sometimes dramatically so. Here we quantify the relative importance of faculty hiring and faculty attrition for both past and future faculty gender diversity using comprehensive data on the training and employment of 268,769 tenured and tenure-track faculty rostered at 12,112 U.S. PhD-granting departments, spanning 111 academic fields between 2011-2020. Over this time, we find that hiring had a far greater impact on women's representation among faculty than attrition in the majority (90.1%) of academic fields, even as academia loses a higher share of women faculty relative to men at every career stage. Finally, we model the impact of five specific policy interventions on women's representation, and project that eliminating attrition differences between women and men only leads to a marginal increase in women's overall representation-in most fields, successful interventions will need to make substantial and sustained changes to hiring in order to reach gender parity.<ovid:br/>Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Fueling the future of neurosurgery: increasing trends in female enrollment expanding the neurosurgical workforce from 2010 to 2019,Smith E.C.; ; Calafiore R.L.; Oravec C.S.; Kittel C.; Wolfe S.Q.; White J.J.,"OBJECTIVE Regular reporting on recruitment of women into neurosurgery is a mechanism to track the progress of minority inclusion and diversity. For more than 20 years, half of US medical students have been women, yet a disproportionate minority pursue a career in neurosurgery. The authors previously published data tracking women in neurosurgery for the prior decade from 2000 to 2009, which showed an increasing match rate of women over time, from 18 women matched at the beginning of the decade to 36 matched at the end. They now present updated data on the matriculation of women into neurosurgical residencies across the most recent decade, from 2010 to 2019. METHODS Public databases from the Association of American Medical Colleges were analyzed for applicants to neurosurgical residency from 2010 to 2019. Demographic data for those matched was obtained from the American Medical Association Masterfile and analyzed for year of match and gender. Secondary outcomes included program location, age, and gap year(s) between medical school and residency. RESULTS Women made up 18.8% (394/2094) of residents matched into neurosurgery from 2010 to 2019, compared to 12% during the previous decade. There was an increase in overall match rate of 2.2% per year (male + female) from 2010 to 2019, representing the predicted need for expansion of the neurosurgical workforce to meet national needs. Women made up the majority of this expansion, rising by 5.5% over the time period (p = 0.002), compared to men increasing by 1.4% over the time period (p = 0.096). The percentage of women applicants who matched was 34.4%, compared to men at 38.6% (p = 0.009). There was no significant difference in gender with regard to age, number of gap years, or program location. CONCLUSIONS The number of women matching into neurosurgery has continued to increase across the last 2 decades. Despite this, there remains significant disparity between the number of men and women matching into neurosurgery. Ongoing mitigation of barriers to recruitment of women into neurosurgery is critical.

Fostering diversity and inclusion in the preempt CRC study through strategic site selection and innovative recruitment tools,Shaukat A.; ; Kutnik K.; Petersen K.R.; Xu C.; Lee L.C.; Baldo L.; Levin T.R.,"Background: Diversity in clinical studies is crucial in aligning the study population with the intended patient demographic. Freenome is developing a blood based test (MyTectCRC) intended to offer a convenient and accessible option for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Its clinical validation is supported by the PREEMPT CRC study, a prospective, multi-center observational study. PREEMPT CRC was able to achieve a diverse population representing various ethnic, racial, and geographical backgrounds that reflect the United States population. This analysis evaluates the significance of strategic site selection and use of forward-thinking study tools in achieving a diverse and inclusive study population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Starting in 2020, PREEMPT CRC enrolled participants aged 45-85 at average CRC risk. Eligible and consenting participants underwent a blood draw and a screening colonoscopy, with the blood sample analyzed by MyTectCRC. To ensure diversity, strategic site selection was employed beyond large academic institutions and hospitals to smaller sites and community hospitals. The study also incorporated a decentralized clinical trial (DCT) model to reach broader geographical areas and used electronic consenting and mobile phlebotomy (MP) services to facilitate enrollment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): PREEMPT CRC enrolled 48,995 participants and achieved ethnic/racial diversity comparable to 2020 U.S. Census for Blacks (11.2%, vs 13.6%), Asians (6.8%, vs 6.3%) and Hispanic or Hispanic/Latinx (11.2%, vs 19.1%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.3% vs 0.4%). The primary site types were community hospitals and regional clinics, accounting for 45.5% of all sites, followed by health systems (12.0%), research institutes (18.5%), and academic centers/teaching hospitals (16.0%). The community clinics and academic centers enrolled the highest proportion of Black participants within their sites (21.4% and 12.1%, respectively) Research institutions had the highest proportion of Asian (24.8%) and Hispanic/Latinx (18.3%) populations. There was no significant difference observed in male versus female distribution between site types. Within traditional sites, 32% used MP service. DCT enrolled 12,137 participants (24.7% of total) from every state in the U.S., including high representation from rural areas (24.5%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): PREEMPT CRC integrated multiple methodologies and tools to enhance diversity and inclusivity.

Recent trends show a decline in the number of blood donors, threatening blood supplies for medical treatments. This study aims to identify factors that influence blood donation decisions and behaviors among young Saudi Arabian adults to develop strategies to enhance donation rates. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 407 university students in Riyadh Province (Shaqra, Riyadh City, Al-Majmaah and Al-Duwadimi) and occurred from December 2022 to May 2023, using convenience sampling. Data were collected via online questionnaires and analyzed using logistic regression. Results. Findings revealed a significant gender disparity in donation rates with males more likely to donate. Knowledge gaps were prevalent, especially regarding eligibility criteria. Support for organ donation, prior experience of receiving blood, and high levels of self-determined motivation positively associated with donation likelihood. Conversely, amotivation was a strong negative predictor of donation. Conclusion.

In addition, widespread use of pass/fail grading has led to noncomparable data. To adjust to these challenges, we developed a holistic review (HR) rubric for scoring residency applicants for interview selection. DESIGN: Single-center observational study comparing the proportion of underrepresented in medicine (URM) students and their United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) scores who were invited for interview before (2015-2020) and after (2022) implementation of a holistic review process. SETTING: General surgery residency program at a tertiary academic center. PARTICIPANTS: US allopathic medical students applying for general surgery residency. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): After initial screening, a total of 1514 allopathic applicants were narrowed down to 586 (38.7%) for HR. A total of 52% were female and 17% identified as URM. Based on HR score, 20% (118/586) of applicants were invited for an interview. The median HR score was 11 (range 4-19). There was a fourfold higher coefficient of variation of HR scores (22.3; 95% CI 21.0-23.7) compared to USMLE scores (5.1; 95% Cl 4.8-5.3), resulting in greater spread and distinction among applicants. There were no significant differences in HR scores between genders (p = 0.60) or URM vs non-URM (p = 0.08). There were no significant differences in Step 1 (p = 0.60) and 2CK (p = 0.30) scores between those who were invited to interview or not.

Women in pain medicine,Johnson N.; ; Siew S.; Black S.,"In the UK more women than men are practicing medicine, and for the first time in the history of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA), the president of the RCoA, Dean of the Faculty of Pain Medicine, and Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine are all women. However, within the subspecialty of pain medicine, there are significantly more men practicing than women, with the most recent UK estimates identifying that only 26.7% of current pain physicians are women. Both historical and modern perspectives illustrate how women often prefer to be cared for by other women, highlighting the importance of increased representation of women in pain clinics and interventional suites. We discuss current trends in pain medicine recruitment within the UK, where most pain physicians are recruited from anaesthesia training programs, including the barriers to women's representation and reasons women enter the subspecialty. We advocate for speaker gender quotas at conferences, diversity considerate workforce planning, peer support groups, adjustments to training programs, and further research to help narrow the gender gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 British Journal of Anaesthesia",2023,/,British Journal of Anaesthesia,131,5,801EP  - 804,2025717062,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2023.06.043,37442726,#759,Johnson 2023,"",""
Gender Differences in Letters of Recommendation for Gynecology Surgical Fellowship Applicants: Analysis of One Program's Recruitment Cycle,Lim S.-I.; ; Mueller M.; Mou T.; Jones S.; Tanner E.; Chaudhari A.; Kenton K.; Brown O.,"Study Objective: To examine whether there are gender differences in letters of recommendation (LORs) written for residents applying to gynecology surgical fellowships. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Retrospective study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Single, academic institution. <ovid:br/>Patient(s): LORs for applicants to gynecology oncology, urogynecology, and minimally invasive gynecology fellowships during the 2019-2020 application cycle. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Not applicable. <ovid:br/>Measurements and Main Results: We analyzed the linguistic content of the letters for the presence of 4 summary variables and 21 word categories based on previous studies using validated computerized text analysis software. We used multivariable analysis using linear mixed models to compare linguistic characteristics of letters by applicant gender. We performed qualitative content analysis on letters and compared the frequency of code themes by gender. The mixed-method design was planned to allow for analysis of domains not captured in text analysis. Among 680 letters written for 186 applicants, 124 (18.2%) were written for men, and 556 (81.8%) were written for women. There were no differences in the least square mean (standard error) word counts for LORs written for men and women applicants, 465 (20.0) vs 458(9.4) words, p = .74. In multivariable analysis, LORs written for men were found to have higher authentic tone and more risk words (p = .005 and p = .03, respectively). LORs written for women contained more communal (relationship-oriented) words (p = .006). The qualitative analysis demonstrated that ability, interpersonal traits, surgical skills, and research were the most often mentioned themes. Comments about compassion/empathy, leadership potential, teaching, interpersonal skills, and patient rapport were found more often in letters for men. More doubt raisers (words that raise doubt or concern) were present in letters for men, but letters for both genders had similar levels of negative criticism. In contrast, comments on ability, being ""drama-free,"" and self-awareness were found more often in letters for women. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There were gender differences in LORs written for obstetrics and gynecology surgical subspecialty fellowship applicants indicating the presence of gender bias.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 AAGL",2023,/,Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,30,5,406EP  - 413,2023030337,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2023.01.014,36736768,#760,Lim 2023,"",""
"Gender, race-ethnicity and postdoctoral hiring in STEMM fields",Shauman K.A.; ; Huynh J.,"As postdoctoral training has become a requirement in many STEMM fields the influence of postdoc hiring on STEMM labor force inclusion and diversity has increased, yet postdoc hiring processes have received only limited attention from researchers. Drawing on status theory and data for 769 postdoctoral recruitments, we systematically analyze the relationship between gender, race-ethnicity, and postdoctoral hiring. The findings show: (1) differences by gender and race-ethnicity in application rates, and in whether an applicant is seriously considered, interviewed, and offered the postdoc position; (2) hiring disparities correlate with between-group differences in applicants' network connections, referrer prestige, and academic human capital; (3) between-group differences in network connections have the greatest power to account for hiring disparities; and (4) hiring processes may differ by applicant gender or race-ethnicity, the female representation in the STEMM field and the race of the search committee chair.

Effective recruitment strategies are critically important for successful clinical trials. Framing treatment risks are known to affect medical decision-making for both physicians and patients but has not been rigorously studied in surgical trials.

"Gender, academic power and citizenship - the impact of international recruitment on gender balance in climate research",Vabo A.; ; Schmidt E.K.; Egeland C.; Franssen T.,"Research and higher education have been strongly influenced by change processes related to international cooperation and global competition to create world-leading research environments. In Norway, a small country with large public investments in research [1], international collaboration and recruitment to raise the quality of research have been strong driving forces. Today, the majority of qualified applicants for Norwegian professorships comes from institutions abroad, and foreign researchers make up approx. 30 per cent of the total number of professionals in the sector. Despite the great political interest in internationalisation and recruitment of foreign researchers, there has been limited research on the importance of international recruitment for the research environments [2], the research agendas and the local power structures. Gender equality and internationalisation policy have functioned as two separate fields in research policy. Nonetheless, in its recent internationalisation action plan, the Research Council of Norway states that international mobility ought to safeguard gender balance and consider the gender dimension in research and innovation. The study presented herewith is carried out in the frame of the project Gender, Academic Power and Citizenship, funded by the Programme on Gender Balance in Senior Positions and Research Management (BALANSE) of the Research Council of Norway [3], aiming at bringing structural and cultural change in the research system. The study explores the impact of internationalisation on the gender balance within climate research. As a result of international recruitment, the proportion of women is rising - but gender is constructed in manifold ways in different academic contexts. Here we look at climate research in the light of a horizontal understanding of globalised research communities. The presentation is based on quantitative data, policy documents and in-depth interviews with foreign women and men in climate research, where Norway has a renowned research environment. International recruitment has contributed to an increase in the proportion of women in STEM and at professor level [4]. The case of climate research shows that international recruitment has contributed to a transformation of the field - both in terms of gender composition, distribution of power and resources in a gender perspective, and renewed research agendas [5]. Moreover, the findings point to that international recruitment for gender balance should be analysed from an intersectional perspective, as foreign researchers are not a homogeneous group, and consider the complexity that characterises the field as disciplines have different epistemic, organisational and social characteristics.",2023,/,BMC Proceedings,17,Supplement 15,,643048831,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12919-023-00275-w,,#764,Vabo 2023,"",""
"Recruitment, retention, and attrition of medical students interested in ophthalmology before and after medical school in the U.S",Xu C.; ; Herrera M.; Copparam S.; Hou M.; Yiu G.,"Purpose : Ophthalmology is one of the least diverse medical specialties in the U.S. We describe differences in gender and race between students who intend to pursue ophthalmology at matriculation and who actually pursue ophthalmology at graduation from U.S. medical schools. Methods : This is a cohort study of medical students who responded to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Matriculating Student Questionnaire (MSQ), administered to first-year medical students from 2013-2021, and the Graduation Questionnaire (GQ), given to expected graduates between 2017-2022. We collected selfreported age, sex, race, and specialty preference from matched questionnaires to distinguish students who 1) expressed initial interest and pursued ophthalmology, 2) reported initial interest in ophthalmology but did not pursue ophthalmology, and 3) did not report initial interest but pursued ophthalmology at graduation. Comparisons were made by chi-square analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results : Among 134,723 U.S. medical students who responded to the MSQ between 2013- 2021 and 98,628 students who responded to the GQ between 2017-2022, we identified 68,220 students who completed both questionnaires. Of 1,096 students who expressed initial interest in ophthalmology at matriculation, 357 (32.6%) intended to practice this specialty at graduation. 1,061 students indicated pursuing ophthalmology at graduation while not having expressed initial interest. Among the 739 (67.4%) students who lost interest in ophthalmology, 49.8% were female, compared to 39.5% in the group who sustained and 42.1% in the group who gained interest (p < 0.001). The proportion of students who identified as White, Black, Asian, or Hispanic differed between the groups who sustained, lost, or gained interest (Table 1, p = 0.003). White students made up the majority of those who sustained (58.8%) or gained (52.4%) interest in ophthalmology, compared to those who lost interest (46.3%). Conclusions : There is high attrition of the number of medical students interested in ophthalmology from the beginning of medical school to graduation.

Recruitment of women in neurosurgery: a 7-year quantitative analysis,Feghali J.; ; Antar A.; Wicks E.E.; Sattari S.A.; Li S.; Witham T.F.; Brem H.; Huang J.,"OBJECTIVE The authors aimed to characterize which US medical schools have the most female neurosurgery residents and to identify potential associations between medical school characteristics and successful recruitment of women pursuing a neurosurgery career. METHODS The authors evaluated a total of 1572 residents in US neurosurgery programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education as of February 2021, representing match cohorts from 2014 to 2020. The authors extracted US medical school characteristics and ranked schools based on the percentages of women graduates entering neurosurgery. They additionally studied yearly trends of the percentage of women constituting incoming neurosurgery resident cohorts as well as associations between female recruitment percentage and medical school characteristics using univariable and stepwise multivariable linear regression (including significant univariable factors). RESULTS The cohort consisted of 1255 male and 317 (20%) female residents. Yearly trends indicated a significant drop in incoming female residents in 2016, followed by significant increases in 2017 and 2019. On multivariable analysis, the following factors were associated with a higher average percentage of female graduates entering neurosurgery: total affiliated neurosurgery clinical faculty (beta = 0.006, 95% CI 0.001-0.011, p = 0.01), allopathic versus osteopathic schools (beta = 0.231, 95% CI 0.053-0.409, p = 0.01), and top 10 U.S. News & World Report ranking (beta = 0.380, 95% CI 0.129-0.589, p < 0.01). When the number of female clinical faculty was added to the model, the variable was not statistically significant. Multivariable bibliometric analyses indicated a higher mean preresidency H-index for men, with an even greater gender difference identified in the 2021 H-index. CONCLUSIONS This study characterizes which medical schools are most successful at recruiting female students who constituted the total neurosurgery resident workforce of the 2020-2021 academic year. The overall number of clinical neurosurgery faculty rather than faculty gender was independently associated with female recruitment. Gender differences in research productivity persisted with control for confounders and increased between preresidency and 2021 time points.

"Gender coding in job advertisements for academic, non-academic, and leadership positions in emergency medicine",O'Brien K.; ; Petra V.; Lal D.; Kwai K.; McDonald M.; Wallace J.; Jeanmonod C.; Jeanmonod R.,"Objectives: Gender disparities continue to exist in emergency medicine (EM) despite increasing percentages of women in medical school and residencies. Prior studies in other male dominated industries have shown using masculine or feminine-coded language in job advertisements affects the proportion of male versus female applicants who choose to apply for those jobs. The goal of this study was to determine if gender-coding exists in EM job advertisements, and to see if there were differences between academic vs. non-academic jobs or administrative vs. non-administrative jobs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a cross sectional study of EM jobs advertised in the United States on 13 academic and non-academic medical job databases from September 2020-February 2021. Using a gender decoder program based on prior research by Gaucher et al. on gendered wording in job advertisements, we analyzed each job to determine if the job advertisement was overall highly masculine, masculine, highly feminine, feminine, or neutral. Each job was categorized as academic, non-academic, administrative, or non-administrative. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Seventy-four EM job advertisements were posted during the study period. Forty-four (59.4%) of these coded out as masculine or strongly masculine, 18 (24.3%) coded out as feminine or strongly feminine, and 12 (16.2%) were neutral. Only one job advertisement contained no gender-coded words. There were no differences in the gender-coding of academic, non-academic, or administrative jobs. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Job advertisements for EM physicians tend to contain more masculine-coded language. Almost all job advertisements for emergency medicine physicians in this study contained at least one gender-coded word.

Intersectional Stigma for Autistic People at Work: A Compound Adverse Impact Effect on Labor Force Participation and Experiences of Belonging,Doyle N.; ; Mcdowall A.; Waseem U.,"Background: Little research addresses the experiences of autistic people at work, yet employment prospects remain bleak. The extant literature takes a largely remedial perspective and does not focus on harnessing this population's considerable talents. In global organizational practice, several programs purposefully target autistic people for their abilities. However, preliminary evidence suggests that such programs are inadvertently attracting mainly White males, to the exclusion of other demographics. Therefore, stigma surrounding autism at work remains, creating potential compound adverse impacts by marginalizing identities, including gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. We explored the intersection of autism with other marginalizing identities in the context of work. The research focused on labor force participation for autistic people and, for those in employment, perceptions of exclusion and inclusion. We compared the aforementioned variables by gender identity, racial identity, sexuality, socioeconomic background, and geographic origin. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We undertook a global cross-sectional survey, advertised through various social media platforms and promoted directly to relevant organizations. The survey included a range of validated measures as well as demographic information. We analyzed the data with frequencies, cross tabulations, chi-square tests, and non-parametric, group-wise comparisons. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We found preliminary evidence of reduced rates of employment participation by race and geographic location. Females and non-binary people had lower perceptions of inclusion and belonging at work. The perception of accommodation provision had a strong association with inclusion and belonging; more so than incidental provision of flexibility in environment and scheduling not framed as a specific accommodation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings highlight the relational aspects of accommodation and a more universal inclusion perspective. We urge practitioners and researchers to monitor employment participation and levels of inclusion/exclusion using intersectional demographic identification.

Our analyses show universal inequalities in which a small minority of universities supply a large majority of faculty across fields, exacerbated by patterns of attrition and reflecting steep hierarchies of prestige. We identify markedly higher attrition rates among faculty trained outside the United States or employed by their doctoral university. Our results indicate that gains in women's representation over this decade result from demographic turnover and earlier changes made to hiring, and are unlikely to lead to long-term gender parity in most fields.

Some bias persisted, but rubric use should be encouraged",Blair-Loy M.; ; Mayorova O.V.; Cosman P.C.; Fraley S.I.,"Research has documented the presence of bias against women in hiring, including in academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Hiring rubrics (also called criterion checklists, decision support tools, and evaluation tools) are widely recommended as a precise, cost-effective remedy to counteract hiring bias, despite a paucity of evidence that they actually work (see table S8). Our in-depth case study of rubric usage in faculty hiring in an academic engineering department in a very research-active university found that the rate of hiring women increased after the department deployed rubrics and used them to guide holistic discussions. Yet we also found evidence of substantial gender bias persisting in some rubric scoring categories and evaluators' written comments. We do not recommend abandoning rubrics. Instead, we recommend a strategic and sociologically astute use of rubrics as a department self-study tool within the context of a holistic evaluation of semifinalist candidates.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It is unknown whether telephone outreach improves participation among these historically underrepresented patients. We assessed the effect of telephone outreach in addition to standard mail survey recruitment in a population-based ACP pragmatic trial at three academic health systems in California. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): English and Spanish-speaking primary care patients with serious illness (metastatic cancer, organ failure, ALS, adults with a serious condition over age 75) and no recent ACP were invited by mail to participate in a longitudinal survey study. Patients who did not initially respond were called by staff up to 3 times to remind them of the mailed survey or help complete the survey over the telephone. We examined the effect of telephone outreach on the participation of underrepresented patients and the recruitment of a more representative sample by assessing demographic characteristics. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Across the health systems, 5,998 seriously ill patients were mailed surveys. The mean age was 72 years and mean Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was 0.38 (range 0-1, with 1 being most vulnerable). Patients were 52% male, 14% non-English speaking, 53% White, 18% Hispanic, 11% Asian, 9% Black, and 9% other race/ethnicity.

The study objective is to investigate which program factors were considered most important by radiology residency applicants and to assess for differences by gender, race and ethnicity. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): An anonymous survey was distributed electronically to diagnostic and interventional radiology residency programs in the US and Canada via the Association of Program Coordinators in Radiology (APCR). Residents were asked to evaluate the importance of 30 factors during evaluation of residency programs using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not important, 5 = extremely important). <ovid:br/>Result(s): 370 residents and 1 fellow completed the survey. Of the respondents, 269 were male (72.5%) and 101 were female (27.2%). The most important factors to respondents during program selection were program culture (4.42), geographic location (4.17), fellowship placement (4.14), and imaging and/or procedure volume (3.98). There was a significant difference between male and female respondents in the importance of program culture (p = 0.002), composition of current residents (p = 0.007), percentage of current female residents (p < 0.0001), program size (p = 0.047), call schedule (p = 0.025), percentage of female faculty (p < 0.0001), faculty ethnic and racial diversity (p < 0.0001), resident ethnic and racial diversity (p < 0.0001), which female respondents ranked more highly. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Applicants consider many factors during residency program selection.

"Increasing diversity in cardiovascular clinical trials: Engagement, recruitment, and leadership",Thabane L.; ; Gee P.; Yancy C.; Van Spall H.; Lopes R.; Douglas P.S.; Garaygordobil D.A.; Ortega R.; Noreenwalsh M.,"Cardiovascular clinical trials inform practice and policy for conditions that have a high disease burden on populations across the world. While the results of these trials are applied broadly, trial participants often do not reflect the diverse patients in whom the results are applied and we rely on anecdotal and observational data to establish the safety and efficacy of treatments in these groups. Diversity is also lacking among clinical trialists, and this appears to be one of the several factors associated with the homogeneity of clinical trial participants. In this 90-min session that includes patients, cardiovascular researchers, and national society leaders, we will present data on the under-representation of women, the elderly, and those from vast geographic regions in the world as clinical trial participants. We will discuss the impact of this under-representation on clinical care. Similarly, we will present data on the relative gender and geographic homogeneity among clinical trial leaders, with a focus on lead/senior authors of trial publications and trial executive committees. We will discuss factors associated with the under-representation of demographic groups as participants and leaders of trials and propose strategies at the clinical trial, institutional, medical society, and academic publishing level that could address these gaps.

Should dental school faculty be measured and compensated using academic productivity models? Two viewpoints,Hoskin E.R.; ; Bertone M.; Chun Y.-H.P.; Lee A.L.; Motahari M.Z.; Martin A.B.,"Operationalizing faculty contributions in ways that align with organizational mission can be difficult, particularly when monetizing effort. Conventional compensation methods may result in faculty effort going undefined, resulting in more subjectivity in recognition and compensation. Inequities lead to faculty marginalization, fragmentation, decreased motivation, and attrition. Dental faculty retirements are expected to increase, as 81% of men and 19% of women faculty aged 60 years and older in 2015-2016. We present opposing perspectives on the use of educational value units (EVUs) in academic dentistry. The first viewpoint articulates that such models improve recruitment and retention by objectifying (a) faculty performance measurement, (b) academic productivity improvements, and (c) compensation determination. The counterpoint suggests EVUs are deterrents to faculty retention due to challenges with objectively quantifying performance measures, a potential inherent bias linked to gender, and the undervaluing of teaching quality or collaborative practices.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 American Dental Education Association.",2020,/,Journal of dental education,84,5,534EP  - 542,631794417,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12051,32064617,#779,Hoskin 2020,"",""
The working experiences of male nurses in China: Implications for male nurse recruitment and retention,Zhang H.; ; Tu J.,"AIMS: To understand the working experiences and career trajectories of male nurses in China. BACKGROUND: Compared with developed countries, men were far more under-represented in the nursing profession in China. Little is known about the working experiences of Chinese male nurses and the contextual factors that contribute to their low participation rate in the nursing profession. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In-depth interviews with twenty-five male nurses and two hospital administrators were conducted. All interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Chinese male nurses had better career prospects and promotion chances compared with female nurses. The extremely low participation rate of men in nursing was related to the prejudice among the general public as well as the low professional status and salary. Two unique contextual factors influenced the career trajectories of male nurses in China: (1) the major assignment mechanism in the college entrance examination and (2) the implementation of the two-child policy. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Although Chinese male nurses enjoyed many advantages compared with female nurses, they also encountered many difficulties related to working in a female-dominated profession.

Women in Cardiology in Australia-Are We Making Any Progress?,Segan L.; ; Vlachadis Castles A.,"Women remain largely under-represented in cardiology worldwide, despite gender parity among medical graduates. This is particularly notable in procedural subspecialties such as interventional cardiology and electrophysiology and is consistent at all levels of training. Cardiology continues to have the lowest proportion of females of all adult medicine specialties. This is a review of existing literature and statistics pertaining to women in cardiology and highlights the relative paucity of data or publications within Australia. Australian data from the Medical Training Review Panel reported that the proportion of females in cardiology advanced training (~22%) has not changed over the last 9 years and that there is a significant attrition as trainees progress through the various stages of training. In 2018, females represent only 16% of first year cardiology advanced trainees in Victoria and Tasmania. This represents a decrease from 20-25% in previous years. The factors affecting gender parity in cardiology are complex and diverse, from personal reasons such as family planning, work-life balance and perceived gender bias, to recruitment inertia and an imbalance in opportunities for career progression, research, financial remuneration and leadership positions. Worldwide, a number of initiatives have been explored to address the gender divide in cardiology, including networking and mentorship programs and Women in Cardiology working groups, dedicated to addressing the issue of female under-representation in cardiology. Unfortunately, the progress we are seeing worldwide is not being realised in Australia. A collaborative approach is essential to achieve gender parity in cardiology. This involves introspection and accountability by College bodies and policy changes committed to promoting workplace diversity by welcoming and retaining female talent. We must recognise and address the current barriers and support women pursuing a career in cardiology.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",2019,/,Heart Lung and Circulation,28,5,690EP  - 696,2001541819,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2018.12.010,30738714,#782,Segan 2019,"",""

There were no statistically significant differences in enrollment based on gender ( P = .88) or elapsed time between recruitment contacts ( P = .22). However, nonparticipants were slightly older ( P = .02). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S):: Our finding that individuals were more likely to enroll within the first 3 phone calls suggests that recruitment efforts should be focused on making initial contacts with potential participants, rather than continuing attempts to those who are unable to be contacted easily.

138 An Approach to Detecting Sex Bias in Residency Recruitment,Jayaprakash N.; ; Marks A.; Folt J.; Lewandowski C.; Goyal N.,"Study Objectives: Studies have noted sex disparities in emergency medicine (EM) in which women are less likely to hold leadership positions and advance in academic ranks. The objective of this study was to explore whether women are treated differently from men during the residency recruitment process. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a single center retrospective analysis of the recruitment data for Henry Ford Hospital EM (HFHEM) residency from 2015 to 2018. We included all United States (US) graduates who applied to our residency and stratified by sex. Data was abstracted from local databases of applicant scores related to their file score, interview score and composite scores (file score + interview score) as well as data related to their position on the final rank list. The file score is generated by a detailed review of all data in each applicant's file and primarily reflects their academic performance in medical school. The interview score reflects the applicant's communication and professionalism skill as assessed by multiple faculty interviewers. We additionally reviewed the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) data regarding sex distribution for 2015 - 2018 for benchmarking. We were primarily interested in the median position on the rank list of women versus men. Secondarily we compared the file, interview, and composite score of women versus men. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 2015 through 2018, 224 (34.5%) women and 425 (65.5%) men were ranked and submitted to the National Residency Matching Program on behalf of our residency program. Nationally, during the same time period amongst all applicants, 5168 women (34.3%) applied to EM via ERAS compared to 9900 (65.7%) men. At HFHEM, taking into account all applicants, we had 1441 (33.5%) women and 2866 (66.5%) men. The median (IQR) position on the HFHEM rank order list for women was 72.5 (37 - 111.5) and for men was 88 (43 - 128), p = 0.013. The average (+/-SD) interview score for women was 18.7 (+/-2.2) and for men 18.1 (+/-2.5), p = 0.01. We did not find a statistically significant difference between the file scores for women compared to men (35.5 +/-4.5 vs. 34.5 +/-5.2, p = 0.18). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The HFHEM residency rank lists reflect similar distributions of women and men compared to the national applicant pool. Our recruitment process generates similar scores for the academic proficiency of both women and men and our scoring at the interview suggests a higher performance for women than men. Ultimately, women rank more competitively on our rank lists compared to men.

One approach to improve the effectiveness of donor recruitment is to target influencing factors. A yearly league is conducted at the Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) to encourage university students and faculty to donate blood. During this, the colleges are evaluated based on different measures including the number of donors recruited from each college and the efforts made by the students in increasing the awareness of blood donation in the colleges and in the society via different means including the utilization of the social media. The whole competition is organized and ran by an independent group of students. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This study aims at studying the impact of the yearly SQU college competition on the perception of blood donation among SQU students. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A comprehensive anonymous voluntary survey was developed and used to assess perception of students aged 18-25 attending SQU and other universities (non-SQU) over a two years' period. Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. Categorized variables were presented in numbers with percentages and associations between the groups were analyzed using Chi-square test. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 600 students were surveyed (300 SQU, 300 non-SQU). There was no statistical difference between SQU and non-SQU students with regard to past history of blood donation and the number of donations made.

There was no statistical difference between male and female donors on their perception of level of self-knowledge on blood donation (P = 0.868). About 84% of the youth agreed that blood donation is one of the duties toward the community. SQU students reported higher rates of respond to specific requests for blood donation (44.3% vs 29.7%, P < 0.001). SQU students reported greater influence of peers (84% vs 60.7%, P < 0.001), personal knowledge (82% vs 74.7%, P = 0.029) and personal experience (79.3% vs 69%, P = 0.005) when compared to non-SQU students.

Given that women account for only 31% of surgical residents but make up half of all medical students, we specifically examined gender differences in these factors. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Electronic surveys were distributed to first and second year medical students with no previous exposure to surgical rotations. Responses were analyzed using the chi-square test. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Ninety-one surveys were completed: 37 male (40.7%), and 54 female (59.3%). The number of hours worked were the main deterrent for pursuing a career in surgery for both men and women (83.8% and 83.3%, respectively, p=0.9546). The perception of surgery as a male-dominated field was the main factor that was significantly different based on gender (0% male, 20.4% female, p=0.0024). On the other hand, nearly 75% of medical students most valued shadowing gender-matched surgeons in the operating room, and 63% of students were interested in a formal mentoring relationship (Table). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): More than 20% of female medical students identify that the perception of surgery as being a male-dominated field discouraged them from choosing it as a career. Educators and surgeons have the opportunity to support student interest in surgery by establishing formal mentorship programs and providing opportunities for informal mentoring relationships and shadowing in the operating room.",2018,/,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,227,4 Supplement 1,S226EP  - S227,638697945,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.07.496,,#792,Peterson 2018,"",""
Identifying applicants suitable to a career in nursing: a value-based approach to undergraduate selection,Traynor M.; ; Galanouli D.; Roberts M.; Leonard L.; Gale T.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to complement existing evidence on the suitability of Multiple Mini Interviews as a potential tool for the selection of nursing candidates on to a BSc (Hons) nursing programme., BACKGROUND: This study aimed to trial the Multiple Mini Interview approach to recruitment with a group of first year nursing students (already selected using traditional interviews)., DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study. This paper reports on the evaluation of the participants' detailed scores from the Multiple Mini Interview stations; their original interview scores and their end of year results., METHODS: This study took place in March 2015. Scores from the seven Multiple Mini Interview stations were analysed to show the internal structure, reliability and generalizability of the stations. Original selection scores from interviews and in-course assessment were correlated with the MMI scores and variation by students' age, gender and disability status was explored., RESULTS: Reliability of the Multiple Mini Interview score was moderate (G = 0.52). The Multiple Mini Interview score provided better differentiation between more able students than did the original interview score but neither score was correlated with the module results. Multiple Mini Interview scores were positively associated with students' age but not their gender or disability status., CONCLUSION: The Multiple Mini Interview reported in this study offers a selection process that is based on the values and personal attributes regarded as desirable for a career in nursing and does not necessarily predict academic success. Its moderate reliability indicates the need for further improvement but it is capable of discriminating between candidates and shows little evidence of bias.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2017,/,Journal of advanced nursing,73,6,1443EP  - 1454,621193679,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jan.13227,27905663,#796,Traynor 2017,"",""
Understanding the Barriers to Hiring and Promoting Women in Surgical Subspecialties,Valsangkar N.; ; Fecher A.M.; Rozycki G.S.; Blanton C.; Bell T.M.; Freischlag J.; Ahuja N.; Zimmers T.A.; Koniaris L.G.,"Background The objective of this study was to characterize potential disparities in academic output, NIH-funding, and academic rank between male and female surgical faculty and identify subspecialties in which these differences may be more pronounced. Study Design Eighty metrics for 4,015 faculty members at the top-55 NIH-funded departments of surgery were collected. Demographic characteristics, NIH funding details, and scholarly output were analyzed. A new metric, academic velocity (V), reflecting recent citations is defined. Results Overall, 21.5% of surgical faculty are women. The percentage of female faculty is highest in science/research (41%) and surgical oncology (34%), and lowest in cardiothoracic surgery (9%). Female faculty are less likely to be full professors (22.7% vs 41.2%) and division chiefs (6.2% vs 13.6%). The fraction of women who are full professors is lowest in cardiothoracic surgery. Overall median numbers of publications/citations are lower for female faculty compared with male surgical faculty (21 of 364 vs 43 of 723, p < 0.001), and these differences are more pronounced for assistant professors. Current/previous NIH funding (21.3% vs 24%, p = NS) rates are similar between women and men, and surgical departments with more female full professors have higher NIH funding ranking (R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.14, p < 0.05). In certain subspecialties, female associate and full professors outperform male counterparts. Overall, female authors have higher numbers of more recent citations. Conclusions Subspecialty involvement and academic performance differences by sex vary greatly by subspecialty type and are most pronounced at the assistant professor level. Identification of potential barriers for entry of women into certain subspecialties, causes for the observed lower number of publications/citations among female assistant professors, and obstacles for attaining leadership roles need to be determined. We propose a new metric for assessment of publications/citations that can offset the effects of seniority differences between male and female faculty members.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 American College of Surgeons",2016,/,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,223,2,387EP  - 398.e2,612771927,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2016.03.042,27109779,#797,Valsangkar 2016,"",""

"Distribution of GPs in Scotland by age, gender and deprivation",Blane D.N.; ; McLean G.; Watt G.,"General practice in the UK is widely reported to be in crisis, with particular concerns about recruitment and retention of family doctors. This study assessed the distribution of GPs in Scotland by age, gender and deprivation, using routinely available data.We found that there are more GPs (and fewer patients per GP) in the least deprived deciles than there are in the most deprived deciles. Furthermore, there are a higher proportion of older GPs in the most deprived deciles. There are also important gender differences in the distribution of GPs. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers and practitioners.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2015.",2015,/,Scottish Medical Journal,60,4,214EP  - 219,609155934,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0036933015606592,26403569,#800,Blane 2015,"",""

Protocol and recruitment results from a randomized controlled trial comparing group phone-based versus newsletter interventions for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors,Befort C.A.; ; Klemp J.R.; Fabian C.; Perri M.G.; Sullivan D.K.; Schmitz K.H.; Diaz F.J.; Shireman T.,"Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer recurrence and death. Women who reside in rural areas have higher obesity prevalence and suffer from breast cancer treatment-related disparities compared to urban women. The objective of this 5-year randomized controlled trial is to compare methods for delivering extended care for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors. Group phone-based counseling via conference calls addresses access barriers, is more cost-effective than individual phone counseling, and provides group support which may be ideal for rural breast cancer survivors who are more likely to have unmet support needs. Women (n=210) diagnosed with Stage 0 to III breast cancer in the past 10years who are >=3months out from initial cancer treatments, have a BMI 27-45kg/m<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>, and have physician clearance were enrolled from multiple cancer centers. During Phase I (months 0 to 6), all women receive a behavioral weight loss intervention delivered through group phone sessions. Women who successfully lose 5% of weight enter Phase II (months 6 to 18) and are randomized to one of two extended care arms: continued group phone-based treatment or a mail-based newsletter. During Phase III, no contact is made (months 18 to 24). The primary outcome is weight loss maintenance from 6 to 18months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, serum biomarkers, and cost-effectiveness. This study will provide essential information on how to reach rural survivors in future efforts to establish weight loss support for breast cancer survivors as a standard of care. &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Inc.",2014,/,Contemporary Clinical Trials,37,2,261EP  - 271,372350126,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2014.01.010,24486636,#803,Befort 2014,"",""

Suitability of cancer registries for recruiting patients with low-incidence cancers for supportive care studies,Langbecker D.H.; ; Hunt K.; Yates P.,"Aims: In Australia, state-based cancer registries offer a mechanism for recruiting population-based samples of cancer patients for research; however, the suitability of this method for the recruitment of patients with low-incidence cancers for supportive care studies is unclear. This report describes the process of recruitment of primary brain tumour patients, response rates and sample representativeness. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We aimed to recruit a population-based sample of 40 newly diagnosed brain tumour patients through the Queensland Cancer Registry for a pilot longitudinal study of needs, distress and service utilisation. For eligible patients identified via the registry, consent to contact was sought from patients' treating doctors, and once obtained, patients were invited to participate and consented. The CONSORT flowchart and descriptive statistics were used to describe participant flow through the recruitment process. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 212 adults identified as eligible via the registry, consent to contact was attempted for 203 patients via treating doctors, and obtained for 97 patients (45.8%). Reasons for non-consent to contact (from clinicians) included no response (for 74 patients), refusal (20) and return-tosender (12). Almost half (40; 18.9% of all potentially eligible patients) invited to participate consented and completed baseline data collection. Reasons for patient non-consent included no response (48 patients), refusal (5), death (3) and return-to-sender (1). Comparison of participants and non-participants (based on registry data) showed no significant differences in age at diagnosis, gender, area of residence or tumour characteristics (side, location, lobe, histology or grade). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Patient recruitment was limited primarily by non-response from clinicians, suggesting earlier clinician involvement is needed.
