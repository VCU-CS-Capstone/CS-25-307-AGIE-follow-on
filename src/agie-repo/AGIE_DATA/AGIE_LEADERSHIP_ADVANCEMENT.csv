Misconceptions about women in leadership in academic medicine.,Hastie MJ; Lee A; Siddiqui S; Oakes D; Wong CA,"Despite progress made over the past decade, women are under-represented in positions of leadership in academic medicine. Women physicians face numerous challenges throughout their careers. Despite achieving leadership positions, women in leadership continue to experience the impact of those challenges. In this review, we describe four misconceptions about women in leadership, along with their impact and recommendations. First, we describe differences between mentorship and sponsorship, as well as their impact on attaining leadership positions. Second, the gender pay gap persists throughout women's careers, regardless of leadership positions. Third, we explore the role of self-efficacy in leadership in the context of stereotype threats. Fourth, gendered expectations of leadership characteristics place an undue burden on women, detracting from their leadership effectiveness. Organizations can address the challenges women face by creating robust mentorship and sponsorship networks, establishing transparent and equitable pay policies, promoting and normalizing a broader range of leadership styles, and improving work flexibility and support structure. Ultimately, such changes serve all members of the organization through increased retention and engagement.",2023,Jun,Can J Anaesth,70,6,1019-1025,,10.1007/s12630-023-02458-7,37193865,#4,Hastie 2023,"",""

Women physicians in academic pathology leadership.,Brown MR; Tay C; Jacobs JW; Booth GS,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the gender composition of departmental chairs and program leadership of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited pathology residencies and American Board of Pathology-certified subspecialty fellowships across the United States. METHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis, we examined the gender of individuals holding leadership positions in academic pathology in the United States. Using publicly available online data, 2 authors independently coded perceived gender (ie, man/woman/other) with 100% concordance. RESULTS: In 144 pathology residency programs, more women hold residency program director positions (52.1% [75/144]). Among 11 pathology subspecialties, women overall hold fewer fellowship program director positions (45.0% [212/471]). Among the residency-associated pathology department chair positions identified, women hold fewer positions (31.8% [42/132]). There is some geographic variation in pathology leadership gender composition when stratified using US Census regions. CONCLUSIONS: Women in academic pathology departments are well represented in residency and overall fellowship program leadership but are underrepresented in department chair and certain pathology subspecialty leadership positions. The disproportionate number of women in department chair positions is observed across medical specialties, highlighting the need for improved gender equity among high-level academic medicine positions.",2024,Mar,Am J Clin Pathol,161,3,305-310,,10.1093/ajcp/aqad151,37961931,#6,Brown 2024,"",""
Advancing Women to Leadership Positions Through Individual Actions and Institutional Reform.,Alli A; Lin T; Thorndyke LE; Parekh R; Nunez A,"Women in medicine experience disparities in the workplace and in achieving leadership roles. They face challenges related to climate and culture, equitable compensation, work-life integration, opportunities for professional development and advancement, and occupational and systemic factors that can lead to burnout. Without specific resources to support women's development and advancement and promote conducive workplace climates, efforts to recruit, retain, and promote women physicians into leadership roles may be futile. This article is designed for 2 audiences: women physicians of all career stages, who are exploring factors that may adversely impact their advancement opportunities, and leaders in academic medicine and health care, who seek to achieve inclusive excellence by fully engaging talent. The need for greater representation of women leaders in medicine is both a moral and a business imperative that requires systemic changes. Individuals and institutional leaders can apply the practical strategies and solutions presented to catalyze successful recruitment, retention, and promotion of women leaders and widespread institutional reform.",2021,Sep,Pediatrics,148,Suppl 2,,,10.1542/peds.2021-051440D,34470879,#7,Alli 2021,"",""
Here to chair: Gender differences in the path to leadership.,Sethuraman KN; Lin M; Rounds K; Fang A; Lall MD; Parsons M; Linden JA; Gursahani K; Raukar N; Perman SM; Dobiesz VA,"OBJECTIVE: Career paths leading to department chair positions are elusive. Women represent only 11% of academic emergency department (ED) chairs. It is unclear whether the pathway to chair is different for men and women; the characteristics, achievements, and qualifications among those who become ED chairs is unknown. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of curriculum vitae (CV) of current ED chairs in departments with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited residency programs. Former women chairs were included due to paucity of current women chairs. Statistics were calculated using bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 163 eligible chairs, 88 CV (54%) were obtained, including six former women chairs. A majority (86.4%) self-identified as White/Caucasian, 21.5% were women, 46% were chief residents, 28.4% completed additional postgraduate degrees, and 21.8% were fellowship trained. At time of chair appointment, 58% were professor rank, 53.5% held ED operations roles, and 32% served as vice chair. Women were more likely to be in educational (53% vs. 22%) versus operational (26% vs. 61%, p = 0.02) roles. Women obtained more advanced degrees (47% vs. 25%, p = 0.02), were awarded more nonfederal grants (median = 7 vs. 3, p = 0.04), and achieved more national committee leadership (median = 4 vs. 1, p = 0.02). There were no gender differences in fellowship training, awards, leadership training programs, publications, federal grants, or national/international lectures after adjusting for years in practice. CONCLUSION: While the majority of chairs held prior leadership roles in ED operations, only one in five women chairs did, suggesting gender differences in the path to chair attainment. These differences in paths may contribute to persistent gender disparities in ED chairs and may be influenced by career path choices, implicit bias, and structural barriers.",2021,Sep,Acad Emerg Med,28,9,993-1000,,10.1111/acem.14221,33511736,#8,Sethuraman 2021,"",""
Education Research: Diversity in Neurology Graduate Medical Education Leadership.,Jordan MC; Tchopev ZN; McClean JC 2nd,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the current landscape of gender and racial diversity among adult neurology residency and fellowship program directors (PDs). Diversity in medicine affects the quality of care provided to a diverse patient population. There are efforts in nearly every field of medicine to increase the diversity of the physician workforce. While there has been improvement in some of the known disparities in medicine such as gender disparities, these disparities have persisted in more senior academic positions in medicine. METHODS: A data set was generated by the Association of American Medical Colleges for the purpose of this study using a variety of sources. The data included deidentified, person-level variables, including self-reported gender, race, or ethnicity, and the type of program for all PDs of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited residencies and fellowships. This retrospective descriptive survey study sought to (1) describe the current gender and race climate of neurology PDs and (2) identify groups that may be disproportionally underrepresented in these positions compared with those in other specialties and levels of medical training. Descriptive statistics and tests of nonrandom association were performed to address the objectives. RESULTS: We found that 56.7% of residency PDs and 58% of fellowship PDs are male. The male to female ratio of PDs was similar to current neurology residents who are 53.4% male. There were significantly more female medical students (51.5%) compared with all other categories of academic rank other than neurology residency PDs (41.1%). Only 4.3% of residency PDs were Black and only 3.7% were Hispanic. There were no Black fellowship PDs, and 5.1% were Hispanic. There were significantly more non-White medical students and trainees compared with each PD group. The breakdown of gender and ethnic diversity of neurology PDs was similar to that of PDs from all residencies and fellowships. DISCUSSION: While there are many barriers to achieving diversity in medicine, program leadership in graduate medical education may be one of them. This report describes the current landscape of diversity among PDs of residency and fellowship programs in the United States. This study shows one snapshot in time, which can be used as a baseline during this era of change.",2023,Jun,Neurol Educ,2,2,e200060,,10.1212/NE9.0000000000200060,39410945,#9,Jordan 2023,"",""
Race and Gender Disparities Among Leadership in Academic Family Medicine.,Adetoye M; Gold K,"As the United States moves closer to a majority-minority, and a nearly equal male to female population, we should see a similar shift in the composition of leadership in the workplace. Family Medicine, while attempting to close the gaps, continues to fall short in producing women and minority leaders. METHODS: The demographic traits of Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM) chairs in medical education institutions in the United States and Canada were analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of those in chair positions were male (67%) and White (53%) non-Hispanic. Male chairs have been in positions significantly longer than females (average 9 years and 6 years, respectively). There was also a significant difference between chairs in public versus private schools-public, that is, chairs at public institutions had a much longer average time of 9 years in current position compared with those in private institutions had an average of 5 years. While the comparison was not significant, 46% of those that self-reported as non-White held chair positions at private schools compared with 28% of those that self-reported as White. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of leadership pathways, women and underrepresented minorities continue to be underrepresented in these positions. Future research would benefit from a more extensive evaluation of different characteristics such as disability, gender identity and sexual orientation.",2022,Sep,J Am Board Fam Med,,,,,10.3122/jabfm.2022.AP.220122,36096662,#10,Adetoye 2022,"",""
"Racial, Ethnic, and Sex Diversity in Academic Medical Leadership.",Meadows AM; Skinner MM; Hazime AA; Day RG; Fore JA; Day CS,"IMPORTANCE: For the past 50 years, significant gaps have existed in gender and racial diversity across various medical specialties, despite the many benefits of a diverse physician workforce. One proposed approach to increasing diversity is top-down diversification, in which diverse leadership results in increased minority and female workforce representation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in academic medical leadership diversity from 2007 to 2019 and to assess the recent leadership diversity of various specialties compared with the averages across all specialties. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of physicians in varying academic roles in 2007, 2019, and 2020. Demographic data were collected via specialized reports from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Included were 4 primary care specialties (internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology [OB/GYN] and 4 surgical specialties (orthopedic surgery, neurologic surgery, otolaryngology [ENT], general surgery). Study participants were faculty, program directors, and chairpersons. Data were analyzed for the years 2007, 2019, and 2020. INTERVENTION: Self-reporting of demographic information to residency programs collected via the Graduate Medical Education Track Survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportions of each race/ethnicity and sex among cohorts of participants and comparisons between them. RESULTS: The total number of individuals investigated included 186 210 faculty from 2019 (79 441 female [42.7%]), 6417 program directors from 2020 (2392 female [37.3%]), 1016 chairpersons from 2007 (89 female [8.8%]), and 2424 chairpersons from 2019 (435 female [17.9%]). When comparing chairperson diversity from 2007 to 2019, only internal medicine and general surgery experienced significant increases in minority (aggregate category used throughout the investigation to refer to anyone who self-identified as anything other than non-Hispanic White) representation (90% increase [11.7 percentage points, from 13.0% in 2007 to 24.7% in 2019]; P = .01 and 96% increase [13.0 percentage points, from 13.5% in 2007 to 26.5% in 2019]; P < .001), respectively; meanwhile, several specialties saw significant increases in female representation during this period (family medicine by 107.4%, P =.002; pediatrics by 83.1%, P =.006; OB/GYN by 53.2%, P =.045; orthopedic surgery by +4.1 percentage points, P =.04; general surgery by 226.9%, P =.005). In general, surgical specialties had lower leadership diversity than the average diversity of all residency programs, whereas primary care specialties had similar or increased diversity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study results suggest that some specialties have made significant contributions toward bridging diversity gaps whereas others continue to lag behind. Our recommendations to improve academic medical leadership diversity include programs and institutions (1) publishing efforts and outcomes of diversity representation, (2) incorporating a representative demographic for leadership selection committees, and (3) actively promoting the importance of diversity throughout the selection process.",2023,Sep,JAMA Netw Open,6,9,e2335529,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.35529,37747731,#11,Meadows 2023,"",""
Women Neurosurgeons in Academic and Other Leadership Positions in the United States.,Feng R; Hoffman SE; Wagner K; Ullman JS; Stippler M; Germano IM,"OBJECTIVE: To provide the status of women neurosurgeons (WNS) in academic faculty and/or leadership positions in neurosurgery in the United States. METHODS: Neurosurgery academic programs were defined as having an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) neurosurgery residency program (NSRP). Using a Google search, gender, academic rank, postgraduate degrees, academic and clinical titles, and subspecialty were recorded for each neurosurgery faculty. Officer gender was recorded for the top 7 neurosurgery U.S. organizations, 7 subspecialty sections, and 50 state neurosurgical societies. RESULTS: WNS were faculty at 77% (89/115) of ACGME NSRPs and constituted 10% of the workforce (186/1773). WNS residents were in 92% of ACGME NSRPs and constituted 19% of the workforce (293/1515). Two NSRPs (8%) had neither WNS faculty nor WNS residents. Of NSRPs without WNS faculty, 52% (13/25) had a faculty size >10. WNS accounted for 3% of NSRP chair positions. Academic rank of WNS faculty was lower than academic rank of men neurosurgeons faculty (P < 0.05). WNS faculty had a higher number of postgraduate degrees (P < 0.05). Pediatrics was the most common subspecialty (30%) among WNS. Over time, WNS held 1% of the leadership positions within the top 7 U.S. neurosurgery organizations and 7% within the 7 subspecialty sections. Over the past 20 years, 28% (14/50) of U.S. state neurosurgical societies had WNS serve as president. CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, the gender gap for U.S. WNS faculty and residents still exists.

Leadership Programs for Academic Women: Building Self-Efficacy and Organizational Leadership Capacity.,Ford AY; Dannels S; Morahan P; Magrane D,"Background: Although numerous programs have evolved to develop leadership skills in women, few have conducted rigorous longitudinal evaluation of program outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation study is to measure the continuing impact of the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM(®)) program in its third decade of operation and to compare outcomes for graduates across the two programs (ELAM and Executive Leadership in Academic Technology, Engineering and Science [ELATES at Drexel(®)]), using a revised Leadership Learning and Career Development (LLCD) Survey. Methods: The LLCD survey was administered to program graduates between 2013 and 2016 upon entry, immediately after graduation, and 2 years after program completion. Two-way mixed effects analysis of variances were used to analyze differences between programs and changes over time. Descriptive statistics and narrative responses were analyzed for trends and themes. Results: Of 287 graduates, 69% responded to all three survey administrations. Respondents rated competencies in strategic finance, organizational dynamics, communities of leadership practice, and personal and professional leadership development as highly important at all points of measurement. Ratings of ability to conduct the selected competencies (i.e., self-efficacy), increased during the program and were maintained over the 2 years that followed. Applications and offers for leadership positions increased over the course of the program and the subsequent 2 years. Respondents showed a strong preference for serving the institution that both sponsored their participation in the leadership program development and supported their continuing contributions to the institution. Personal development goals became more elaborated, institutionally focused, and strategic.

METHODS: Successive cross-sectional observational study of six years (2015 to 2020) of data from the Academy of Administrators/Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine- Benchmark Survey. Primary analyses focused on gender/URiM differences in leadership roles and academic rank. Secondary analysis focused on disparities during the first 10 years of practice.

Salary disparities based on gender in academic emergency medicine leadership.,Wiler JL; Wendel SK; Rounds K; McGowan B; Baird J,"OBJECTIVE: There are significantly fewer women than men in leadership roles in health care. Previous studies have shown that, overall, male physicians earn nearly $20,000 more annually than their female physician colleagues after adjusting for confounding factors. However, there has not been a description of physician leadership compensation in relation to gender. METHODS: This was a successive cross-sectional observation study design of 154 emergency departments in the United States from 5 years (2013, 2015-2018) using Association of Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine and Academy of Administrators in Academic EM survey data. The primary variable of interest, leadership role, was attained by recoding the survey responses to assign primary job duty into four main categories: no leadership role, operations leadership, education leadership, and executive leadership. RESULTS: Overall, 8820 responses were included. Across all survey years, the mean (±SD) percentage of women in any leadership role was significantly less than men (44.5% [95% CI: 42.8, 46.2%] vs. 55.3% [95% CI: 54.1, 56.5%]). Women in leadership roles worked more clinical hours than men in the same position (female median = 1008, male median = 960).

Differences were tested with the chi-square test and t -test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with holding leadership positions and experiencing impostor syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 2,183 attending and retired physicians were included in the analytic cohort; 1,471 (67.4%) were in leadership roles and 712 (32.6%) were not. After adjustment, male physicians were more likely than women to hold leadership positions (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.69; p < 0.001). Non-US citizens (permanent resident or visa holder) were less likely to hold leadership positions than US citizens (odds ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.55; p < 0.001). Having a leadership position was associated with lower odds of impostor syndrome (odds ratio 0.54; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.68; p < 0.001). Female surgeons were more likely to report impostor syndrome compared to male surgeons (90.0% vs 67.7%; p < 0.001), an association that persisted even when female surgeons held leadership roles. Similar trends were appreciated for female and male nonsurgeons. Impostor syndrome rates did not differ by race and ethnicity, including among those underrepresented in medicine, even after adjustment for gender and leadership role.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and updated global analysis of female representation in leadership positions within orthopaedic sports medicine and arthroscopy societies throughout the world. METHODS: Publicly available websites for orthopaedic sports medicine societies throughout the world were evaluated. For societies that met inclusion criteria, the following data were collected: types of leadership positions available and breakdown of male and female orthopaedic surgeons in those positions. RESULTS: There were a total of 55 societies analyzed from North America (5, 9.1%), South America (8, 14.5%), Europe (18, 32.7%), Asia (13, 23.6%), Africa (2, 3.6%), the Middle East (3, 5.5%) and Australia (3, 5.5%), as well as 3 international societies (5.5%). North America had the highest percentage of women in leadership positions with 19 of 97 positions (19.6%), followed by international societies with 11 of 92 (12.0%) positions filled by women. The Middle East and Australia had the fewest number of women, with all-male leadership. Globally, female orthopaedic surgeons served in 11 of 181 (6.1%) board of directors positions, 16 of 192 (8.3%) executive committees positions, 17 of 143 (11.9%) committee chair positions, 2 of 18 (11.1%) officer positions, 1 of 12 (8.3%) council positions, and 2 of 7 (28.6%) spokesperson positions. CONCLUSION: While some countries have higher representation than others, the number of women in leadership positions in orthopaedic sports medicine societies throughout the world is significantly less than their male counterparts. While this is a preliminary analysis, future studies should aim to evaluate these trends over time. Providing equitable opportunities for women to rise into high-ranking positions in orthopaedic sports medicine may contribute to the interest of women and other minorities in the field of sports medicine and help improve diversity.

Diversity of physicians in leadership and academic positions in Alberta: a cross-sectional survey.,Ruzycki SM; Roach P; Ahmed SB; Barnabe C; Holroyd-Leduc J,"BACKGROUND: Efforts to reduce barriers and disparities faced by marginalised physicians are limited by a lack of data on the current diversity of the Canadian physician workforce. We aimed to characterise the diversity of the Albertan physician workforce. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey, open to all Albertan physicians from 1 September 2020 to 6 October 2021, measured the proportion of physicians from traditionally under-represented groups, including those with diverse gender identities, disabilities and from racial minorities. RESULTS: There were 1087 respondents (9.3% response rate); of whom 33.4% identified as cisgender men (n=363), 46.8% as cisgender women (n=509) and less than 3% as gender diverse. Fewer than 5% were members of the LGBTQI2S+community. Half were white (n=547), 4.6% were black (n=50) and fewer than 3% were Indigenous or Latinx. Over one-third reported a disability (n=368, 33.9%). There were 303 white cisgender women (27.9%), 189 white cisgender men (17.4%), 136 black, Indigenous or person of colour (BIPOC) cisgender men (12.5%) and 151 BIPOC cisgender women (13.9%). Compared with BIPOC physicians, white participants were over-represented in leadership positions (64.2% and 32.1%; p=0.06) and academic roles (78.7% and 66.9%; p<0.01). Cisgender women had less often applied for academic promotion than cisgender men (85.4% and 78.3%, respectively, p=0.01), and BIPOC physicians had been denied promotion more frequently (7.7% compared with 4.4%; p=0.47). CONCLUSION: Many Albertan physicians may experience marginalisation through at least one protected characteristic. There were race-based and gender-based differences in experiences of medical leadership and academic promotion which may explain observed disparities in these positions. To increase diversity and representation in medicine, medical organisations should focus on inclusive cultures and environments. Universities should focus efforts on supporting BIPOC physicians, especially BIPOC cisgender women, in applying for promotion.",2022,Dec,BMJ Lead,6,4,278-285,,10.1136/leader-2021-000554,36794601,#21,Ruzycki 2022,"",""
Gender Diversity in Hand Surgery Leadership.,Brisbin AK; Chen W; Goldschmidt E; Smith BT; Bourne DA,"BACKGROUND: Diversity in leadership drives innovation; however, women are underrepresented in leadership positions across academic medicine. The aim of this study was to assess the current gender representation in hand surgery leadership positions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of leaders in hand surgery. Leaders were defined as President, Board and Committee members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and the American Association for Hand Surgery, as well as hand surgery fellowship program directors and physician lead editors of peer-reviewed hand journals. The representation of women in leadership was compared to the percentage of female hand fellows over the same period. Years in practice, academic rank, additional degrees, h-index, m-index, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, publications, and citations were compared between male and female leaders. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 213 leadership positions (13.6%) are held by women which is fewer than would be expected based on hand surgery fellowship composition. Female leaders were earlier in practice than their male counterparts (13.5 ± 5.7 versus 20.8 ± 11.1 years, P < .01). Women were more likely to hold position of assistant professor and less likely to be full professors (P < .05). There was no gender difference in NIH funding, h-index, m-index, publications, or citations.

Assessment of Gender Parity: Leadership Representation in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.,Olson EM; Kennedy CC; Kelm DJ,"Background: Academic centers' and professional societies' top leadership representation and professional societies' award recipients remain disparate by gender in many fields. Little is known regarding leadership representation and recognition within pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine (PCCM), which has ∼22% women physicians. We sought to understand the landscape of female PCCM leaders. Methods: We abstracted gender of fellowship program directors (PDs), Department of Medicine (DOM) Chairs and Division Chiefs from academic medical centers with PCCM fellowship programs from 2018 and for comparison 2008. We abstracted leadership and recognition award recipients within four PCCM professional societies from 2013 to 2018 (American Thoracic Society [ATS], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM], American College of Chest Physicians [CHEST], and Society of Critical Care Medicine [SCCM]). Results: In 2018, 29% of PCCM PD, 15% of PCCM Division Chiefs, and 15% of DOM Chairs were women. There were significantly more female PDs in 2018 (29%) compared with 2008 (16%, p = 0.04). On average, 25% of society presidents were women, with 28% of PCCM societal awards going to women, with significant difference between societies (p = 0.04). Each society differed in average distribution of female board members over the 6-year period: ATS 38%, AASM 35%, CHEST 18%, and SCCM 44% (p < 0.001). Conclusion: PCCM leadership and societal recognition are disparate by gender with few women holding top leadership roles and receiving societal recognition.

Gender distribution and NIH funding rank in dermatology leadership: a cross-sectional analysis.,Viveiros MD; Awethe Z; Kaffenberger J,"In examining the influence of National Institute of Health (NIH) funding on gender distribution within dermatology leadership roles, a cross-sectional analysis of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited dermatology residencies was conducted. The gender of leadership faculty was verified using online resources, while institutions were categorized by their 2022 NIH dermatology funding status. Results revealed that male dermatologists predominantly occupied department chair roles, whereas female dermatologists were more frequently found in associate program director roles, regardless of funding status. Notably, women held most program director positions in the top NIH-funded group, though this difference was not statistically significant due to a smaller sample size. The overall gender distribution has shown progress from 2021, with a significant rise in female associate program directors and a narrowing gender gap for chairs and program directors. Despite NIH funding rank playing a minimal role in gender distribution, our study underscores positive strides towards gender equality in dermatology leadership.

Gender Differences in Experiences of Leadership Emergence Among Emergency Medicine Department Chairs.,Hobgood C; Draucker C,"IMPORTANCE: The number of women entering medicine continues to increase, but women remain underrepresented at all tiers of academic rank and chair leadership in EM. The proportion of female chairs in EM has not exceeded 12% in 2 decades. OBJECTIVE: To compare how male and female EM chairs experience leadership emergence, with attention to factors associated with support of the emergence of female chairs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative descriptive study was conducted between April 2020 and February 2021 at 36 US academic EM departments. Eligible participants were all current and emeritus female EM academic department chairs (with a possible cohort of 20 individuals) and an equal number of randomly selected male chairs. INTERVENTIONS: Semistructured interviews were conducted via teleconferencing with an 11-item interview guide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Qualitative findings identifying similarities and gender differences in leadership emergence were collected. RESULTS: Among 20 female chairs in EM, 19 women (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [7.1] years) participated in the study (95.0% response rate). There were 13 active chairs, and 6 women were within 5 years of chair leadership. Among 77 male chairs in EM identified and randomized, 37 men were invited to participate, among whom 19 individuals (51.4%) agreed to participate; 18 men (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [7.5] years) completed their interviews. Reflecting upon their experiences of leadership emergence, male chairs saw leadership as their destiny, were motivated to be chairs to gain influence, were dismissive of risks associated with chairing a department, and were sponsored by senior male leaders to advance in leadership. Female chairs saw leadership as something they had long prepared for, were motivated to be chairs to make a difference, were cautious of risks associated with chairing a department that could derail their careers, and relied on their own efforts to advance in leadership. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that experiences of leadership emergence differed by gender. These results suggest that leadership development strategies tailored to women should promote early internalization of leadership identity, tightly link leadership to purpose, cultivate active sponsorship, and encourage women's risk tolerance through leadership validation to support women's development as leaders and demonstrate a commitment to gender equity in EM leadership.",2022,Mar,JAMA Netw Open,5,3,e221860,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.1860,35267032,#25,Hobgood 2022,"",""
Female Leadership in Academic Plastic Surgery: A Comprehensive Analysis.,Moeller E; Riesel J; Boms O; Pompermaier L; Pusic A; Corlew S,"BACKGROUND: Gender equity remains to be realized in academic plastic and reconstructive surgery. The purpose of this study was to measure the proportion of women in leadership roles in academic plastic and reconstructive surgery to verify where gender gaps may persist. METHODS: Six markers of leadership were analyzed: academic faculty rank, manuscript authorship, program directorship, journal editor-in-chief positions, society board of directors membership, and professional society membership. Descriptive statistics were performed, and chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables. RESULTS: About 16 percent to 19 percent of practicing plastic surgeons are female, as measured by the percentage of female faculty and American Society of Plastic Surgeons members. Female plastic surgeons comprised 18.9 percent (n = 178) of the faculty from 88 academic plastic surgery institutions, and represented 9.9 percent of full professors and 10.8 percent of chiefs. Nineteen institutions had no female faculty. Women were first authors in 23.4 percent of publications and senior author in 14.7 percent of publications. No journal studied had a female editor-in-chief. Of the examined plastic and reconstructive societies, the proportion of women on the board of directors ranged from 16.7 percent to 23.5 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of female program directors, first manuscript authors, and board members of certain societies is commensurate with the number of women in the field, suggesting an evolving landscape within the specialty.

The goal was to contribute to the creation of equitable work environments for women physicians. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the pilot implementation of WEL. METHODS: Participants included a diverse group of 18 early career to midcareer women physicians from across medical specialties, 3 from each partner organization. WEL was developed as an 18-month program with 3 series focused on wellness, equity, and leadership and included monthly virtual and in-person meetings. After institutional board review approval, a mixed-methods evaluation design was incorporated, which included postseries and postprogram surveys and in-depth telephone interviews. RESULTS: Participants delineated several drivers of program success, including peer support and/or networks; interconnectedness between the topics of wellness, equity, and leadership; and diversity of participants and faculty. Areas for improvement included more opportunities to connect with peers and share progress and more structured mentorship. Regarding program impact, participants reported increased knowledge and behavior change because of their participation.

Gender Parity in Academic Leadership Roles at AOSSM Annual Meetings.,Potter JS; Ranpura A; Rynecki ND; Beebe KS; Galdi B,"BACKGROUND: Ever since orthopaedic surgery was cited as the specialty with the lowest percentage of women, research has geared toward better understanding where lapses occur and ensured that equitable opportunities exist within the field. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To analyze the 5-year trend in the academic leadership roles of female versus male orthopaedic surgeons at the AOSSM Annual Meeting. We hypothesized that a nationally representative proportion of female surgeons would hold academic leadership positions and that this figure would increase during the study period. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Publicly available AOSSM Annual Meeting brochures from 2015 to 2019 were analyzed. Moderators and course instructors with doctor of medicine (MD) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) degrees were included. Gender-neutral names were researched as needed for gender clarification. The gender composition of total moderators and total course instructors was calculated and trended over the 5-year period. Statistics from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 2017, the median of the study period, were used for comparison with total active sports medicine orthopaedic surgeons. RESULTS: Women represented 5.9% of moderators and course instructors at the AOSSM Annual Meeting from 2015 to 2019. The percentage of female moderators increased from 6.0% in 2015 to 8.6% in 2019, and the percentage of female course instructors increased from 3.4% in 2015 to 5.6% in 2019. After adjusting for dual contributions by a single woman to both roles, we found that 6.7% of total moderators and course instructors over the 5-year study period were women (6.3% in 2015, 7.7% in 2019). This was close to the 6.6% rate of female sports orthopaedic surgeons reported by the AAMC in 2017. CONCLUSION: Using moderator and instructor involvement at the AAOSM Annual Meetings as a proxy for involvement in academia, we found evidence to support gender parity in the orthopaedic subspecialty of sports medicine.

Leadership Experiences of Internal Medicine Residents: A Needs Assessment for Leadership Curricula.,Lyons MD; Oyler J; Iossi K; Merriam S,"PURPOSE: Leadership development during medical training is critical. Accrediting bodies strongly recommend and residents desire leadership training. However, limited needs assessment data exist regarding trainee perceptions of and experiences with leadership training. Our objective is to describe residents' perceptions of leadership and desires for leadership training with the goal of informing effective curricular development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2019 a trained qualitative interviewer conducted semi-structured interviews with volunteer second-year categorical internal medicine residents recruited via email across four institutions. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded by two independent coders. After adjudicating discrepancies, coders synthesized codes into broader themes. Final thematic analysis was triangulated with the entire author group. RESULTS: Fourteen residents were interviewed (50% female). Few reported prior leadership training. Thematic analysis yielded six main themes. First, residents perceive ""leadership"" to be related to formal, assigned, hierarchical roles. Second, residents identify their own leadership primarily in the inpatient clinical setting. Third, residents identify clinical competence, emotional intelligence, and communication as important skills for effective leadership. Fourth, residents struggle to identify where leadership is currently being taught. Fifth, residents desire additional leadership development. Finally, residents prefer well-labeled, interactive methods for leadership development. CONCLUSION: Although residents desire leadership development, these skills are not often explicitly taught, labeled, or assessed. Curriculum developers may consider explicitly contextualizing leadership training within an ""everyday leadership"" framework, dovetailing leadership coaching with daily teaching workflow and feedback structures, and implementing faculty development initiatives to allow for appropriate feedback and assessment of these skills.",2022,,J Healthc Leadersh,14,,155-161,,10.2147/JHL.S376089,36168427,#31,Lyons 2022,"",""

While prior study has established women publish less than men, many evaluations are limited to individual specialties and do not evaluate involvement with educational activities. OBJECTIVE: To compare gender differences in academic output, intramural leadership positions, and educational leadership positions of academic physicians. METHODS: The curriculum vitae and de-identified demographic data of all permanent physicians employed at a multi-site academic medical center were reviewed from April to May 2020. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regressions evaluated leadership positions and number of publications. RESULTS: Of 3,359 physicians in the demographic database, 32.3% (n = 1,087) were women and 72.5% were white (n = 2,510).

Women in Leadership: Why So Few and What to Do About It.,Surawicz CM,"The numbers of women in medical school and in medical training have increased dramatically and are near 50% overall, but the number of women who advance to senior and leadership positions is not nearly this high. There are many reasons why the number of women in leadership roles in academic medicine has not kept pace with the number of women entering the field of medicine. Two popular themes are the glass ceiling (referring to an invisible barrier to advancement) and the leaky pipeline (the loss of women faculty along the path, or pipeline, to advancement). I believe that both come into play. Glass ceiling issues tend to be of two types: those related to the institutional culture and those related to problems of bias, especially unconscious bias. Leaky pipeline issues include the challenges of work-life integration and the need for leadership development for women. There are solutions to all of these challenges.

"The role of gender in academic productivity, impact, and leadership among academic spine surgeons.",Agaronnik N; Xiong GX; Uzosike A; Crawford AM; Lightsey HM 4th; Simpson AK; Schoenfeld AJ,"BACKGROUND/CONTEXT: Women represent a small minority of practicing orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, with spine surgery having a disproportionately low representation relative to other subspecialties. Previous efforts have attempted to characterize gender patterns in authorship amongst select spine journals. However, no study to our knowledge has done a comprehensive assessment of the influence of gender on academic productivity, impact, and leadership amongst academic spine faculty. PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of gender on academic productivity, promotion to leadership positions, and career advancement among academic spine faculty in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Academic spine faculty associated with orthopedic residency, North American Spine Society spine fellowship programs, and American Association of Neurological Surgeons spine fellowship programs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Academic productivity as measured by publications counts, h-index, authorship ranking as well as academic rank and leadership roles METHODS: We identified all spine faculty across orthopedic residency, orthopedic spine fellowship, and neurosurgical spine fellowship programs in the United States, and abstracted academic performance characteristics, cumulative h-index, and complete publication records for each individual faculty member. Proportions of men and women by specialty, academic rank, and leadership were compared with Fisher's exact testing, and comparison of mean h-index and publication counts compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. Adjusted analyses on publication count and h-index were achieved with poisson regression analysis with gender as the primary predictor adjusting for specialty, degrees, academic rank, and seniority based on time since fellowship completion. RESULTS: The representation of women among spine faculty associated with orthopedic residency and North American Spine Society spine fellowship programs was 5.6%. On average, women had 40% fewer total publications (p=.025), h-indices approximately 5 units lower than men (p=.006), 40% fewer total high-impact publications (p=.030), half the senior author publications (p=.005), and half the high-impact senior author publications (p=.007) compared to men. After adjusting for seniority and academic rank, the number of publications in high impact journals no longer differed between men and women, although differences persisted for total publication count and the h-index. Men were significantly more likely to occupy higher academic ranks, with 25.6% of men and 9.5% of women holding the rank of full professor (p=.031), although there was no significant difference in the rate of appointment to leadership positions. Similar findings were encountered among American Association of Neurological Surgeons spine fellowship faculty. CONCLUSIONS: The present study details the low rate of women in academic spine surgery. Furthermore, gender disparities exist in publication volume, impact, and h-indices. A much lower proportion of women hold higher-ranking academic positions compared to men, though appointment to leadership positions was similar between genders. Differences in seniority and publication metrics may in part be due to the relatively younger cohort of women faculty. These findings underscore the need for active investment in diversity and pipeline efforts that facilitate recruitment and support academic productivity of women in spine surgery.",2022,May,Spine J,22,5,716-722,,10.1016/j.spinee.2021.12.003,34902588,#38,Agaronnik 2022,"",""

"GRIT: Women in Medicine Leadership Conference Participants' Perceptions of Gender Discrimination, Disparity, and Mitigation.",Harris CE; Clark SD; Chesak SS; Khalsa TK; Salinas M; Pearson ACS; Williams AW; Moeschler SM; Bhagra A,"OBJECTIVE: To assess demographic characteristics and perceptions of female physicians in attendance at a medical conference for women with content focused on growth, resilience, inspiration, and tenacity to better understand major barriers women in medicine face and to find solutions to these barriers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Likert survey was administered to female physicians attending the conference (September 20 to 22, 2018). The survey consisted of demographic data and 4 dimensions that are conducive to women's success in academic medicine: equal access, work-life balance, freedom from gender biases, and supportive leadership. RESULTS: All of the 228 female physicians surveyed during the conference completed the surveys. There were 70 participants (31.5%) who were in practice for less than 10 years (early career), 111 (50%) who were in practice for 11 to 20 years (midcareer), and 41 (18.5%) who had more than 20 years of practice (late career). Whereas participants reported positive support from their supervisors (mean, 0.4 [SD 0.9]; P<.001), they did not report support in the dimensions of work-life balance (mean, -0.2 [SD 0.8]; P<.001) and freedom from gender bias (mean, -0.3 [SD 0.9]; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Female physicians were less likely to feel support for work-life balance and did not report freedom from gender bias in comparison to other dimensions of support.

Gender trends in dentistry: Dental faculty and academic leadership.,Kim A; Karra N; Song C; Linder PJ; Bonino F; Doig P; Zandona A,"OBJECTIVES: Gender equality in the healthcare workforce has been a topic of discourse for many decades. In dental academia, women's representation of enrolled students and faculty has risen consistently since the 1980s. However, women in faculty leadership positions may still be lagging when compared to men. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of women who occupy the upper echelons of academic rank and title by analyzing cross-referenced data from the American Dental Association and the American Dental Education Association on women dental school graduates in relation to academic appointments. METHODS: Gender distribution in rank, title, and appointments in the decade from 2011 to 2019, as well as percentage of women graduates over the same period, were collected for descriptive statistics. Multiple linear regression analysis, Cochran Armitage, and chi-square tests were conducted to examine trends over the years and to determine significant differences in overall percentages (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The total women faculty percentages ranged from 36% to 40%. While the lower-level rank of instructor retained a higher representation of women (56%-65%), the higher rank of professor had disproportionately lower women percentages (18%-26%). Graduates, full-time faculty, lower-level academic ranks, and higher-level academic ranks for women followed similar upward trends that were statistically significant (p < 0.05). When comparing the different groups against each other, the annual increase in women DMD/DDS graduate percentage was higher than women full-time faculty (0.28%), instructor rank (0.92%), professor rank (0.50%), and department chair appointments (0.49%).

Where Are We in Bridging the Gender Leadership Gap in Academic Medicine?,Valantine HA,"In nearly all walks of life, leadership sets the tone for what gets done, who does it, and how it is achieved. In 2020, the top ranks of academic medicine have not yet attained gender parity-an aspirational goal set 7 years ago in this journal as ""50:50 by 2020,"" and a vital aim for the United States' productivity and innovation as a leader in biomedical research. Parity in academic leadership for women and other groups underrepresented in science and medicine will seed the culture change necessary for inclusive excellence: environments in which individuals from all backgrounds thrive in their pursuit of new knowledge to benefit human health.In this Invited Commentary, the author describes the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) current system-wide framework and tools for creating cultures of inclusive excellence through a set of guiding principles and integrated strategies. Successful efforts will recognize that individually focused solutions are necessary but not sufficient for institutional culture change. In keeping with a systems approach are implementing accountability and transparency; establishing clear metrics of inclusion, diversity, and equity; tracking and evaluating such metrics; as well as tying these metrics to institutional reward systems. These essential steps to institutional culture transformation require strong partnerships between NIH and the academic community.

Women remain underrepresented in leadership positions in academic gastroenterology throughout the United States.,Jamorabo DS; Chen R; Gurm H; Jahangir M; Briggs WM; Mohanty SR; Renelus BD,"BACKGROUND: Publication history is a key factor in securing academic promotion, but historical underrepresentation of women in gastroenterology may be an ongoing obstacle to achieving gender parity in leadership positions. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study of gastroenterology programs in the United States, with data including faculty and trainee names, leadership positions, Hirsch indices, and year of first gastroenterology certification gathered from 1 February 2020 to 1 March 2020. Our outcomes of interest were: 1) sex representation in various leadership positions in academic gastroenterology departments; and 2) mean difference in Hirsch indices between men and women, for which we used univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Our cohort included 3655 faculty members and trainees across 163 academic gastroenterology programs in the United States. Women comprised 28.7% (1049/3655) of the cohort, including 713/2657 (26.8%) of faculty and 56/289 (19.4%) of all fellowship program directors and divisional/departmental chairs and chiefs.

METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study that uses public information accessed through the internet via journals' and academic societies' public websites. The medical journals are selected and included according to their h5-index in the field of neurology and neurosurgery. We evaluated the gender composition of the editorial boards and academic societies' leadership positions. RESULTS: The female editorial board member ratio was 44.0% in the top 10 neurology journals. However, this ratio was significantly decreased to 29.7% in the other journals(P < 0.001). The top 10 neurosurgery journals had a female editorial board member ratio of 13.7%. This ratio was significantly decreased to 5.3% in the other 10 journals with lower h5-index(P < 0.001).

Evaluation of two longitudinal faculty leadership training programs: behavioral change and institutional impact.,Mayowski CA; Norman MK; Proulx CN; Hamm ME; Martin MK; Zellers DF; Rubio DM; Levine AS,"PURPOSE: Building leadership skills among faculty in academic medicine is essential, yet professional development programs focused on leadership are not always attentive to the needs of faculty on diverse career pathways or at differing career stages-nor are they often rigorously assessed. Evaluations commonly focus on participant satisfaction and short-term learning but not behavior change and institutional impact, which are difficult to assess but arguably more meaningful.

Reducing Implicit Gender Leadership Bias in Academic Medicine With an Educational Intervention.,Girod S; Fassiotto M; Grewal D; Ku MC; Sriram N; Nosek BA; Valantine H,"PURPOSE: One challenge academic health centers face is to advance female faculty to leadership positions and retain them there in numbers equal to men, especially given the equal representation of women and men among graduates of medicine and biological sciences over the last 10 years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the explicit and implicit biases favoring men as leaders, among both men and women faculty, and to assess whether these attitudes change following an educational intervention. METHOD: The authors used a standardized, 20-minute educational intervention to educate faculty about implicit biases and strategies for overcoming them. Next, they assessed the effect of this intervention. From March 2012 through April 2013, 281 faculty members participated in the intervention across 13 of 18 clinical departments. RESULTS: The study assessed faculty members' perceptions of bias as well as their explicit and implicit attitudes toward gender and leadership. Results indicated that the intervention significantly changed all faculty members' perceptions of bias (P < .05 across all eight measures). Although, as expected, explicit biases did not change following the intervention, the intervention did have a small but significant positive effect on the implicit biases surrounding women and leadership of all participants regardless of age or gender (P = .008).

Advancing Women's Health and Women's Leadership With Endowed Chairs in Women's Health.,Carnes M; Johnson P; Klein W; Jenkins M; Bairey Merz CN,"Gender-based bias and conflation of gender and status are root causes of disparities in women's health care and the slow advancement of women to leadership in academic medicine.

Thus, internal medicine has considerable opportunity to develop women leaders in academic medicine and promote women's health equity.To probe whether holding an endowed chair-which confers status-in women's health may be an effective way to advance women leaders in academic medicine and women's health, the authors explored the current status of endowed chairs in women's health in internal medicine. They found that the number of these endowed chairs in North America increased from 7 in 2013 to 19 in 2015, and all were held by women.

Gender compositions in eight leadership tiers from senior leadership to medical school department directors were analyzed. Data analysis included gender compositions by leadership tier and faculty. Results: Male representation is greater at higher leadership tiers, with the largest imbalance being at the level of medical school department heads. The faculty of medicine has more men in leadership positions than the average of the other faculties (p = 0.02), though similar to schools of engineering, business, dentistry, and pharmacy. Across the eight leadership tiers, a significant trend exists between tier and proportions, indicating that male representation was greater at higher tiers (p < 0.001).

"Women's leadership in neuropsychology: historical perspectives, present trends, and future directions.",Sachs BC; Benitez A; Buelow MT; Gooding A; Schaefer LA; Sim AH; Tussey CM; Shear PK,"OBJECTIVE: Although psychology has become a female-dominated field, this pattern of gender representation has not held true within the specialty of neuropsychology. In recent years more women have been pursuing careers in neuropsychology, and while the balance of male and female neuropsychologists as a whole has shifted, it is unclear whether the gender composition of leadership has also changed. Our goal was to survey various neuropsychological organizations, training programs, editorial boards, and organizations granting board certification to determine the current gender composition of leadership positions within neuropsychology. METHOD: A literature review was conducted to examine past trends of gender composition in neuropsychology, psychology, medicine, and academia. Data on current gender compositions of the field were culled from publicly available websites and through personal communication with representatives from major psychological and neuropsychological organizations. RESULTS: We found that the overall composition of the field has changed over time, but notable gender disparities in leadership positions remain. Women still comprise the minority of leadership positions within most neuropsychological organizations, editorial boards for neuropsychology journals, and fellow positions in major neuropsychological organizations. More equitable representation has been achieved in the directorships of training programs and ABPP/ABCN board certification. CONCLUSION: We review the historical trends in gender discrepancies in leadership in neuropsychology and discuss these within the broader arenas of academia, research, and medicine. We conclude with a summary addressing potential causes for these discrepancies, including work-life balance issues, discrimination, institutional bias, and various other factors. We also provide pragmatic suggestions to help address these continued disparities.",2018,Feb,Clin Neuropsychol,32,2,217-234,,10.1080/13854046.2017.1420234,29376466,#58,Sachs 2018,"",""
A network's gender composition and communication pattern predict women's leadership success.,Yang Y; Chawla NV; Uzzi B,"Many leaders today do not rise through the ranks but are recruited directly out of graduate programs into leadership positions. We use a quasi-experiment and instrumental-variable regression to understand the link between students' graduate school social networks and placement into leadership positions of varying levels of authority. Our data measure students' personal characteristics and academic performance, as well as their social network information drawn from 4.5 million email correspondences among hundreds of students who were placed directly into leadership positions. After controlling for students' personal characteristics, work experience, and academic performance, we find that students' social networks strongly predict placement into leadership positions. For males, the higher a male student's centrality in the school-wide network, the higher his leadership-job placement will be. Men with network centrality in the top quartile have an expected job placement level that is 1.5 times greater than men in the bottom quartile of centrality. While centrality also predicts women's placement, high-placing women students have one thing more: an inner circle of predominantly female contacts who are connected to many nonoverlapping third-party contacts. Women with a network centrality in the top quartile and a female-dominated inner circle have an expected job placement level that is 2.5 times greater than women with low centrality and a male-dominated inner circle.

"Gender coding in job advertisements for academic, non-academic, and leadership positions in emergency medicine.",O'Brien K; Petra V; Lal D; Kwai K; McDonald M; Wallace J; Jeanmonod C; Jeanmonod R,"OBJECTIVES: Gender disparities continue to exist in emergency medicine (EM) despite increasing percentages of women in medical school and residencies. Prior studies in other male dominated industries have shown using masculine or feminine-coded language in job advertisements affects the proportion of male versus female applicants who choose to apply for those jobs. The goal of this study was to determine if gender-coding exists in EM job advertisements, and to see if there were differences between academic vs. non-academic jobs or administrative vs. non-administrative jobs. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study of EM jobs advertised in the United States on 13 academic and non-academic medical job databases from September 2020-February 2021. Using a gender decoder program based on prior research by Gaucher et al. on gendered wording in job advertisements, we analyzed each job to determine if the job advertisement was overall highly masculine, masculine, highly feminine, feminine, or neutral. Each job was categorized as academic, non-academic, administrative, or non-administrative. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four EM job advertisements were posted during the study period. Forty-four (59.4%) of these coded out as masculine or strongly masculine, 18 (24.3%) coded out as feminine or strongly feminine, and 12 (16.2%) were neutral. Only one job advertisement contained no gender-coded words. There were no differences in the gender-coding of academic, non-academic, or administrative jobs. CONCLUSION: Job advertisements for EM physicians tend to contain more masculine-coded language. Almost all job advertisements for emergency medicine physicians in this study contained at least one gender-coded word. Further studies could explore whether changing the language of job advertisements in EM has an impact on the proportion of women who choose to apply to EM jobs.",2022,May,Am J Emerg Med,55,,6-10,,10.1016/j.ajem.2022.02.023,35231866,#60,O'Brien 2022,"",""
Perceptions of Gender and Race Equality in Leadership and Advancement Among Military Family Physicians.,Massaquoi MA; Reese TR; Barrett J; Nguyen D,"INTRODUCTION: There is increasing interest in assessing gender and race-based disparities in academic medicine and healthcare leadership in civilian medicine and the U.S. Military Health System. Approximately 15% of U.S. active duty service members are women, and racial minorities are 30% of the total active duty force. This study evaluates the following factors among uniformed services family physicians: gender and race representation in attaining early career leadership positions during training and 2 years postresidency; perceptions regarding leadership opportunities and career advancement. METHODS: Registered attendees (n = 300) of the 2016 Uniformed Services Academy of Family Physicians Annual Meeting were given a voluntary and anonymous online questionnaire. The main outcomes measured were early leadership assignments and perceptions about command/leadership support, gender roles in leadership assignment, confidence to achieve leadership goals, and being passed over for leadership positions. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of registered attendees completed the study questionnaire. Statistically significant results, adjusting for service, grade, race, and gender, were that non-Caucasian family physicians were less likely to be chief residents (odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.01-1.00) and less likely to have leadership positions within 2 years postresidency (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.91). Female family physicians were more likely to agree that gender has a role in assigning leadership positions (odds ratio 2.33, 95% CI 1.01-5.39). There were no differences in perceptions of command support for leadership; confidence in achieving desired leadership level; or in being passed over for leadership positions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important information about perceived gender and race equality among uniformed services family physicians. Key findings included that non-Caucasian military family physicians were less likely to attain junior leadership positions or be assigned to academic settings; and female respondents were more likely to agree that gender has a role in assignment of leadership positions.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study (II-3). SETTING: Accredited Obstetrics and Gynecology residency programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 288 accredited residency programs were identified from 2019 to 2020 with 1237 individuals in leadership positions. INTERVENTIONS: Similar to a 2012 to 2013 survey by Hofler et al, residency program websites and corresponding fellowships (Maternal Fetal Medicine, Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and Gynecologic Oncology), departmental websites, and divisional websites were queried for those in administrative and educational leadership positions. Information regarding gender (as determined by the surrogates of name and photographic gender expression), medical and academic degrees, academic rank, and subspecialty certification was abstracted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within administrative leadership roles, women comprised 29% of chairs, 46% of vice chairs, and 47% of division directors, all significantly lower than men in administrative leadership (p <.001). In educational leadership, women made up 71% of medical school clerkship directors, 58% of residency directors, and 50% fellowship directors.

Physician Burnout-Evidence That Leadership Behaviors Make a Difference: A Cross-Sectional Survey of an Academic Medical Center.,Hu JS; Phillips J; Wee CP; Pangaro LN,"INTRODUCTION: High rates of physician burnout are well documented in the USA. Identifying beneficial leadership behaviors as an organizational approach to mitigating burnout can lead to improved wellness in the physicians that they lead; however, few studies have examined which leadership behaviors are beneficial and which may be detrimental. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This survey study of academic medical center physicians and their physician leaders assessed the correlation between burnout and leadership behaviors. Data were analyzed for the strength of correlation between scores for leadership behaviors and self-reported physician burnout with analysis of variance by sex, time from training, specialty, and age. RESULTS: Of 1,145 physicians surveyed, 305 returned surveys. Among the respondents, 45% were female, 25% were 56 years or older, and 57% self-identified as practitioners of medicine or medicine subspecialties. Two transformational leadership categories of behaviors (idealized influence behaviors and individualized consideration) and one transactional leadership behavior category (contingent reward) correlated favorably with all domains of burnout (P < .0001). Conversely, two transactional leadership categories of burnout (management by exception passive and laissez-faire) correlated unfavorably with all burnout domains. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational interventions are needed to improve burnout in physicians. Adopting favorable leadership behaviors while avoiding unfavorable leadership behaviors can improve burnout in those physicians being led. These findings could inform the conceptual basis of future physician leadership training programs as transactional leadership behaviors also have an impact on physician wellness.",2023,Jul,Mil Med,188,7-8,e1580-e1587,,10.1093/milmed/usac312,36260483,#65,Hu 2023,"",""

The goals of this study are to examine the representation of women in leadership positions in anesthesiology societies compared to women society members and women anesthesiologists and to analyze the trend in women society presidents over time. METHODS: A list of anesthesiology societies was obtained from the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) website. Society leadership positions were obtained via the societies' websites. Gender was determined by images on the society website and images or pronouns on hospital websites and research databases. The percentage of women presidents, vice presidents/presidents-elect, secretaries/treasurers, board of directors/council members, and committee chairs was calculated. The percentage of women in society leadership positions was compared to the percentage of women society members when available, and the percentage of women anesthesiologists in the workforce (26%) using binomial difference of unpaired proportions tests. The trend of women presidents from 1980 to 2020 was analyzed using a Cochran-Armitage trend test. RESULTS: A total of 13 societies were included in this study.

It is unknown whether physician gender-based differences in team leadership exist. The objective of this study was to assess and compare team leadership and patient care in trauma resuscitations led by male and female physicians. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a larger randomized controlled trial using video recordings of emergency department trauma resuscitations at a Level 1 trauma center from April 2016 to December 2017. Subjects included emergency medicine and surgery residents functioning as trauma team leaders. Eligible resuscitations included adult patients meeting institutional trauma activation criteria. Two video-recorded observations for each participant were coded for team leadership quality and patient care by 2 sets of raters. Raters were balanced with regard to gender and were blinded to study hypotheses. We used Bayesian regression to determine whether our data supported gender-based advantages in team leadership.

Addressing Gender Disparity: Increase in Female Leadership Increases Gender Equality in Program Director and Fellow Ranks.,Sethi S; Edwards J; Webb A; Mendoza S; Kumar A; Chae S,"INTRODUCTION: Women make up 15% of the total number of practicing gastroenterology (GI) physicians in the US. Despite this disparity, only 33% of the current GI fellows are female. Increasing female GIs is a major goal of all four GI societies. It is known that gender disparity exists in the field of gastroenterology, and women are underrepresented in the leadership ranks and trainee level at academic programs. Whether an increase in female leadership in academic medicine is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship in GI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected via a standardized protocol from all 173 US gastroenterology fellowship programs up until October 2018 from program websites and supplemented by online surveys completed by program coordinators. Any missing information was collected by calling the program coordinators. Data were collected on gender and academic rank of the program director, associate program director, division chief, chair of medicine, program size, academic center affiliation, number, and academic rank of female faculty and geographic region. The association was assessed using a Chi-square test or independent samples t test. RESULTS: In leadership positions, men were listed as comprising 86% of chairs, 82% of division chiefs, 76% of program directors and 63% of associate program directors. Forty-three percent of programs did not have female representation at any leadership level. The presence of a female program director or female associate program director was associated with an increase in the number of female fellows (4.03 vs 3.20; p = 0.076; 4.26 vs 3.36; p = 0.041), respectively. Overall, the presence of a female in any leadership position led to an increase in the number of female fellows (4.04 females vs 2.87 females; p = 0.007) enrolled in a program. If a GI division chief was male, the program director was more likely to be male as well (81% male vs. 18.8% female). Conversely, having a female division chief was likely to lead to a more equitable program director representation, 54% female to 48% male (p value < 0.0001, OR 5.03 95% CI 2.04-12.3). Furthermore, if either the internal medicine department chair or GI chief was female, the proportion of female program directors increased to 41% as compared to 19% if both were male (p value < 0.0001, OR 2.99 95% CI 1.34-6.6). CONCLUSION: Women are significantly underrepresented in the number of practicing gastroenterologists, at all levels of leadership in GI fellowship programs, and at the fellow level. Increasing the number of women in fellowship leadership positions is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees. Per our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between female leadership in fellowship programs and the gender of trainees. Increasing female representation in leadership positions would not only address current gender disparity, but it may also increase the number of female future GI trainees.",2022,Feb,Dig Dis Sci,67,2,357-363,,10.1007/s10620-020-06686-5,33403481,#71,Sethi 2022,"",""
Power Reimagined: Advancing Women Into Emerging Leadership Positions.,Chaudron LH; Harris TB; Chatterjee A; Lautenberger DM,"Academic medicine is evolving from the traditional model of a medical school and teaching hospital owned by the same entity to one with complex academic medical centers and health systems. This increased complexity is evident not only in the funding streams and organizational priorities of these growing health systems but also in the evolution of leadership roles toward more matrixed positions and more individuals who hold both medical school and health system roles. Given this changing landscape, the authors of this commentary raise the following questions: Will the levers of power remain in the hands of those in traditional academic roles? Or are they moving toward those in roles that are more aligned with the clinical enterprise and health system? Then, if this shift is occurring, what is needed to prepare women to be competitive candidates for these new roles? Because of the long history of and current gender imbalance in academic leadership roles, professional development programs have traditionally focused on preparing women to advance through the faculty ranks and for department chair and decanal roles. With the shift to more complicated health systems, the definitions, responsibilities, and types of leadership roles in academic medicine are also evolving to include nontraditional academic positions in the health system, such as c-suite and other senior executive roles. In parallel to the gender inequities in traditional roles, women are also underrepresented in health system leadership roles. Therefore, it is critical to explicitly identify emerging roles in health care leadership, address systemic barriers, and actively train and prepare women with the knowledge, skills, and experience required for these positions. Only with consistent attention to outcomes and the implementation of intentional systems to engage, prepare, and advance women will the gender gap be closed.",2023,Jun,Acad Med,98,6,661-663,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005129,36598466,#72,Chaudron 2023,"",""
Addressing Gender Equity in Senior Leadership Roles in Translational Science.,Magliano DJ; Macefield VG; Ellis TM; Calkin AC,"Inequities for women exist across many leverage points of an academic career in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) disciplines, ranging from poorer success rates at promotion, reduced grant success, and a lower likelihood of invited conference presentations, to a propensity to undertake the lion's share of academic service roles. Moreover, an almost intractable salary gap exists, along with a stark under-representation of women in senior scientific leadership roles, widespread throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. Numerous factors have been put forward as contributors to this disparity, including the notions that these inequities are a result of a pipeline issue and that women are less qualified or have less experience than men, implicit bias, a lack of flexibility in the work place, a lack of role models, the use of biased measures of success for promotion, and the lack of equitable parental leave programs. In this viewpoint, we address factors shown to contribute to the lack of women in leadership roles. Specifically, we look at systemic barriers, parental and carer leave, and domestic barriers, and we present solutions to address these barriers across an individual's professional and personal life. For women to achieve equity in senior scientific leadership roles, we believe that barriers across all facets of life need to be addressed and that the important contributions that women make and have made to STEMM need to be recognized.",2020,Aug,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,3,4,773-779,,10.1021/acsptsci.0c00056,32832876,#73,Magliano 2020,"",""
Perspectives of female medical faculty in Ethiopia on a leadership fellowship program.,Kvach E; Yesehak B; Abebaw H; Conniff J; Busse H; Haq C,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate a leadership fellowship program through perspectives of Ethiopian women medical faculty participants. METHODS: An intensive two-week leadership development fellowship was designed for women faculty from Ethiopian medical schools and conducted from 2011-2015 at the University of Wisconsin-School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, Wisconsin. Nine Ethiopian women working in early- or mid-level academic positions were selected. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the fellows. Transcripts were reviewed through qualitative analysis to assess the perceived impact of the training on their careers. Three male academic leaders were interviewed to solicit feedback on the program. RESULTS: Eight of 9 fellows were interviewed. Themes describing the benefits of the fellowship included: increased awareness of gender inequities; enhanced motivation for career advancement; increased personal confidence; and improved leadership skills. Fellows provided suggestions for future training and scaling up efforts to promote gender equity. Male leaders described the benefits of men promoting gender equity within academic health centers.

Little is known about gender representation differences in United States academic radiology departments, particularly within the most pursued subspecialties. PURPOSE: To determine whether gender differences exist in United States academic radiology departments across seven subspecialties with respect to academic ranks, departmental leadership positions, experience, and scholarly metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study from November 2018 to June 2020, a database of United States academic radiologists at 129 academic departments in seven subspecialties was created. Each radiologist's academic rank, departmental leadership position (executive-level - Chair, Director, Chief, and Department or Division Head vs vice-level - vice, assistant, or associate positions of executive level), self-identified gender, years in practice, and measures of scholarly productivity (number of publications, citations, and h-index) were compiled from institutional websites, Doximity, LinkedIn, Scopus, and official NPI profiles. The primary outcome, gender composition differences in these cohorts, was analyzed using Chi(2) while continuous data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The adjusted gender difference for all factors was determined using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 5086 academic radiologists (34.7% women) with a median 14 years of practice (YOP) were identified and indexed. There were 919 full professors (26.1% women, p < 0.01) and 1055 executive-level leadership faculty (30.6% women, p < 0.01). Within all subspecialties except breast imaging, women were in the minority (35.4% abdominal, 79.1% breast, 12.1% interventional, 27.5% musculoskeletal, 22.8% neuroradiology, 45.1% pediatric, and 19.5% nuclear; p < 0.01). Relative to subspecialty gender composition, women full professors were underrepresented in abdominal, pediatric, and nuclear radiology (p < 0.05) and women in any executive-level leadership were underrepresented in abdominal and nuclear radiology (p < 0.05). However, after adjusting for h-index and YOP, gender did not influence rates of professorship or executive leadership. The strongest single predictors for professorship or executive leadership were h-index and YOP. CONCLUSION: Women academic radiologists in the United States are underrepresented among senior faculty members despite having similar levels of experience as men. Gender disparities regarding the expected number of women senior faculty members relative to individual subspecialty gender composition were more pronounced in abdominal and nuclear radiology, and less pronounced in breast and neuroradiology. Overall, h-index and YOP were the strongest predictors for full-professorship and executive leadership among faculty. KEY RESULTS: ● Though women comprise 34.7% of all academic radiologists, women are underrepresented among senior faculty members (26.1% of full professors and 30.6% of executive leadership) ● Women in junior faculty positions had higher median years of practice than their male counterparts (10 vs 8 for assistant professors, 21 vs 13 for vice leadership) ● Years of practice and h-index were the strongest predictors for full professorship and executive leadership.",2022,May,Acad Radiol,29,5,714-725,,10.1016/j.acra.2021.05.016,34176728,#75,Goswami 2022,"",""
Gender Differences in Faculty Rank and Leadership Positions Among Hematologists and Oncologists in the United States.,Riaz IB; Siddiqi R; Zahid U; Durani U; Fatima K; Sipra QR; Raina AI; Farooq MZ; Chamberlain AM; Wang Z; Go RS; Marshall AL; Khosa F,"PURPOSE: Gender disparity persists in academic medicine. Female faculty are underrepresented in leadership positions and have lower research output. We studied gender differences in faculty rank and departmental leadership and contributing factors among academic hematologists and oncologists in the United States. METHODS: For clinical faculty at 146 hematology or oncology fellowship programs listed in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database, we collected data on demographics, academic rank, and research output using the Doximity and Scopus databases. We compared unadjusted characteristics of men and women by using 2-sided t tests and χ(2) tests where appropriate. To predict probability of full professorship or leadership position among men versus women, we performed multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for clinical experience in years, number of publications, h-index, clinical trial investigator status, National Institutes of Health funding, and workplace ranking (top 20 v not). RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred sixty academic hematologists and oncologists were included. Women composed 21.9% (n = 142) of full professors, 35.7% (n = 169) of associate professors, and 45.4% (n = 415) of assistant professors. Thirty percent (n = 70) of departmental leaders were women. Female faculty, compared with male faculty, had a lower mean h-index (12.1 v 20.9, respectively; P < .001) and fewer years of professional experience since fellowship (10 v 16 years, respectively; P < .001).

"Moving beyond 'think leadership, think white male': the contents and contexts of equity, diversity and inclusion in physician leadership programmes.",Soklaridis S; Lin E; Black G; Paton M; LeBlanc C; Besa R; MacLeod A; Silver I; Whitehead CR; Kuper A,"The lack of both women and physicians from groups under-represented in medicine (UIM) in leadership has become a growing concern in healthcare. Despite increasing recognition that diversity in physician leadership can lead to reduced health disparities, improved population health and increased innovation and creativity in organisations, progress toward this goal is slow. One strategy for increasing the number of women and UIM physician leaders has been to create professional development opportunities that include leadership training on equity, diversity and inclusivity (EDI). However, the extent to which these concepts are explored in physician leadership programming is not known. It is also not clear whether this EDI content challenges structural barriers that perpetuate the status quo of white male leadership. To explore these issues, we conducted an environmental scan by adapting Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology to centre on three questions: How is EDI currently presented in physician leadership programming? How have these programmes been evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature? How is EDI presented and discussed by the wider medical community? We scanned institutional websites for physician leadership programmes, analysed peer-reviewed literature and examined material from medical education conferences. Our findings indicate that despite an apparent increase in the discussion of EDI concepts in the medical community, current physician leadership programming is built on theories that fail to move beyond race and gender as explanatory factors for a lack of diversity in physician leadership. To address inequity, physician leadership curricula should aim to equip physicians to identify and address the structural factors that perpetuate disparities.",2022,Jun,BMJ Lead,6,2,146-157,,10.1136/leader-2021-000542,36170540,#77,Soklaridis 2022,"",""
Leadership Development in Early Career Scientists: Themes and Feedback from Executive Coaching and Mindful Leadership Training.,Morrow MMB; Schafer MJ; Kantarci K; Mielke MM; Vachon CM; Winham SJ,"Background: Career development is essential for all academic stages, but particularly critical for the growth and retention of early career scientists. In addition to scientific technical training, professional skill development is crucial for the upward transition from postdoctoral trainee to early faculty member and beyond. Building leadership skills, specifically, is an important component of professional development, and the evaluation and reporting of professional development are important to improve and enhance the impact of programs. Methods: The purpose of this article is to share the program evaluation performed on leadership development activities, including executive coaching and mindful leadership training provided to a small group of early career scientists who participated in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Mayo Clinic Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) in Sex Differences Career Enhancement Core and Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) K12 programs during 2020-2022. Results: Eighty-seven percent of participants rated their satisfaction with the executive coaching program as ""Very Satisfied"" or ""Satisfied,"" and 75% of participants were ""Very Satisfied"" or ""Satisfied"" with the mindful leadership training program. The findings of this program evaluation highlight the value of communication skills for navigating precarious situations, building self-efficacy and intentionality in making and holding boundaries for an individual's time and energy.

Building diverse leadership in an academic medical center: The ACCLAIM program.,Drake AF; Sollecito WA; Horneffer KE; Martin JB; Westervelt LM; Murphy BA; Schenck AP; Carter-Edwards L,"As healthcare systems become more complex, medical education needs to adapt in many ways. There is a growing need for more formal leadership learning for healthcare providers, including greater attention to health disparities. An important challenge in addressing health disparities is ensuring inclusive excellence in the leadership of healthcare systems and medical education. Women and those who are underrepresented in medicine (URMs) have historically had fewer opportunities for leadership development and are less likely to hold leadership roles and receive promotions. One successful initiative for improved learning of medical leadership-presented as a case example here-is the Academic Career Leadership Academy in Medicine (ACCLAIM) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. ACCLAIM is uniquely designed for faculty identified as having emerging leadership potential, with an emphasis on women and URMs. Using a leadership learning system approach, annual cohorts of participants (Scholars) interactively participate in a multi-faceted nine-month long learning experience, including group (e.g., guest-speaker weekly presentations and exercises) and individual learning components (e.g., an individual leadership project). Since its initiation in 2012 and through 2021, 111 Scholars have participated in ACCLAIM; included were 57% women and 27% URMs. Two important outcomes described are: short-term impact as illustrated by consistent improvements in quantitively measured leadership knowledge and capabilities; and long-term leadership growth, whereby half of the ACCLAIM graduates have received academic rank promotions and almost two-thirds have achieved new leadership opportunities, with even higher percentages observed for women and URMs; for example, 87% of URMs were either promoted or achieved new leadership positions. Also consistently noted, through qualitative assessments, are broader healthcare system knowledge and shared tactics for addressing common challenges among Scholars. This case example shows that the promotion of leadership equity may jointly enhance professional development while creating opportunities for systems change within academic medical centers. Such an approach can be a potential model for academic medical institutions and other healthcare schools seeking to promote leadership equity and inclusion.",2023,Apr,J Natl Med Assoc,115,2,134-143,,10.1016/j.jnma.2023.01.004,36707367,#79,Drake 2023,"",""
Leadership Identity Development Through Reflection and Feedback in Team-Based Learning Medical Student Teams.,Alizadeh M; Mirzazadeh A; Parmelee DX; Peyton E; Mehrdad N; Janani L; Shahsavari H,"PROBLEM: Studies on leadership identity development through reflection with Team-Based Learning (TBL) in medical student education are rare. We assumed that reflection and feedback on the team leadership process would advance the progression through leadership identity development stages in medical students within the context of classes using TBL. INTERVENTION: This study is a quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest control group. The pretest and posttest were reflection papers of medical students about their experience of leadership during their TBL sessions. In the intervention group, TBL and a team-based, guided reflection and feedback on the team leadership process were performed at the end of all TBL sessions. In the other group, only TBL was used. The Stata 12 software was used. Leadership Identity was treated both as a categorical and quantitative variable to control for differences in baseline and gender variables. Chi-square, t tests, and linear regression analysis were performed. CONTEXT: The population was a cohort of 2015-2016 medical students in a TBL setting at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine. Teams of four to seven students were formed by random sorting at the beginning of the academic year (intervention group n = 20 teams, control group n = 19 teams). OUTCOME: At baseline, most students in both groups were categorized in the Awareness and Exploration stage of leadership identity: 51 (52%) in the intervention group and 59 (55%) in the control group: uncorrected χ(2)(3) = 15.6, design-based F(2.83, 108) = 4.87, p = .003. In the posttest intervention group, 36 (36%) were in exploration, 33 (33%) were in L-identified, 20 (20%) were in Leadership Differentiated, and 10 (10%) were in the Generativity. None were in the Awareness or Integration stages. In the control group, 3 (20%) were in Awareness, 56 (53%) were in Exploration, 35 (33%) were in Leader Identified, 13 (12%) were in Leadership Differentiated. None were in the Generativity and Integration stages. Our hypothesis was supported by the data: uncorrected χ(2)(4) = 18.6, design-based F(3.77, 143) = 4.46, p = .002. The mean of the leadership identity in the pretest, intervention group equaled 1.93 (SD = 0.85) and the pretest, control group mean was 2.36 (SD = 0.86), p = .004. The mean of the posttest, intervention group was 3.04 (SD = 0.98) and posttest, control group mean was 2.54 (SD = 0.74), T = -4.00, design df = 38, p < .001, and adjusted on baseline and gender T = -8.97, design df = 38, p < .001. LESSONS LEARNED: Reflection and feedback on the team leadership process in TBL advances the progression in stages of leadership identity development in medical students.

"Gender Differences in Academic Medicine: Retention, Rank, and Leadership Comparisons From the National Faculty Survey.",Carr PL; Raj A; Kaplan SE; Terrin N; Breeze JL; Freund KM,"PURPOSE: Prior studies have found that women in academic medicine do not advance or remain in their careers in parity with men. The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty. METHOD: The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty. Schools were balanced for public or private status and the four Association of American Medical Colleges geographic regions. The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).

Male faculty were more likely to hold senior leadership positions after adjusting for publications (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership remain across the career trajectories of the faculty cohort in this study.

Peek at the glass ceiling: gender distribution of leadership among emergency medicine residency programs.,Parsons M; Krzyzaniak S; Mannix A; Rocca N; Chan TM; Gottlieb M,"BACKGROUND: A gender gap in faculty rank at academic institutions exists; however, data among graduate medical education (GME) programmes are limited. There is a need to assess gender disparities in GME leadership, as a lack of female leadership may affect recruitment, role modelling and mentorship of female trainees. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the current state of gender in programme leadership (department chair, programme director (PD), associate/assistant PD (APD) and clerkship director (CD)) at accredited Emergency Medicine (EM) programmes in the USA to determine whether a gender gap exists. METHODS: A survey was distributed to EM residency programmes in the USA assessing demographics and gender distribution among programme leadership. If no response was received, information was collected via the programme's website. Data were organised by position, region and length of the programme. We obtained data on the number of female EM physicians in practice and in training/fellowship in 2017 from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Data analysis was completed using descriptive statistics and χ(2) analysis. RESULTS: Of the 226 programmes contacted, 148 responded to the survey (66.3%). Among US EM residency programmes, 11.2% of chairs, 34.6% of PDs, 40.5% of APDs and 46.5% of CDs are women. The percentage of female chairs is significantly lower than the percentage of women in practice or in training in EM. The percentage of female PDs did not differ from the percentage of women in practice or in training in EM. The percentage of female APDs and CDs was significantly higher than the percentage of women in practice but did not differ from the percentage in training. There was wide variability across regions. Four-year programmes had more women in PD and APD positions compared with 3-year programmes (p=0.01).

Leading by Design: Lessons for the Future From 25 Years of the Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) Program for Women.,Jagsi R; Spector ND,"The Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) Program for Women is designed to promote the careers of senior female leaders in academic health care in a way that ultimately seeks to transform culture and promote gender equity far beyond the careers of its participants. In an era of increased awareness of gender inequity within academic medicine, the longevity of the ELAM program raises several important questions. First, why is such a program still needed? Second, what exactly does it do, and what has been its influence on its participants and beyond? And third, what lessons can ELAM's example provide to help guide the medical profession as it strives to promote gender equity in the field? In this Invited Commentary, the authors seek to answer these questions from the perspective of a recent program participant and the current program director. The authors review the evidence that identifies how women, even today, face accumulating disadvantage over the course of their academic careers, stemming from repeated encounters with powerful unconscious biases and stereotypes, societal expectations for a gendered division of domestic labor, and still-present overt discrimination and sexual harassment. They describe ELAM's approach, which builds the knowledge and skills of the women who participate in the program, while also intentionally raising their visibility within their home institutions so that they have opportunities to share with institutional leaders what they have learned in ways that not only promote their own careers but also support gender equity in the broader environment.

Analysis of Race and Ethnicity Among United States Medical Board Leadership.,Jacobs JW; Fleming TK; Jagsi R; Stanford FC; Spector ND; Booth GS; Silver JK,"Background: The inequitable representation of women and members of racial and ethnic minority groups in leadership positions within academic medicine is an ongoing challenge with practical and realistic solutions. The purpose of this study was to assess the race and ethnicity of individuals in leadership positions among the 24 Member Boards of Directors (Boards) of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the race and ethnicity patterns for individuals holding leadership positions among the 24 Boards of the ABMS as of March 1, 2022. Two independent coders with 100% concordance recorded race and ethnicity using online biographies and photographs. Percentages were compared to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2018 data reports. Results: Among 449 director positions, 415 (92.4%) were physicians. Within the physician subset, 12.3% (51/415) Asian, 8.2% (34/415) Black, and 3.4% (14/415) Hispanic individuals were identified. Women who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups have less representation than men of the same race. Of 24 Boards, 37.5% (9/24) had no Asian women, 50.0% (12/24) had no Black women, and 75.0% (18/24) had no Hispanic women.

These differences are manifest across subspecialties in academic medicine and even in diagnostic radiology. There are limited data available addressing diversity among nuclear medicine specialists. Thus, our primary objective was to compare gender representation in academic and leadership positions among faculty members in nuclear medicine in Canada and the United States. Our secondary objective was to study the influences to account for the existing disparity in academic nuclear medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) and Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS), we created a database of faculty members in nuclear medicine. For assessment of academic performance, the h-index, number of publications, number of citations, and years of active research were extracted using Scopus. RESULTS: The academic ranks of 237 faculty members were used for analysis; of this group, 16.95% of associate professors were female. Women were less frequently represented in higher academic ranks, and women were also less frequently represented in leadership ranks (13.6% female vs 86.4% male). The h-index was comparable across genders. CONCLUSION: Female nuclear medicine specialists are underrepresented in academic and leadership positions compared with their male counterparts. This difference in numbers is unlikely to be because of academic performance given that both genders had comparable academic performance metrics in our study. The results show the need for devising strategies to promote diversity in academic and leadership positions across nuclear medicine specialists.",2019,Jan,AJR Am J Roentgenol,212,1,146-150,,10.2214/AJR.18.20062,30422710,#86,Moghimi 2019,"",""

Achieving Gender Equity Is Our Responsibility: Leadership Matters.,Acosta DA; Lautenberger DM; Castillo-Page L; Skorton DJ,"Across academic medicine, and particularly among faculty and medical school leadership, the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to gender diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Association of American Medical Colleges has launched a bold gender equity initiative, endorsed by its Board of Directors, to implore academic medical institutions to take meaningful and effective actions.Defining what progress should look like to guide these actions is worth deeper exploration. It is not enough to measure the representation of different genders at various levels of leadership within our institutions. Research and experience we share suggests more must be done, especially for women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. What is needed is a fundamental conversation about privilege, intersectionality across different backgrounds, and progress.Institutional leaders have a choice to make. Will we make gender equity a top priority system-wide because we recognize that doing so leads to organizational excellence? Do we understand that establishing a robust, comprehensive definition of gender equity and how it is practiced will result in better outcomes for all? And are we ready and able to prioritize and be accountable for efforts that are measurable, with clear definitions of progress; driven and reinforced by leadership directives; inclusive of all, including men as well as women of diverse backgrounds and orientations; and systemic rather than ad-hoc?

Gender Gap in Leadership in Academic Medicine and Dentistry: What Are the Barriers? What Can Be Done To Correct It?,Gangwani P; Kolokythas A,"PURPOSE: The present study aimed to report the main barriers to women's advancement in leadership and high-rank academic positions in the fields of medicine and dentistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted of the MEDLINE database using the PubMed search engine. The Google Scholar search engine was also used to access scholarly articles across all disciplines. A total of 173 reports and abstracts published in the English language were retrieved and evaluated for their content. Of these, 32 were initially selected and reviewed. Finally, 16 studies focusing on gender-related discrepancies in healthcare concerning leadership and academic advancement were included. RESULTS: The following themes emerged as the main contributors to the gender disparity in academic medicine and dentistry: 1) the lack of appropriate role models and mentorship for successful socialization of female faculty; 2) the lack of peer support for women's promotion through the academic ranks and their selection for executive administrative roles at equal rates as their male counterparts; and 3) implicit bias and negative stereotypes. CONCLUSIONS: A need exists to increase the number of female role models and enhance mentorship to increase the attraction toward academic careers in medicine and dentistry.

Gender disparity in dermatologic society leadership: A global perspective.,Karol DL; Sheriff L; Jalal S; Ding J; Larson AR; Trister R; Khosa F,"BACKGROUND: In the last half-century, there has been increased representation of women in medicine. Despite this increase, there continues to be underrepresentation of women in medical leadership positions. The objective of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of gender disparity in the leadership of professional societies of dermatology worldwide. METHODS: Online databases were used to extract the names of global dermatologic societies. Individual society websites were accessed to obtain information on executive members. Data not available on society websites were obtained through internet searches. Scopus was used to obtain H-indexes and other bibliometric outcomes. RESULTS: Our data collection spanned 92 countries, with 1733 society leaders identified and information available for 1710. In North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East, women were in a minority in dermatology professional society leadership. In South America, Central America, and Africa, women were in a slight majority. Across all professional societies, the role of president was more frequently held by men (n = 95) as opposed to women (n = 75). Female leaders were less likely to hold concurrent academic positions as deans/chairpersons/directors (83.33%) than their male counterparts (92.06%).

A Vicious Cycle of Bias: Residents' Perceptions of Leadership in Health Care.,Ju M; van Schaik SM,"PURPOSE: Despite growing interest in shared leadership models, autocratic physician leadership remains the norm in health care. Stereotype and bias limit leadership by members of other professions. Furthermore, traditional views of effective clinical leadership emphasize agentic behaviors associated with male gender. To shift the prototypical concept of a leader from a male physician to a more inclusive prototype, a better understanding of prototype formation is needed. This study examines leader prototypes and their development among resident physicians through the lens of leadership categorization theory. METHOD: One researcher conducted semistructured interviews with anesthesia and internal medicine residents at a single institution, asking participants to describe their ideal team leader and comment on the video-recorded performance of either a male or female nurse practitioner (NP) leading a simulated resuscitation. Interview questions explored participants' perceptions of NPs as team leaders and how these perceptions developed. The researchers conducted deductive analysis to examine leadership prototypes and prototype formation, and inductive analysis to derive additional themes. RESULTS: The majority of residents described a male physician as the ideal resuscitation team leader. Exposure to male physician leaders, and lack of exposure to NP leaders, contributed to this prototype formation. Residents described a vicious cycle in which bias against female and NP leaders diminished acceptance of their leadership by team members, resulting in decreased confidence and performance, further aggravating bias. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide suggestions for interventions that can help shift the leadership prototype in health care and promote shared leadership models. These include increasing exposure to different professionals of either gender in leadership roles and increased representation in educational materials, education about effective leadership strategies to create awareness of the benefits of shared leadership, and reflection during team training to increase awareness of bias and the backlash effect faced by individuals whose behaviors counter established stereotypes.",2021,Nov,Acad Med,96,11S,S103-S108,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004338,34380932,#91,Ju 2021,"",""
The Impact of Physician Race and Sex on Patient Ranking of Physician Competence and Perception of Leadership Ability.,Dunn LK; Pham E; Kabil E; Kleiman AM; Hilton EJ; Lyons GR; Ma JZ; Nemergut EC; Forkin KT,"Background Biases affect patient perceptions of their physician and influence the physician-patient relationship. While racial disparities in care and inequities in the healthcare workforce are well-documented, the impact of physician race on patient perceptions remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of physician race and sex on patient perceptions during simulated preoperative encounters. Methods Three hundred patients recruited consecutively in the Preanesthesia Evaluation and Testing Center viewed pictures of 4 anesthesiologists (black male, white male, black female, white female) in random order while listening to a set of paired audio recordings describing general anesthesia. Participants ranked each anesthesiologist on confidence, intelligence, and likelihood of choosing the anesthesiologist to care for their family member, and chose the one anesthesiologist most like a leader. Results Compared to white anesthesiologists, black anesthesiologists had greater odds of being ranked more confident (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.89; P=0.008) and being considered a leader (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.50 to 2.84; P<0.0001). Among white participants, black anesthesiologists had greater odds of being ranked more intelligent (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.54 to 2.81; P<0.0001) and were more likely to be chosen to care for a family member (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.08; P<0.0001).

The evolution of leadership: analyzing the presidents of American Dermatology Societies overtime.,Abushukur Y; Mansour M; Cascardo C; Keeley J; Knackstedt T,"Within organized dermatology, it is imperative that leaders embody a diverse group of individuals, reflective of the dermatologists they represent and the greater U.S. population. Despite women constituting more than half of the dermatologic workforce, they represent a leadership minority in dermatology society higher level positions. This gap is evident by fewer women holding presidency positions within prominent dermatological societies; however, a comprehensive comparison across multiple societies has yet to be made. Our study analyzes and compares demographic as well as academic metrics of presidents from 16 prominent dermatology societies spanning 22 years, 2000-2021. Data were collected using organization websites, which demonstrated 247 unique presidents over 22 years. Of these presidents, 175 (70.9%) were male and 72 (29.1%) were female.

Gender and Pathways to Leadership in Academic Anesthesiology: A Qualitative Content Analysis of US Chairpersons' Curricula Vitae.,Lane-Fall MB; Hastie MJ; Kleid M; Yarabarla V; Miltiades AN; Wiener-Kronish JP; Pian-Smith MC,"BACKGROUND: Women are underrepresented in medicine and academic anesthesiology, and especially in leadership positions. We sought to characterize career achievement milestones of female versus male academic anesthesiology chairs to understand possible gender-related differences in pathways to leadership. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cross-sectional analysis. In November 2019, curricula vitae (CVs) were requested from then-current members of the US Association of Academic Anesthesiology Chairs. Data reflecting accomplishments up to the time of chair appointment were systematically extracted from CVs and analyzed using a mixed methods approach with qualitative content analysis supplemented by descriptive statistics and bivariate statistical testing. Missing data were not imputed. RESULTS: Seventy-two CVs were received from eligible individuals (response rate 67.3%). The respondent sample was 12.5% women (n = 9), 87.5% men (n = 63), and no transgender or nonbinary people; this is similar to the known gender balance in anesthesiology chairs in the United States. No statistically significant differences in objective markers of academic achievement at the time of chair appointment were evident for female versus male chairs, including time elapsed between the first faculty appointment and assumption of the chair role (median 25 vs 18 years, P = .06), number of publications at the time the chair was assumed (101 vs 69, P = .28), or proportion who had ever held a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant as principal investigator (44.4% vs 25.4%, 0.25). Four phenotypes of career paths were discernible in the data: the clinician-administrator, the educator, the investigator, and the well-rounded scholar; these did not differ by gender. CONCLUSIONS: Female chairpersons who were members of the Association of Academic Anesthesiology Chairs in the United States demonstrated similar patterns of academic achievement as compared to male chairpersons at the time the position of chair was assumed, suggesting that they were equally qualified for the role as compared to men. Four patterns of career achievements were evident in the chairperson group, suggesting multiple viable pathways to this leadership position.",2024,Jan,Anesth Analg,,,,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006821,38289863,#94,Lane-Fall 2024,"",""
Priority strategies to improve gender equity in Canadian emergency medicine: proceedings from the CAEP 2021 Academic Symposium on leadership.,McIlveen-Brown E; Morris J; Lim R; Johnson K; Byrne A; Bischoff T; Hurley K; Mann M; Menchetti I; Pardhan A; Pham C; Sheppard G; Zia A; Chan TM,"OBJECTIVES: Gender inequities are deeply rooted in our society and have significant negative consequences. Female physicians experience numerous gender-related inequities (e.g., microaggressions, harassment, violence). These inequities have far-reaching consequences on health, well-being and career longevity and may result in the devaluing of various strengths that female emergency physicians bring to the table. This, in turn, has an impact on patient healthcare experience and outcomes. During the 2021 Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) Academic Symposium, a national collaborative sought to understand gender inequities in emergency medicine in Canada. METHODS: We used a multistep stakeholder-engagement-based approach (harnessing both quantitative and qualitative methods) to identify and prioritize problems with gender equity in emergency medicine in Canada. Based on expert consultation and literature review, we developed recommendations to effect change for the higher priority problems. We then conducted a nationwide consultation with the Canadian emergency medicine community via online engagement and the CAEP Academic Symposium to ensure that these priority problems and solutions were appropriate for the Canadian context. CONCLUSION: Via the above process, 15 recommendations were developed to address five unique problem areas.

Inclusivity in Leader Selection: An 8-Step Process to Promote Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Leadership.,Holladay CL; Cavanaugh KJ; Perkins LD; Woods AL,"At a systemic level, organizations need to take intentional steps to build inclusion, equity, and diversity at all levels. In accordance with this need, organizations have been catalyzed by national conversations surrounding gender and racial/ethnic discrimination to generate sustainable change that addresses the disenfranchisement of women and racial/ethnic minorities. Although progress toward addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate these inequities has been made in recent years, research indicates that underrepresentation at the leadership level persists in academic medicine. Further, those in more senior roles are more likely to select, sponsor, and/or mentor individuals like themselves, thereby depriving minority populations of experiences directly correlated with career development and advancement. Hence, the authors posit a focus on the characteristics and competencies of a leader along with a structured selection process is an effective intervention to reduce bias and support inclusion by recalibrating the representation of leadership within academic medical centers. To this end, the authors developed a sequential 8-step leader selection process informed by their model of leadership characteristics and competencies. This process includes a policy update, selection of interview panels, training of panelists, screening the candidate pool, structured interview guides, final candidate slates, assessments of final candidates, and development of newly selected leaders. By following this process, the authors' organization has seen an increase in the representation of women and racial/ethnic minority leaders, an increase in employees' favorable perceptions specific to representation, and data indicative of developing and maintaining an internal diverse leadership candidate pipeline. Ultimately, inclusion makes stronger and more resilient organizations. By following a standardized process grounded in leadership characteristics and competencies, academic medical centers can see changes in their leadership that mirror the populations they lead and serve.

The difference in H-index between genders was statistically significant (P < 0.05) with men possessing a higher median for H-index [13] than women [9]. Transplantation Surgery [17] had the highest median H-indices for female surgeons. Male surgeons (n = 18) were twice as likely to be Departmental Chairs as their female counterparts (n = 9). However, female surgical oncologists held the highest proportion of leadership positions (31%). CONCLUSION: A significant gender-based disparity was found in leadership positions and academic ranks.

"Fifteen-year trends in participation of women in presentation and leadership positions in the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery, 2006 to 2020.",Weaver ML; Sorber R; Cooper M,"OBJECTIVE: The implementation of integrated vascular surgery training programs was recently shown to be associated with an increase in women entering the field. However, whether this has precipitated a subsequent increase in the active participation of women in academic vascular societies remains unclear. We sought to examine the trends of academic inclusion of women vascular surgeons and surgical trainees over the past 15 years at the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery (SAVS). METHODS: Scientific programs for annual meetings of the SAVS, and program matriculation statistics from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, were reviewed for the period of 2006 to 2020. Yearly rates and 3-year averages of conference and society participation and vascular surgery training program matriculation rates were calculated and compared with proportion testing. Spearman correlation testing was used to compare trends, with ρ ≥0.600 defined as a strong correlation. RESULTS: Examining 3-year means, the average number of women authors per SAVS abstract increased from 0.78 to 1.42 over the course of the study period (P < .001), and the overall rate of women authors steadily increased from 12.8% to 21.5% (P < .001). Although this remains less than the proportion of women matriculating into vascular surgery programs in 2019 (29.3%; P = .007), the upward trend of women entering vascular surgery overall, and particularly vascular surgery fellowship, strongly correlates with the average number of women authors on abstracts at SAVS (ρ = 0.709 and ρ = 0.737, respectively). The percentage of women presenting authors increased from 9.7% to 28.4% (P = .004), but there was no increase in the percentage of women senior authors (10.1% to 9.6%; P = .92). In the 15-year period, only one abstract of 347 (0.3%) had full authorship by women vs 35.1% with full authorship by men (P < .001). Although the increase of women matriculating into vascular surgery programs over the study period did not correlate with the increase of women in senior leadership positions (ρ < 0.600), there was an increase in the number of women in committee chair positions (0.0% to 25.9%; P = .005), which correlated strongly with increasing society membership (ρ = 0.716). Additionally, there was an increase in women holding executive council positions from 0% to 10.0% (P = .08), although this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Participation of women authoring and presenting papers at the SAVS has increased over the past 15 years at a rate that strongly correlates with the increasing rate of women entering vascular surgery training programs. It is important that society leadership opportunities continue to parallel this trend as we seek to further improve diversity in vascular surgery.",2022,Mar,J Vasc Surg,75,3,774-782,,10.1016/j.jvs.2021.08.097,34601047,#104,Weaver 2022,"",""
Academic promotion and leadership: 'moving the needle' for the enhancement of gender equality in Tunisian higher education institutional members of the RMEI network following the TARGET framework.,Chouari M; Ghiss M; Zabaniotou A,"Although job opportunities, recruitment criteria, health insurance and social welfare are equally available regardless of sex, academic promotion at higher education institutions (HEIs) has so far been a challenging issue for women more than men. Even though there are not legislative policies or political strategies proscribing gender discrimination, the under-representation of women in high profile positions is thought-provoking as it was found by this study on collecting segregating data at the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences of Sousse (FAHSS) and to a lesser degree at the National Engineering School of Sousse (ENISO). Given insufficient research in the area under investigation, and despite the shortage of data needed for examination, this study makes use of and analyses the available data collected from Sousse University. Built upon the findings, this paper sets forth to examine impediments as challenges to progress which are encountered by women. Despite the belief that gender parity has been acquired, it is still a challenge to progress to endorse the culture of gender equality at higher education institutions. The study entails the activities of the gender equality committee created at Sousse University in 2018 with the support of the Mediterranean Network of Engineering Schools (RMEI) and under the framework of the EU TARGET project entitled 'Taking a reflexive approach to gender equality at Institutional transformation'.",2021,,Open Res Eur,1,,14,,10.12688/openreseurope.13217.2,37645105,#105,Chouari 2021,"",""
Women at the top: a qualitative study of women in leadership positions in emergency medicine in Canada.,Allen M; Lazor J; Nirmalanathan K; Nowacki A,"OBJECTIVES: For the last two decades, more than half of Canadian medical students have been women, with an increasing number of medical trainees choosing emergency medicine as their careers. Despite a proportional increase of women in full-time faculty positions in emergency medicine, women are still underrepresented in leadership. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of women leaders in emergency medicine to identify common themes that may have contributed to their acquisition of leadership roles. METHODS: Participants included women emergency medicine physicians in Canada who currently or previously held a leadership position. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Inductive thematic analysis was performed on the interview transcripts. Transcribed data were coded and categorized into recurrent themes. A narrative summary of the most impactful themes was presented. RESULTS: Twenty participants were interviewed. Most participants perceived career opportunities were due to chance, related to personal skill set, or required additional training. Participants highlighted the importance of mentorship and sponsorship. Gender expectations and traditional gender roles were perceived as having a negative impact on career leadership success. Participants acknowledged the need for women in leadership to empower younger generations of women to become leaders. For future emergency medicine leaders, participants suggested applying for leadership positions early, networking, and seeking mentorship. Potential supportive changes to leadership structures included explicit parental leave policies, flexible scheduling, and job sharing to encourage women leaders. CONCLUSION: To date, there has been no Canadian specific study exploring the factors contributing to the success of women leaders in emergency medicine. This study examines career advancement of women leaders in emergency medicine and provides useful insight to those aspiring to grow their careers, as well as to mentors and sponsors of women in emergency medicine.",2024,Nov,CJEM,26,11,819-827,,10.1007/s43678-024-00751-y,39073699,#106,Allen 2024,"",""

METHOD: The authors conducted a qualitative analysis of in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted in 2022 with a diverse sample of clinician-scientists who received new National Institutes of Health K08 or K23 Career Development Awards between 2006 and 2009. A total of 859 of the 915 survey respondents (94%) were eligible to be recruited for the qualitative study. Qualitative analysis was informed by thematic analysis and used a social constructionist approach to understanding participants' conceptualizations of their experiences. Interview transcripts were coded using an iterative, inductive coding process. Themes were generated by reviewing coded data and identifying common patterns in participant narratives, affording particular attention to participants' discussion of the effect of race and/or gender on their leadership experiences. RESULTS: Sixty clinician-scientists participated in individual interviews. Five themes were generated surrounding participants' conceptualizations of their leadership experiences. Themes were (1) feeling unprepared for leadership roles, (2) reluctance and lack of intention in attaining leadership positions, (3) influence of networks on leadership access and decision-making, (4) impact-related benefits and downsides of leadership, and (5) confining ideas of who leaders are. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the need for formal leadership training in academic medicine and the importance of mentorship and sponsorship in attaining and succeeding in leadership positions. Individuals from communities underrepresented in leadership positions faced additional challenges internalizing a leadership identity. Efforts to encourage current leaders to engage in intentional succession planning and development of faculty toward leadership roles, including expansion of institutional leadership development programs, are needed to promote equitable distribution of leadership opportunities.",2025,Jan,Acad Med,100,1,42-49,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005777,38838195,#107,Greene 2025,"",""
"Barriers, Challenges, and Solutions: What Can We Learn About Leadership in Academic Medicine From a Qualitative Study of Emergency Medicine Women Chairs?",Hobgood CD; Draucker C,"PURPOSE: Women have made significant gains in leadership across all disciplines in academic medicine but have not yet achieved leadership parity as department chairs. The authors investigated the challenges experienced by one cohort of women department chairs in emergency medicine (EM) and the solutions they proposed to address these challenges. METHOD: The authors conducted a qualitative descriptive study of 19 of 20 possible current and emeritus emergency medicine women department chairs at academic medical centers between April and December 2020. Participant interviews elicited self-reported demographic characteristics and narrative responses to a semistructured interview template that focused on the role of gender in their leadership and career trajectories. Interviews were transcribed, blinded, and iteratively coded and categorized. RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated 4 common challenges and 5 enacted or proposed solutions. The challenges discussed by the participants were: feeling unprepared for the role of department chair, being one of few women in leadership, inheriting unhealthy department cultures, and facing negative faculty reactions. The individual- and institutional-level solutions discussed by the participants were: gaining and maintaining confidence (individual), maintaining accountability and mission alignment (individual), facilitating teamwork (individual), supporting women's leadership (institution), and creating safe leadership cultures (institution). CONCLUSIONS: Women department chairs in EM were successful academic leaders despite confronting several challenges to their leadership.

Characterizing Global Gender Representation in Veterinary Executive Leadership.,Vezeau N; Kemelmakher H; Silva Seixas J; Ivie I; Magdy A; Endacott I; Amrani M; Rendina C; Wang SG,"Veterinary medicine is an increasingly feminized field, with growing numbers of veterinary students and professionals identifying as women. Increased representation of women in senior veterinary education leadership has not yet been examined across all global regions. To address this question, we compiled a comprehensive list of veterinary academic executives from veterinary educational institutions listed by the World Veterinary Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the World Organisation for Animal Health. In total, data from 720 veterinary schools in 118 countries were obtained via an online search of each school's webpage to retrieve information on executive-level leaders and their gender representation. Out of 2263 executive leaders included, 784 (34.6%) were inferred to be women. Of 733 top executives-deans or their equivalents-187 (25.5%) were inferred to be women. At the national level, the proportion of women in executive teams was positively correlated with Gross Domestic Product, Gender Development Index, and negatively correlated with Gender Inequality Index. This is the first study to demonstrate inequity in the gender composition of veterinary educational leadership across the majority of veterinary schools worldwide, and regional trends thereof. It also identifies potential socioeconomic issues closely connected to gender equity in these spaces. To monitor progress towards gender equity within the profession, future work is needed to assess gender representation over different phases of veterinary career tracks, including in student populations.

Diversity in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Leadership.,Toledo P; Duce L; Adams J; Ross VH; Thompson KM; Wong CA,"BACKGROUND: Women and minorities are underrepresented in US academic medicine. The Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce emphasized the importance of diverse leadership for reducing health care disparities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the demographics of the American Society of Anesthesiologists leadership. We hypothesized that the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities is less than that of their respective proportions in the general physician workforce. METHODS: An electronic survey was developed by the authors and mailed to 595 members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists leadership who had valid email addresses, including the members of the 2014 House of Delegates and state society leaders who were not the members of the House of Delegates. Univariate statistics were used to characterize survey responses and the probability distributions were estimated using the binomial distribution. A one-sample t test was used to compare the percentage of women and minorities in the survey pool to that of the corresponding percentages in the general physician workforce (38.0% women and 8.9% minorities), and the US population (51.0% women and 32.0% minorities). RESULTS: The survey response rate was 54%. A total of 21.1% (95% confidence interval: 16.4%-25.7%) of respondents were women and 6.0% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%-8.7%) were minorities. The proportion of women in the American Society of Anesthesiologist leadership was lower than the general medical workforce and the US population (P < .001 for both); the proportion of underrepresented minorities was lower than the US population (P < .001).

Goleman's Leadership styles at different hierarchical levels in medical education.,Saxena A; Desanghere L; Stobart K; Walker K,"BACKGROUND: With current emphasis on leadership in medicine, this study explores Goleman's leadership styles of medical education leaders at different hierarchical levels and gain insight into factors that contribute to the appropriateness of practices. METHODS: Forty two leaders (28 first-level with limited formal authority, eight middle-level with wider program responsibility and six senior- level with higher organizational authority) rank ordered their preferred Goleman's styles and provided comments. Eight additional senior leaders were interviewed in-depth. Differences in ranked styles within groups were determined by Friedman tests and Wilcoxon tests. Based upon style descriptions, confirmatory template analysis was used to identify Goleman's styles for each interviewed participant. Content analysis was used to identify themes that affected leadership styles. RESULTS: There were differences in the repertoire and preferred styles at different leadership levels. As a group, first-level leaders preferred democratic, middle-level used coaching while the senior leaders did not have one preferred style and used multiple styles. Women and men preferred democratic and coaching styles respectively. The varied use of styles reflected leadership conceptualizations, leader accountabilities, contextual adaptations, the situation and its evolution, leaders' awareness of how they themselves were situated, and personal preferences and discomfort with styles. The not uncommon use of pace-setting and commanding styles by senior leaders, who were interviewed, was linked to working with physicians and delivering quickly on outcomes.

Equal Pay for Equal Work in the Dean Suite: Addressing Occupational Gender Segregation and Compensation Inequities Among Medical School Leadership.,Gottlieb AS; Dandar VM; Lautenberger DM; Best C; Jagsi R,"In 2022, the Association of American Medical Colleges published data from its annual Dean's Office Staff Compensation and Dean's Compensation Surveys in a new report addressing salary equity among medical school leadership. These data, disaggregated by gender and race/ethnicity, represent earnings of the senior most leaders in the dean suite and have historically been shared only with medical school Deans and principal business officers. The report shows that the highest-ranking decanal positions in U.S. medical schools are filled along the lines of traditional gender stereotypes (with men in clinical affairs and research affairs deanships and women in admissions, diversity affairs, faculty affairs, and student affairs deanships) and that the roles held mostly by men carry grander titles (e.g., senior associate dean vs assistant dean) and significantly higher salaries than those typically held by women. Additionally, within the same decanal positions, women earn lower median compensation than men. In this commentary, the authors describe limited advancement and lower compensation as foregone conclusions for women in medicine and science due to a professional model that places a premium on activities traditionally pursued by men.

This study evaluated the impact of a faculty development program called the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP) on participants' (1) self-ratings of efficacy, (2) promotion in academic rank, and (3) institutional retention. METHOD: Participants from the 2013-2020 LAMP cohorts were surveyed pre and post program to assess their level of agreement with statements that spanned domains of self-awareness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with work and work environment. Pre and post responses were compared using McNemar's tests. Changes in scores across gender were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Mann-Whitney tests. LAMP participants were matched to nonparticipant controls by gender, rank, department, and time of hire to compare promotions in academic rank and departures from the organization. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine differences. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in almost all self-ratings on program surveys (p < 0.05). Greatest improvements were seen in ""understand the promotions process"" (36% vs. 94%), ""comfortable negotiating"" (35% vs. 74%), and ""time management"" (55% vs. 92%). There were no statistically significant differences in improvements by gender, however women faculty rated themselves lower on all pre-program items compared to men. There was significant difference found in time-to-next promotion (p = 0.003) between LAMP participants and controls.

Assessment of the Association of Leadership Behaviors of Supervising Physicians With Personal-Organizational Values Alignment Among Staff Physicians.,Shanafelt TD; Wang H; Leonard M; Hawn M; McKenna Q; Majzun R; Minor L; Trockel M,"IMPORTANCE: Although misalignment of values between physicians and their organization is associated with increased risk of burnout, actionable organizational factors that contribute to perceived values alignment are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the leadership behaviors of immediate supervisors and physicians' perception of personal-organizational values alignment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study of faculty physicians and physician leaders at Stanford University School of Medicine was conducted from April 1 to May 13, 2019. The survey included assessments of perceived personal-organizational values alignment, professional fulfillment, and burnout. Physicians also evaluated the leadership behaviors of their immediate supervisor (eg, division chief) using a standardized assessment. Data analysis was performed from May to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association between mean leadership behavior score (range, 0-10) of each supervisor and the mean personal-organizational values alignment scores (range, 0-12) for the physicians in their work unit. RESULTS: Of 1924 physicians eligible to participate, 1285 (67%) returned surveys. Among these, 651 (51%) were women and 729 (57%) were aged 40 years or older. Among the 117 physician leaders evaluated, 66 (56%) had their leadership behavior independently evaluated by at least 5 physicians and were included in analyses. The mean (SD) personal-organizational values alignment score on the 0 to 12 scale was 6.19 (3.21). As the proportion of work effort devoted to clinical care increased, values alignment scores decreased. Personal-organizational values alignment scores demonstrated an inverse correlation with burnout (r = -0.39; P < .001) and a positive correlation with professional fulfillment (r = 0.52; P < .001). The aggregate leader behavior score of the 66 leaders evaluated correlated with the mean values alignment score for physicians in their work unit (r = 0.53; P < .001). Aggregate leader behavior score was associated with 21.6% of the variation in personal-organizational values alignment scores between work units. After adjusting for age, gender, academic rank, work hours, physician-leader gender concordance, and time devoted to clinical care, each 1-point increase in leadership score of immediate supervisor was associated with a 0.56-point (95% CI, 0.46-0.66; P < .001) increase in personal-organizational values alignment score.

Reasons and remedies for under-representation of women in medical leadership roles: a qualitative study from Australia.,Bismark M; Morris J; Thomas L; Loh E; Phelps G; Dickinson H,"OBJECTIVE: To elicit medical leaders' views on reasons and remedies for the under-representation of women in medical leadership roles. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews with medical practitioners who work in medical leadership roles. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING: Public hospitals, private healthcare providers, professional colleges and associations and government organisations in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 30 medical practitioners who hold formal medical leadership roles. RESULTS: Despite dramatic increases in the entry of women into medicine in Australia, there remains a gross under-representation of women in formal, high-level medical leadership positions. The male-dominated nature of medical leadership in Australia was widely recognised by interviewees. A small number of interviewees viewed gender disparities in leadership roles as a 'natural' result of women's childrearing responsibilities. However, most interviewees believed that preventable gender-related barriers were impeding women's ability to achieve and thrive in medical leadership roles. Interviewees identified a range of potential barriers across three broad domains-perceptions of capability, capacity and credibility. As a counter to these, interviewees pointed to a range of benefits of women adopting these roles, and proposed a range of interventions that would support more women entering formal medical leadership roles. CONCLUSIONS: While women make up more than half of medical graduates in Australia today, significant barriers restrict their entry into formal medical leadership roles. These constraints have internalised, interpersonal and structural elements that can be addressed through a range of strategies for advancing the role of women in medical leadership.

Demographics and Fellowship Training of Residency Leadership in EM: A Descriptive Analysis.,Greenstein J; Hardy R; Chacko J; Husain A,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency medicine (EM) fellowships are becoming increasingly numerous, and there is a growing trend among EM residents to pursue postgraduate fellowship training. Scant data have been published on the prevalence of postgraduate training among emergency physicians. We aimed to describe the prevalence and regional variation of fellowships among EM residency leadership. METHODS: We conducted an online anonymous survey that was sent to the Council of EM Residency Directors (CORD) membership in October 2014. The survey was a brief questionnaire, which inquired about fellowship, secondary board certification, gender, and length in a leadership position of each member of its residency leadership. We separated the responses to the survey into four different geographic regions. The geographic regions were defined by the same classification used by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). We defined residency leadership as program director (PD), associate PD and assistant PD. Residencies that did not complete the survey were then individually contacted to encourage completion. The survey was initially piloted for ease of use and understanding of the questions with a select few EM PDs. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 145 of the 164 Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited EM residencies (88%). The fellowship prevalence among PDs, associate PDs, and assistant PDs was 21.4%, 20.3%, and 24.9% respectively. The most common fellowship completed was a fellowship in toxicology. Secondary board certification among PDs, associate PDs, and assistant PDs was 9.7%, 4.8%, and 2.9% respectively. Eighty-two percent of PDs have at least five years in residency leadership. Seventy-six percent of PDs were male, and there was a near-even split of gender among associate PDs and assistant PDs. The Western region had the highest percentage of fellowship and or secondary board certification among all levels of residency leadership. CONCLUSION: There is a low prevalence of fellowship training and secondary board certification among EM residency leadership, with the most common being toxicology. Assistant PDs, the majority of whom had less than five years residency leadership experience, had the highest percentage of fellowship training.

Building an Equitable Surgical Training Pipeline: Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES).,Santos-Parker JR; Santos-Parker KS; Caceres J; Vargas GM; Kwakye G; Englesbe MJ; Valbuena VSM,"OBJECTIVE: Underrepresented minority (URM) medical students face many educational challenges. Barriers include lack of equitable representation, scarce mentorship, and the effects of systemic racism. For students interested in diversity and health equity, perceptions of surgical culture may discourage pursuing surgical specialties. We describe a national pilot for a novel surgical pipeline program, Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES), which utilizes early exposure, mentorship, and community building to empower URM students in pursuit of academic surgical careers. DESIGN: A 4-week virtual program included pairing students with faculty research mentors, virtual skills sessions, and seminars on leadership, advocacy, and career development. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews before and after participation, assessing experiences with mentorship and research, interest in surgery, career aspirations, and perceived barriers to career goals. SETTING: Department of Surgery, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Rising second-year medical students. RESULTS: All 3 participants were Latinx; 2 were first-generation college students. Participants had no surgical mentorship and limited research exposure, citing a desire to learn research methodology, connect with mentors, and build towards a career working with underserved communities as motivating factors for participation. Perceived barriers to a surgical career included surgical culture, burnout, and lack of research expertise or academic network necessary for success. At completion of the program, participants described several themes: (1) new positive perspective on academic surgical culture, (2) interest and confidence in research, (3) hope for improving health disparities, (4) networking and longitudinal mentorship connections contributing to a sense of surgical community, and (5) eagerness to share resources with colleagues at their home institutions.

Perspectives From Students and Faculty on How Women Achieve Leadership Roles in Academic Medicine: An Exploratory Qualitative Study.,Chow CJ; Ferrel MN; Graham EM; Fix ML,"INTRODUCTION: The glass ceiling in academic medicine has resulted in lower pay and fewer career advancement opportunities for women. Creating change relies on preparing early-career women for positions of leadership, but most leadership programs focus on faculty, not trainees. The present exploratory qualitative study investigates how to prepare women medical students to be leaders in academic medicine. METHODS: Focus groups with medical students and faculty who identify as women were conducted at an academic medical center in the West. A total of 25 individuals (10 students and 15 faculty) participated. Recordings of focus groups were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis until saturation of themes was achieved. FINDINGS: Codes were organized into three themes: obstacles, support systems, and self-presentation. Obstacles identified included the subthemes microaggressions, macroaggressions, a lack of female role models in leadership, and personal characteristics such as the ability to self-promote and remain resilient. Support systems included sponsorship, allyship, mentorship, networking, and gender-specific role modeling subthemes. Self-presentation involved learning behaviors for demonstrating leadership and exuding confidence, being strategic about career moves, resiliency, and navigating social norms. CONCLUSIONS: The key themes of obstacles, support systems, and self-presentation are targets for systemic and individualistic improvement in leadership development.",2024,Apr,Cureus,16,4,e57969,,10.7759/cureus.57969,38738081,#119,Chow 2024,"",""
Leadership aspirations among residents in obstetrics and gynecology in the United States: a cross-sectional analysis.,Bavan B; Chavez J; Saravanabavanandhan B; Li J; MacLaughlan David S,"BACKGROUND: Most residents and faculty in obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) are women. However, only a third of Ob/Gyn academic leadership positions are held by women in the United States. METHODS: This is an IRB-approved cross-sectional study of leadership aspirations among Ob/Gyn residents in the U.S. as related to gender and mentorship using an electronic survey distributed nationwide in 2017. The primary outcome was resident interest in academic leadership. Mediator variables included demographics and training environment characteristics. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were performed using SPSS. RESULTS: We received 202 completed surveys, for a representative cross-section of 4% of all Ob/Gyn residents in the U.S. The majority (86%) of respondents were women (n = 174), reflecting the same gender distribution of all Ob/Gyn residents in training. Sixty-seven percent of all respondents reported an interest in pursuing academic leadership (n = 133). Women reported leadership aspirations less often than men (64% vs 86%, p < 0.05) and reported lower mean Likert scores (3.73 vs 4.14, p < 0.05) regarding interest in leadership. A marginal difference between mean Likert scores was observed between women and men when controlled for other demographics (coefficient - 0.344, SE 0.186; p = 0.066). No difference in leadership aspirations was noted between women and men when controlled for mentorship, presence of female program director, and presence of three or more female leaders in a program. CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparity in goal-setting toward leadership is identified as early as residency training in Ob/Gyn. This imbalance in leadership aspirations can be addressed with targeted mentorship.",2019,Sep,BMC Med Educ,19,1,332,,10.1186/s12909-019-1757-x,31484518,#120,Bavan 2019,"",""

METHODS: Data from the institution's Faculty Campus Climate Survey (n = 260 female faculty) were coupled with qualitative interviews (n = 14) of females in leadership positions, exploring campus climate, and institutional policies and practices aimed at advancing women. RESULTS: Two-thirds (59%) of the female faculty respondents indicated witnessing sexual harassment and 28% reported experiencing sexual harassment. Several organizational themes emerged to address this problem: culture, including cultural change, transparency, and accountability. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal the ways in which university culture mimics the larger societal context. At the same time, the distinct culture of higher education processes for recruitment, career advancement - specifically tenure and promotion - are identified as important factors that require modifications in support of reductions in gender inequalities.",2019,,Glob Health Epidemiol Genom,4,,e6,,10.1017/gheg.2019.5,31523439,#121,Evans 2019,"",""
"""I consider myself to be a leader"": a qualitative exploration of early career women family physicians' intentions to assume a leadership role.",Koempel A; Filippi MK; Byrd M; Siddiqi A; Bazemore A; Jabbarpour Y,"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing presence of women in US medical schools over the past 25 years, gender equity in medical leadership remains elusive. This qualitative study delves deeper into definitions of institutional leadership roles, who they are designed for, and how women currently contribute in unrecognized and uncompensated leadership positions. METHODS: We recruited family physicians who responded to the American Board of Family Medicine 2022 or 2023 graduate survey. We developed a semistructured interview guide following a modified life history approach to uncover women's experiences through the stages from residency to workforce. A qualitative researcher used Zoom to interview 25 geographically and racially diverse early career women physicians. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed utilizing NVivo software following an Inductive Content Analysis approach. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data. First, the nature of institutionally recognized leadership positions was largely perceived as bureaucratic and disciplinary, which did not appeal to most participants. Second, women engaged in leadership roles that increased practice efficiency, improved working conditions, and added to their emotional labor-without remuneration. Third, women experienced a tension between work and family, but this did not impact their long-term career goals-which remained focused on patient care or lower-level leadership positions. CONCLUSION: Increasing the number of women in leadership positions can be achieved through innovative leadership models that prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and work-life balance. Organizations must revise definitions of leadership to expand it to include the valuable, unrewarded work women undertake that advance their goals and overall patient health.",2024,Dec,Fam Pract,,,,,10.1093/fampra/cmae070,39656825,#122,Koempel 2024,"",""
"Women and the Decision to Leave, Linger, or Lean In: Predictors of Intent to Leave and Aspirations to Leadership and Advancement in Academic Medicine.",Ellinas EH; Fouad N; Byars-Winston A,"BACKGROUND: The Association of American Medical Colleges reports continued low rates of female faculty as professors and in leadership positions. While attrition and discrimination have both been proposed as explanations, recent literature has suggested that women's professional motivations, ingrained behavior, and perceptions of organizational support may also play a role. METHODS: The authors employed a series of scales informed by the turnover theory (which predicts intent to leave an organization), previously validated and used in business and engineering studies, but rarely used in academic medicine. The authors proposed and tested a multiple regression model to assess predictors (role strain, work-life balance, and organizational climate) for three outcome variables: seeking promotion, seeking leadership, and intent to leave. RESULTS: Survey results from 614 faculty members indicated that gender significantly influenced both promotion and leadership seeking, but not intent to leave. Perceived work-family conflict was negatively correlated with leadership seeking for women, but not for men. Positive views of organizational support and commitment were associated with promotion seeking and persistence for all participants. Role strain was positively correlated with desire for promotion and leadership, as well as with intent to leave. CONCLUSIONS: Female faculty may not be leaning in to promotion and leadership roles because of increased role conflict, work-life concerns, and organizational factors; this seems to be more of a factor for female clinical rather than research faculty. Work-family conflict affects male and female faculty differently and should be addressed in efforts to retain faculty and to remove barriers for female faculty seeking leadership opportunities.",2018,Mar,J Womens Health (Larchmt),27,3,324-332,,10.1089/jwh.2017.6457,29048981,#123,Ellinas 2018,"",""
The Demographics and Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society Membership Status of Surgery's Top Leadership.,Naaseh A; Tohmasi S; Stamos MJ; Jafari MD,"PURPOSE: Diversity and equity are priorities of many academic Departments of Surgery (DoS). Induction into Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AOA) denotes academic excellence and can potentially propel an academic career. Research has demonstrated that underrepresented in medicine (URM) students are less likely to be elected to AOA. In this study, we aim to examine the Chairs in American departments of surgery to examine their gender, racial, and ethnic background and AOA membership status. METHOD: An anonymous survey was generated via REDCap and electronically sent to the Chair of Surgery at the top 75 DoS based on ""Reputation"" on Doximity Residency Navigator 2020-2021. Seven chairs with non-publicly accessible email addresses were excluded. RESULTS: Of the eligible chairs (N = 68), 38 (55.9%) completed the survey, of which 34 (89.5%) identified as men.

Trends in leadership at orthopaedic surgery sports medicine fellowships.,Schiller NC; Sama AJ; Spielman AF; Donnally Iii CJ; Schachner BI; Damodar DM; Dodson CC; Ciccotti MG,"BACKGROUND: Fellowship directors (FDs) in sports medicine influence the future of trainees in the field of orthopaedics. Understanding the characteristics these leaders share must be brought into focus. For all current sports medicine FDs, our group analyzed their demographic background, institutional training, and academic experience. AIM: To serve as a framework for those aspiring to achieve this position in orthopaedics and also identify opportunities to improve the position. METHODS: Fellowship programs were identified using both the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and the Arthroscopy Association of North America Sports Medicine Fellowship Directories. The demographic and educational background data for each FD was gathered via author review of current curriculum vitae (CVs). Any information that was unavailable on CV review was gathered from institutional biographies, Scopus Web of Science, and emailed questionnaires. To ensure the collection of as many data points as possible, fellowship program coordinators, orthopaedic department offices and FDs were directly contacted via phone if there was no response via email. Demographic information of interest included: Age, gender, ethnicity, residency/fellowship training, residency/fellowship graduation year, year hired by current institution, time since training completion until FD appointment, length in FD role, status as a team physician and H-index. RESULTS: Information was gathered for 82 FDs. Of these, 97.5% (n = 80) of the leadership were male; 84.15% (n = 69) were Caucasian, 7.32% (n = 6) were Asian-American, 2.44% (n = 2) were Hispanic and 2.44% (n = 2) were African American, and 3.66% (n = 3) were of another race or ethnicity. The mean age of current FDs was 56 years old (± 9.00 years), and the mean Scopus H-index was 23.49 (± 16.57). The mean calendar years for completion of residency and fellowship training were 1996 (± 15 years) and 1997 (± 9.51 years), respectively. The time since fellowship training completion until FD appointment was 9.77 years. 17.07% (n = 14) of FDs currently work at the same institution where they completed residency training; 21.95% (n = 18) of FDs work at the same institution where they completed fellowship training; and 6.10% (n = 5) work at the same institution where they completed both residency and fellowship training. Additionally, 69.5% (n = 57) are also team physicians at the professional and/or collegiate level. Of those that were found to currently serve as team physicians, 56.14% (n = 32) of them worked with professional sports teams, 29.82% (n = 17) with collegiate sports teams, and 14.04% (n = 8) with both professional and collegiate sports teams. Seven residency programs produced the greatest number of future FDs, included programs produced at least three future FDs. Seven fellowship programs produced the greatest number of future FDs, included programs produced at least four future FDs. Eight FDs (9.75%) completed two fellowships and three FDs (3.66%) finished three fellowships. Three FDs (3.66%) did not graduate from any fellowship training program. The Scopus H-indices for FDs are displayed as ranges that include 1 to 15 (31.71%, n = 26), 15 to 30 (34.15%, n = 28), 30 to 45 (20.73%, n = 17), 45 to 60 (6.10%, n = 5) and 60 to 80 (3.66%, n = 3).

"Association of Burnout, Professional Fulfillment, and Self-care Practices of Physician Leaders With Their Independently Rated Leadership Effectiveness.",Shanafelt TD; Makowski MS; Wang H; Bohman B; Leonard M; Harrington RA; Minor L; Trockel M,"IMPORTANCE: Although leadership behavior of physician supervisors is associated with the occupational well-being of the physicians they supervise, the factors associated with leadership behaviors are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between burnout, professional fulfillment, and self-care practices of physician leaders and their independently assessed leadership behavior scores. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study of physicians and physician leaders at Stanford University School of Medicine (n = 1924) was conducted from April 1 to May 13, 2019. The survey included assessments of professional fulfillment, self-valuation, sleep-related impairment, and burnout. Physicians also rated the leadership behaviors of their immediate physician supervisors using a standardized assessment. Leaders' personal well-being metrics were paired with their leadership behavior scores as rated by the physicians they supervised. All assessment scores were converted to a standardized scale (range, 0-10). Data were analyzed from October 20, 2019, to March 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association between leaders' own well-being scores and their independently assessed leadership behavior. RESULTS: Of 1924 physicians invited to participate, 1285 (66.8%) returned surveys, including 67 of 117 physician leaders (57.3%). Among these respondents, 651 (50.7%) were women and 729 (56.7%) were 40 years or older. Among the 67 leaders, 57 (85.1%) had their leadership behaviors evaluated by at least 5 physicians (median, 11 [interquartile range, 9-15]) they supervised. Overall, 9.8% of the variation in leaders' aggregate leadership behavior scores was associated with their own degree of burnout. In models adjusted for age and sex, each 1-point increase in burnout score of the leaders was associated with a 0.19-point decrement in leadership behavior score (β = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.03; P = .02), whereas each 1-point increase in their professional fulfillment and self-valuation scores was associated with a 0.13-point (β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26; P = .03) and 0.15-point (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.29; P = .03) increase in leadership behavior score, respectively. Each 1-point increase in leaders' sleep-related impairment was associated with a 0.15-point increment in sleep-related impairment among those they supervised (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.29; P = .03). The associations between leaders' well-being scores in other dimensions and the corresponding well-being measures of those they supervised were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study, burnout, professional fulfillment, and self-care practices of physician leaders were associated with their independently assessed leadership effectiveness. Training, skill building, and support to improve leader well-being should be considered a dimension of leadership development rather than simply a dimension of self-care.",2020,Jun,JAMA Netw Open,3,6,e207961,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.7961,32543700,#126,Shanafelt 2020,"",""
"Silent Bias: Challenges, Obstacles, and Strategies for Leadership Development in Academic Medicine-Lessons From Oral Histories of Women Professors at the University of Kansas.",Pingleton SK; Jones EV; Rosolowski TA; Zimmerman MK,"PURPOSE: Despite dramatic increases in female learners and junior faculty, a significant gap remains in female leadership in academic medicine. To assess challenges and obstacles encountered, strategies for academic success, and lessons learned for leadership development, the authors conducted an in-depth study of women full professors. METHOD: The authors used a qualitative oral history approach, interviewing 87% of the cohort of female full professors at one Midwestern medical school in 2013 using a pretested, open-ended, semistructured interview guide. Interviews were videotaped and the audio recordings transcribed. Content was sorted into categories and key themes identified within each category. RESULTS: Participants described significant challenges: being treated with ""silent bias,"" ""being ignored,"" and being seen as an ""other."" Coping strategies included downplaying, keeping a distance, employing humor, and using symbols (e.g., white coat) to carefully present themselves. Explanations for success included intelligence, meritocracy, being even-tempered, and carefully constructing femininity. The participants recommended individual skills and actions to prepare for leadership development. Virtually all women could describe an individual mentor (sponsor), usually male, who provided essential assistance for their career success. At the same time, they stressed the importance of institutional support for diversity, especially with child care. CONCLUSIONS: Attaining ""full professor"" status is the pinnacle of academic success.

Through a Gender Lens: A View of Gender and Leadership Positions in a Department of Medicine.,Monroe AK; Levine RB; Clark JM; Bickel J; MacDonald SM; Resar LM,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing numbers in academic medicine, women remain underrepresented in top leadership positions. The objectives of this study were to characterize leadership positions held by department of medicine (DOM) faculty at all ranks at one Academic Health Center and to compare leadership positions held by male and female faculty. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey to collect information on all leadership positions from 16 divisions in the DOM at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in early 2012, including type of position, method used to fill the position, and financial compensation. Chi-square testing was used to compare leadership position characteristics by rank and gender. RESULTS: The study included 474 DOM faculty at the rank of instructor or higher; 38% were women. Of the 258 leadership positions identified, 35% were held by women. More leadership positions among assistant professors were held by women compared with men (56% of positions vs. 44%), with women assistant professors more likely to hold a leadership position than men (p=0.03). Numbers of women faculty declined at higher ranks, with leadership positions remaining proportionate to faculty representation. Most division director positions (88%) were held by men, and most leadership positions were compensated (89%) and appointed by the DOM chair or a division director (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Leadership positions held by women and men were proportionate to faculty representation, although the top leadership positions were held almost exclusively by men. While female assistant professors were more likely to hold leadership positions than male assistant professors, these positions appear to be low status positions and it is not clear that they contribute to professional advancement, as few women hold the rank of full professor.

Stanford Network for Advancement and Promotion: The impact of a community building-focused leadership development program on the success of underrepresented groups in academic medicine.,Fassiotto M; Jerome B; Stefanac L; Oaiya O; Quihuis G; Maldonado Y; Harris O,"BACKGROUND: Leadership can be an isolating experience and leaders from underrepresented groups (URGs) may experience even greater isolation and vulnerability because of lack of representation. Given the collaborative nature of medicine, leadership programs for physicians need to address isolation. Social support is one mechanism to combat this isolation; however, most leadership programs focus exclusively on skills building. PURPOSE: The Stanford Network for Advancement and Promotion (SNAP) program was developed to reduce isolation among physician leaders from URGs in academic medicine leadership by building a supportive network of peers. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Ten women physicians from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds were invited to participate in SNAP. Annual surveys were administered to participants to assess the effectiveness of SNAP on decreasing feelings of isolation and increasing professional leadership growth. The authors charted the expansion and adaptation of the program model across gender and in additional settings. RESULTS: SNAP effectively created a sense of community among the physician leaders. Participants also reported feeling challenged by the program and that they had grown in terms of critical thinking, organizational knowledge, and empowerment as leaders. Participants found community building to be the most valuable program component. Because of this success, the SNAP model has been adapted to create 10 additional cohorts.

Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and stepwise regression were used to analyze the results. The results indicate that job security is found to be at high level, whereas LEB and CSE are found to be at moderate levels among nurses. Significant positive relationships are found between CSE, LEB, and job security. Male nurses and medical/surgical floors reported higher levels of job security than female nurses and intensive care units.

Gender Representation Matters: Intervention to Solicit Medical Resident Input to Enable Equity in Leadership in Graduate Medical Education.,Klein R; Law K; Koch J,"PROBLEM: Gender equity in leadership across academic medicine remains a concern. The case of chief resident (CR) offers an opportunity to explore novel strategies in leadership selection in graduate medical education (GME). Means of identifying potential candidates for CR often rely on faculty assessment of resident performance, yet implicit gender bias has the potential to influence this assessment. APPROACH: To diversify the metrics used in CR selection, an intervention was implemented to solicit resident input to identify candidates for CR at 2 U.S. internal medicine residency programs in 2018 and 2019. This involved a simple, cross-sectional survey of residents in which they were asked to identify individual residents as good candidates for consideration for CR. OUTCOMES: There were 298 of 518 internal medicine resident responses to this intervention across sites and years (mean 58.2% response rate). Nomination patterns of residents and program leaders correlated significantly (correlation coefficient 0.62, P < .001). Controlling for site and year, gender was a significant factor associated with who residents nominated for CR (β-coefficient 0.325, P = .004) with women residents more likely to identify women for CR (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.73). Fifty residents nominated themselves for CR, and there was no significant difference by gender (β-coefficient 0.038, P = .91). NEXT STEPS: Soliciting resident input to identify candidates for CR may enable gender representation of candidates for this position.

Closing the gender leadership gap: a multi-centre cross-country comparison of women in management and leadership in academic health centres in the European Union.,Kuhlmann E; Ovseiko PV; Kurmeyer C; Gutiérrez-Lobos K; Steinböck S; von Knorring M; Buchan AM; Brommels M,"BACKGROUND: Women's participation in medicine and the need for gender equality in healthcare are increasingly recognised, yet little attention is paid to leadership and management positions in large publicly funded academic health centres. This study illustrates such a need, taking the case of four large European centres: Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Germany), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), Medizinische Universität Wien (Austria), and Oxford Academic Health Science Centre (United Kingdom). CASE: The percentage of female medical students and doctors in all four countries is now well within the 40-60% gender balance zone. Women are less well represented among specialists and remain significantly under-represented among senior doctors and full professors. All four centres have made progress in closing the gender leadership gap on boards and other top-level decision-making bodies, but a gender leadership gap remains relevant. The level of achieved gender balance varies significantly between the centres and largely mirrors country-specific welfare state models, with more equal gender relations in Sweden than in the other countries. Notably, there are also similar trends across countries and centres: gender inequality is stronger within academic enterprises than within hospital enterprises and stronger in middle management than at the top level. These novel findings reveal fissures in the 'glass ceiling' effects at top-level management, while the barriers for women shift to middle-level management and remain strong in academic positions. The uneven shifts in the leadership gap are highly relevant and have policy implications. CONCLUSION: Setting gender balance objectives exclusively for top-level decision-making bodies may not effectively promote a wider goal of gender equality. Academic health centres should pay greater attention to gender equality as an issue of organisational performance and good leadership at all levels of management, with particular attention to academic enterprises and newly created management structures. Developing comprehensive gender-sensitive health workforce monitoring systems and comparing progress across academic health centres in Europe could help to identify the gender leadership gap and utilise health human resources more effectively.",2017,Jan,Hum Resour Health,15,1,2,,10.1186/s12960-016-0175-y,28061790,#135,Kuhlmann 2017,"",""
Orthopedic Team Surgeons in Major Professional Sports: An Analysis of Affiliation With the Top 10 Sports Medicine Fellowship Programs and Implications for Leadership and Diversity.,Wood R; Perera J; Krumrey J; McCrum C,"This paper examines the correlation between orthopedic team surgeons in major professional sports and their affiliation with the top 10 sports medicine fellowship programs. With a growing trend in post-residency fellowship training, particularly in sports medicine, the study focuses on the implications of fellowship program choice for aspiring major professional sports team physicians. By analyzing data from Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL), the research reveals that 61 of 124 (49.19%) team surgeons graduated from the top 10 sports medicine fellowship programs. The results identify a noticeable pipeline effect in professional sports, where teams often hire graduates from a select number of esteemed fellowship programs. The study suggests that choosing a fellowship program from the top 10 list may enhance the prospects of becoming a major league team surgeon. Additionally, our results found a significant gender disparity among team surgeons, with only two (1.6%) of all major professional team physicians being women. This emphasizes the imperative for diversity improvement in orthopedic sports medicine. In conclusion, the research underscores the impact of top-tier fellowship programs on professional team surgeons, with implications for aspiring sports medicine physicians and a call for addressing gender disparities.",2024,Feb,Cureus,16,2,e54259,,10.7759/cureus.54259,38496168,#136,Wood 2024,"",""
"Women in Intensive Care study: a preliminary assessment of international data on female representation in the ICU physician workforce, leadership and academic positions.",Venkatesh B; Mehta S; Angus DC; Finfer S; Machado FR; Marshall J; Mitchell I; Peake S; Zimmerman JL,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing female enrolment into medical schools, persistent gender gaps exist in the physician workforce. There are limited published data on female representation in the critical care medicine workforce. METHODS: To obtain a global perspective, societies (n = 84; 79,834 members (40,363 physicians, 39,471 non-physicians)) registered with the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine were surveyed. Longitudinal data on female trainee and specialist positions between 2006-2017 were obtained from Australia and New Zealand. Data regarding leadership and academic faculty representation were also collected from national training bodies and other organisations of critical care medicine. RESULTS: Of the 84 societies, 23 had a registered membership of greater than 500 members. Responses were received from 27 societies (n = 55,996), mainly high-income countries, covering 70.1% of the membership. Amongst the physician workforce, the gender distribution was available from six (22%) participating societies-mean proportion of females 37 ± 11% (range 26-50%). Longitudinal data from Australia and New Zealand between 2006 and 2017 demonstrate rising proportions of female trainees and specialists. Female trainee and specialist numbers increased from 26 to 37% and from 13 to 22% respectively. Globally, female representation in leadership positions was presidencies of critical care organisations (0-41%), representation on critical care medicine boards and councils (8-50%) and faculty representation at symposia (7-34%). Significant gaps in knowledge exist: data from low and middle-income countries, the age distribution and the time taken to enter and complete training. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited information globally, available data suggest that females are under-represented in training programmes, specialist positions, academic faculty and leadership roles in intensive care. There are significant gaps in data on female participation in the critical care workforce.

"Limb Lengthening and Reconstruction Society orthopedic surgeons in the United States: An analysis of geographical distribution, academic, leadership, and demographic characteristics.",Hoveidaei AH; Niakan R; Hosseini-Asl SH; Annasamudram A; Conway JD,"BACKGROUND: The Limb Lengthening and Reconstruction Society (LLRS) is a premier orthopedic specialty organization that promotes limb reconstruction for all ages. LLRS membership characteristics, however, are poorly reported. This study delineates orthopedic surgeon LLRS members' demographic traits, academic achievement, leadership attainment, and geographical distribution across the United States. AIM: To inform aspiring orthopedic professionals, as well as to promote growth and diversity in both the LLRS organization and overarching field. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined United States LLRS members' academic, leadership, demographic, and geographical attributes. After reviewing the 2023 LLRS member directory, Google search results were matched to the listings and appended to the compiled data. Sex and ethnicity were evaluated visually utilizing retrieved images. The Hirsch index (H-index) of academic activity, residency and fellowship training, other graduate degrees, leadership positions, practice type (academic or non-academic), and spoken languages were categorized. LLRS members per state and capita determined geographic distribution. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare H-index between males and females, as well as to assess member differences pertaining to affiliation with academic vs non-academic practice facilities. RESULTS: The study included 101 orthopedic surgeons, 78 (77.23%) Caucasian and 23 (22.77%) non-Caucasian, 79 (78.22%) male and 22 (21.78%) female. Surgeons with DO degrees comprised only 3.96% (4) of the cohort, while the vast majority held MDs [96.04% (97)]. Mean H-index was 10.55, with male surgeons having a significantly higher score (P = 0.002). Most orthopedic surgeons (88.12%,) practiced in academic centers. Of those professionals who occupied leadership positions, 14% were women, while 86% were men. Additionally, 19 (37.25%) United States regions and the District of Columbia lacked an LLRS-member orthopedic surgeon. Total per capita rate across the United States was 0.30 LLRS orthopedic surgeons per 1 million people. CONCLUSION: Over 21% of LLRS members are women, surpassing prior benchmarks noted in orthopedic faculty reporting. LLRS members' high research productivity scores imply field dedication that can refine expertise in the limb lengthening and reconstruction space. Gender disparities in leadership remain, however, necessitating greater equity efforts. A low rate of LLRS representation per capita must be addressed geographically as well, to affect improvements in regional care access.

Chair Versus Chairman: Does Orthopaedics Use the Gendered Term More Than Other Specialties?,Peck CJ; Schmidt SJ; Latimore DA; O'Connor MI,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedics is the least gender-diverse medical specialty. Research suggests that the use of gendered language can contribute to workforce disparity and that gender-neutral language supports the inclusion and advancement of women, but the degree to which gender-neutral language is used by academic departments in what typically is a department's highest position (department chair) has not been characterized. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is the proportion of department websites that use the term chairman (as opposed to chair) greater in orthopaedics than in five other surgical and medical specialties? (2) Are departments led by chairs who are women less likely to use ""chairman"" than those led by men, and does this vary by specialty? METHODS: Seven hundred fourteen official websites of orthopaedic, neurosurgery, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology departments affiliated with 129 allopathic medical schools were screened. Any use of the term chairman on title pages, welcome messages, and faculty profile pages was identified using a Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm and terms were classified based on their location on the site. The overall use of the term chairman was compared by specialty and gender of the chair. RESULTS: Sixty percent of orthopaedic department websites (71 of 119) used the term chairman at least once, a proportion higher than that of pediatrics (36% [46 of 128]; OR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.63; p < 0.001), internal medicine (31% [38 of 122]; OR 0.030; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.53; p < 0.001), and obstetrics and gynecology (29% [37 of 126]; OR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.48; p < 0.001), but no different than that of neurosurgery (57% [54 of 94]; OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.6; p = 0.74) and general surgery (55% [69 of 125]; OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.4; p = 0.48). Across disciplines, departments whose chairs were women were much less likely to use the term chairman than departments whose chairs were men (14% [17 of 122] versus 50% [297 of 592]; OR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.28; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequent use of the term chairman in orthopaedics, coupled with the preference of women to use the term chair, suggests considerable room for growth in the use of gender-equal language in orthopaedics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our current efforts to increase the number of women in orthopaedics may be undermined by gendered language, which can create and reinforce gendered culture in the field. Electing to use gender-neutral leadership titles, while a relatively small step in the pursuit of a more gender-equal environment, presents an immediate and no-cost way to support a more inclusive culture and counteract unconscious gender bias. Future studies should explore the individual attitudes of chairs regarding the use of gendered titles and identify additional ways in which biases may manifest; for example, the use of gendered language in interpersonal communications and the presence of unconscious bias in leadership evaluations. Continued efforts to understand implicit bias in orthopaedics can guide actionable strategies for counteracting gendered stereotypes of the specialty, in turn aiding initiatives to recruit and promote women in the field.",2020,Jul,Clin Orthop Relat Res,478,7,1583-1589,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000000964,31567285,#139,Peck 2020,"",""
Learning outcomes of leader and leadership development: Method of Soft and Female leadership (SFL) empirical framework for driving the gender equality change in Mediterranean Engineering Education.,Zabaniotou A,"The foundation of gender equality was built some decades ago, but higher education institutions are far from achieving it. Perhaps the leadership needs to integrate new narratives for a greater commitment especially in engineering, and new tools for the existing toolbox. This study aims to share the outcomes of soft female leadership framework (SFL) development for gender equality at the RMEI network, entailing the commitment of top-managers from engineering schools, creation of new leaders to lead the change at their institutions, students acting as change-agents, and an active community of practice. The SFL toolbox comprises self-awareness, humanistic care, intuition, creativity, and trust. The transformation of mindset, skillset, and culture entails using Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 'Systemic View of Life' arguments, and drawing knowledge from organizational learning frameworks, scientific phenomena, and mechanisms, such as a) 4I-Intuiting-Interpreting-Integrating-Institutionalizing organizational learning process starting from intuition to achieve an institutional change; b) 'Stigmergy' scientific mechanism of self-organized collective schemes with coordinated actions and interactions, in which the action performed by an agent leaves a trace in the environment that stimulates subsequent actions; c) 'Spillover' phenomenon advocating that the behavior of an agent can bring the adoption of related behaviors by other agents. The RMEI gender equality plan (GEP) was evaluated by the HORIZON2020 TARGET project consortium. The SFL excelled as successful in setting goals, articulating a policy that integrates systems approach frameworks, insights from science and technology, innovation, ecology, philosophy, self-awareness, ethics, and values. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted physical meetings, but the process of change was not ceased at the network because we disrupted the disruption by boosting collaborative knowledge, consolidation and dissemination processes. The SFL framework integrates context, regional, and temporal characteristics, alongside cognitive, affective, and motivational outcomes over behavioral outcomes, new mindsets beyond organizational skills, and collaborative learning over individual learning.",2021,,Open Res Eur,1,,63,,10.12688/openreseurope.13340.2,37645143,#140,Zabaniotou 2021,"",""
Laptop use and muscle activity in adult females: Ground sitting has lower muscular demand than using a chair.,Rafiee M; Mokhtarinia HR; Parsons D; Hosseinpouri M; Gabel CP,"BACKGROUND: With progressing technology in the portable computing field, laptops are now integral for work, home and social settings. Different working postures adopted by laptop users impose different loads on the relevant muscles, which can be associated with musculoskeletal discomfort in the various body regions. Some Arabic and Asian cultures adopted postures are not well investigated, particularly for the 20-30 years age-group. OBJECTIVE: This study compared muscle activity in the cervical spine, arm, and wrist among different laptop workstation setups. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 23 healthy female university students (age = 24.2±2.28 years, range 20-26 years) performed a standardized 10 minute typing task in four different laptop workstation setups: DESK, SOFA, GROUND sitting with back support, and laptop table (LAP-Tab). Differences between electromyography (EMG) muscle activity recorded in the trapezius (TR), cervical extensors (CE), deltoid (DEL), and wrist extensors (WE) were determined using one-way repeated ANOVA measures with a post-hoc Bonferroni test. RESULTS: Significantly higher muscle activity was observed respectively in the workstations of DESK > LAP-Tab > SOFA > GROUND. Significant differences were found between WE muscle activity and the three other muscle groups (p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between workstations and muscle activity (F(9,264) = 3.81, p < 0.001, = 0.11), where the WE and DEL muscles showed respectively higher and lower muscle activity in all setups. CONCLUSION: Muscles showed variable activity in different workstations such that the GROUND workstation provided the minimum load, while the DESK workstation showed the maximum load on the measured muscle groups. These findings require further investigation in different cultural and gender specific groups.",2023,,Work,76,3,1113-1123,,10.3233/WOR-220473,37212082,#141,Rafiee 2023,"",""
"No Room to ""Lean In"": A Qualitative Study on Gendered Barriers to Promotion and Leadership.",Ellinas EH; Kaljo K; Patitucci TN; Novalija J; Byars-Winston A; Fouad NA,"INTRODUCTION: The gender gap in professorship and leadership roles persists in academic medicine, whereas reasons for these disparities remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Open-ended text responses to a 2013 faculty engagement survey were analyzed by using the grounded theory and consensual qualitative analysis techniques. The authors grouped 491 faculty's text responses into descriptive codes and three themes: (1) No Obstacles, (2) Barriers to Success, and (3) Concerns Regarding Processes. Demographics of codes were compared by using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Male faculty identified barriers that included negative views of leadership or leaders. Female faculty, especially those in clinical roles, expressed barriers related to role overload, including that the demands of their current positions prevented advancement or addition of further roles, no matter how desirable further roles may be. Women also shared that considerable self-promotion was required to receive acknowledgement of their work and support by leadership. CONCLUSION: A proposed framework depicts male and female faculty's concerns on a continuum. No Obstacle and Process Concerns were relatively gender neutral, whereas large gender disparities occurred within the Barriers to Success theme. Women's barriers largely revolved around internal obstacles (I can't do any more), and men's barriers largely revolved around external factors (leaders are impeding my progress).

Lessons learned from the initial 4 years of the SBM Mid-Career Leadership Institute.,Fitzgibbon ML; Rutten LJ; Yaroch A; Peterson C,"In 2015, the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) created the Mid-Career Leadership Institute. The initial model that motivated the creation of the institute came from my participation in the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program, specifically designed to enhance the leadership skills of senior female faculty in the health sciences. My participation in ELAM was transformative. It led me to run for president of SBM in 2014, to consider how behavioral scientists could similarly benefit from mid-career leadership training, and ultimately to work with the SBM Executive Director, the SBM Leadership Institute Steering Committee, and leadership training professionals to launch the Leadership Institute in 2016. The overarching goal of the SBM Leadership Institute is to train mid-career behavioral scientists engaged in academic and health care settings to develop essential skills needed to navigate the unique challenges of mid-career. Central to this goal is a focus on integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into their emerging leadership roles through participation in training exercises, lectures, and dynamic group discussions. To optimize the Leadership Institute experience, opportunities were developed, including mentoring from SBM seasoned members, peer mentoring through the creation of ""learning communities,"" career coaching, and additional networking opportunities.

Where is the patient's chair? Differences in general practitioner consultation room layouts - an exploratory questionnaire.,Floss M; Hoedebecke K; Vidal-Alaball J,"BACKGROUND: Consultation room design varies from country to country. The layout of a general practitioner's (GP's) consulting room may influence the physician's or patient's experience. The aim of this study is to explore and investigate the layout of GP's consulting rooms around the world and to describe any significant differences. METHODS: Between 3rd July and 2nd August 2018, an internet-based questionnaire on Google Docs was distributed by email, social media and WhatsApp platforms to several worldwide rural medicine groups.  Analysis of an internet-based questionnaire to explore possible layouts of consultation rooms within practices was performed. The questionnaire was designed with three distinct sections: first, a GP demographic profile including gender, year of graduation from medical school, country of graduation, and type of practice (private or public); second, questions relating to the office layout; third, a section for questionnaire feedback.   Results: 502 responses to the questionnaire were received; 65.3% women and 34.7% men.  The most common layout in Europe and America was where the physician and the patient were separated by a desk. The layout where the physician and the patient had a 90º angle facing each other was the most commonly used layout in Asia-Pacific and Africa. For GPs who graduated before 1990 and between 1990-2010, the layout where the table was between the patient and physician was preferred. However, physicians graduating after 2010 preferred a layout with the physician and the patient with a 90º angle facing each other.

Impact of Collaborative Leadership in Dental School Team Clinics.,Tang WC; Kingsley K; Reinke R,"Dental students' ability to critique team performance in dental school team clinics is a key component of dental education. The aim of this study was to determine if students' perceptions of their team leaders' openness of communication, cooperative decision making, and well-defined goals were positively related to the students' improvement-oriented voice behavior and willingness to raise concerns in the clinical environment. This study used a voluntary 12-question survey, distributed via email to all 311 students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Dental Medicine after completion of the spring 2017 semester. Eighty-seven students responded, for a response rate of 28%. Responses were stratified by team, class year, and gender, and the quantitative distribution of answers to each question was correlated with each other. Team leader collaborative qualities, which included openness for communication, cooperative decision making, and well-defined goals, were found to have a significant positive relationship with students' willingness to both raise concerns and make suggestions. Additionally, when measured by class year and gender, team differences in voice behavior assessment by students across the teams were found to be independent of class year, and no significant differences were found by gender. These results suggested that, to maintain high levels of communication, proper reporting of concerns, and a high standard of care, dental schools should encourage team leaders to enhance their capacity to present active collaborative behaviors in the school's clinic.

What's in a Word? Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Leadership Language in Anesthesiology Resident Feedback.,Arkin N; Lai C; Kiwakyou LM; Lochbaum GM; Shafer A; Howard SK; Mariano ER; Fassiotto M,"BACKGROUND: Individuals who have agentic traits (eg, assertive, confident, competent) that are more commonly associated with men are often selected for leadership roles. For women, this poses a potential barrier to entry into the higher ranks of academic medicine. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed anesthesiology resident feedback for differences in the use of agentic descriptors using qualitative and quantitative methods based on resident gender and year of training. METHODS: This study uses textual analysis of 435 assessments of residents over a 1-year period within a single residency program. We performed a qualitative content analysis on the words used in resident feedback and performed negative binomial regression analyses to determine significant differences in the way residents were described based on gender and year of training. RESULTS: Female residents were less likely than male residents to be described as agentic after controlling for excerpt length, year of training, and evaluator variability (β = -0.347; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.666, -0.028; P = .033). Senior residents were more likely to be described as agentic (β = 0.702; 95% CI 0.402-1.002; P < .001) compared to junior residents. The increased number of agentic codes among senior residents was driven by increased agentic description of female residents' ratings in the senior cohort (β = 0.704; 95% CI 0.084-1.324; P = .026).

You Want to be a Surgical Leader? Consider Training Elsewhere - An Observation of How Training Background May Impact Leadership Selection.,Parks MA; Gaskins JT; Jin A; Galandiuk S; Kavalukas SL,"OBJECTIVE: The significance of thought differences has always held importance in medicine, but it could be considered as increasingly acknowledged and valued to a greater extent in recent times as more emphasis is placed on diversity, equity, and inclusion. These unique perspectives have been examined according to race, gender, and ethnicity, but there is limited published data examining the prevalence of leadership roles within surgical departments in terms of training background. Our main objective is to identify trends in surgical leaders' education, and emphasize training diversity in surgical leadership. DESIGN: A descriptive study of the training background of all surgical academic leaders. SETTING: This internet search was performed at a tertiary care, academic medical center.

There was a mean of 7.6 leaders per institute examined: total 939 positions (119 chairs, 704 division directors, 116 program directors). 90/119 (76%) of the Chairs led at institutions outside of the places they completed their training. 4/119 (3%) did all their training at the same institution they chaired. 25/119 (21%) completed at least some but not all their training there, and later rose to the role of Chair. Among division directors, 217/704 (31%) did some training at that institution, and program directors were significantly more likely to have completed some training at their current institute (53/116, 46%; p = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences when examined geographically. Women made up 18% of the leaders and were significantly more likely to lead as program director rather than a chair or division director (p < 0.001).

Competencies necessary for becoming a leader in the field of community medicine: a Japanese qualitative interview study.,Kainuma M; Kikukawa M; Nagata M; Yoshida M,"OBJECTIVES: To clarify competencies for inclusion in our curriculum that focuses on developing leaders in community medicine. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: All six regions of Japan, including urban and rural areas. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen doctors (male: 18, female: 1) who play an important leadership role in their communities participated in semistructured interviews (mean age 48.3 years, range 34-59; mean years of clinical experience 23.1 years, range 9-31). METHOD: Semistructured interviews were held and transcripts were independently analysed and coded by the first two authors. The third and fourth authors discussed and agreed or disagreed with the results to give a consensus agreement. Doctors were recruited by maximum variation sampling until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Six themes emerged: (1)'Medical ability': includes psychological issues and difficult cases in addition to basic medical problems. High medical ability gives confidence to other medical professionals. (2)'Long term perspective': the ability to develop a long-term, comprehensive vision and to continuously work to achieve the vision. Cultivation of future generations of doctors is included. (3) 'Team building':the ability to drive forward programmes that include residents and local government workers, to elucidate a vision, to communicate and to accept other medical professionals. (4)'Ability to negotiate': the ability to negotiate with others to ensure that programmes and visions progress smoothly (5) 'Management ability': the ability to run a clinic, medical unit or medical association.

Gender Gap in Academic Surgery: Disparities in Early-Career Scholarly Productivity Sets the Stage for Unequal Academic Advancement,Kim G.; ; Goodman E.; Adams A.; Skendelas J.; Ward J.; Wang F.; Lu S.-E.; In H.,"Introduction: Gender disparities exist in academic surgery despite advances in the field. This study aimed to examine the extent of gender disparities in career advancement and promotion among academic faculty in surgery and understand the influence of academic productivity. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Cross-sectional study using publicly available information from online faculty profiles of 18 large academic US general surgery residency programs. Gender equality was examined overall and as subgroups by career stage (late-, mid-, and early-career) to account for differences over time. Logistic regression identified factors associated with gender disparities. Mediation analysis examined if the gender difference in academic advancement was mediated by academic productivity. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 1467 faculty members, 388 (26.4%) were women. Gender disparity in academic advancement was observed in the early-career cohort (33.4% versus 23.8%, P = 0.006). Women in the early-career cohort were nearly 40% less likely to achieve academic advancement (odds ratio 0.62 [95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88]) and more than 50% less likely to have >30 publications (odds ratio 0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.32-0.63]) than men. The effect of gender was no longer significant once publication volume and fellowship training was incorporated into the model on multivariable regression. Mediation analysis showed that >30 publications mediated nearly 67% of the effect of gender on academic advancement in the early-career cohort. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The gender gap in academic advancement for early-career faculty can partially be explained by the lower number of publications produced by women faculty.

Gender disparity among top North American medical schools and their affiliated radiology departments: Medical school vs Radiology - Gender Diverse?,Ahmadi S.; ; Joarder I.; Rotter L.K.; Hussain M.; Yong-Hing C.J.; Smith S.E.; Khosa F.,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the degree of gender disparity in leadership positions at the top 25 medical schools in North America compared to their affiliated radiology departments. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The academic rank and leadership appointment of medical school and radiology faculty were obtained from publicly available official websites between June-November 2022. Gender was determined using self-identified pronouns on website biographies. Alternatively, gender API software was used. Finally, SCOPUS Elsevier was used to extract research output metrics including publication counts, citations, and h-indices. Statistical analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 software. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 2216 individuals across 25 medical schools were included in this study. 1301 (58.7 %) were part of the medical school and 915 (41.3 %) were part of the affiliated radiology departments.

Underrepresentation of International Medical Graduates in Academic Leadership in Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine,Wu Y.; ; Joshi S.,"Rationale: International medical graduates (IMGs) comprise around 25% of the healthcare workforce in the United States (US), filling a critical gap in the nation's healthcare delivery. In the specialty of pulmonary disease and critical care medicine (PCCM), these numbers are higher with IMGs, comprising 30-40% of the active workforce. Recent research has highlighted gender and minority gaps in academic leadership positions, but little is known about the representation of IMGs in leadership. In this observational study, we evaluate the representation of IMGs in PCCM fellowship leadership for the year 2023. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In August 2023, we conducted a search on the American Medical Association Residency & Fellowship Database (FREIDA) for Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine (IM) fellowships. Information about programs, categorized by geography and type (university-based or non-university-based, including community-based, military, or other), and program directors (PD) was extracted. PD data, including gender and degrees (American medical graduates (AMGs) or IMGs), were collected from hospital websites and online sources. We utilized Chi-squared analysis to evaluate associations, defining a significant p-value as <0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In August 2023, 202 PCCM programs were listed in FREIDA. Among PDs, 67% were AMGs (n=136) and 33% were IMGs (n=66). Females (34%, n=69) were outnumbered by male counterparts (66%, n=133). Female underrepresentation worsened further for IMG women (6.4%, n=13/202) compared to AMG women (27.7%, n=56/202) with statistical significance (p < 0.005). Among PDs of university-based programs (n=110), 76% were AMGs (n=84/110), of which 46% were women (n=39/84), and 24% were IMGs (n=26/110), of which 31% were women (n=8/26). Among PDs of non-university-based programs (n=92), 57% were AMGs (n=52/92), of which 33% were women (n=17/52), and 43% were IMGs (n=40/92), of which 13% were women (n=5/40). Notably, all program directors in New England were AMGs (100%). Males dominated as PDs in most regions, except in East South Central (60% female, n=6). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This observational study identifies underrepresentation of IMGs in PCCM fellowship leadership positions. This gap widens further in university-based programs. Some parts of the country have no IMGs in fellowship leadership. Concerningly, IMG women are even more underrepresented across the spectrum. Further research is necessary to assess the generalizability of these findings across various specialties and leadership levels.

ACADEMIC UROLOGY ENDOWMENTS AND LEADERSHIP ROLES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY MALE UROLOGISTS,Velez C.A.; ; Hacker E.C.; Grant R.; Hampson L.A.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Urology has historically been considered a male-dominated specialty. While women have been increasingly entering the field, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender equity within the specialty. In fact, a study published in 2023 reported female urologists composed just 10.9% of the urology workforce. The aim of this study is to evaluate gender differences in academic urology leadership roles by assessing the distribution of endowments and department chairs amongst male and female urologists. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): By leveraging the Accredited Listing of U.S. Urology Residency Programs published by the AUA from 2021 to 2023, we queried each individual academic urology program via their public website to analyze faculty members. Faculty members were categorized according to their gender, title, and distinguishments, including endowed positions and professorships. We then analyzed the proportion of leadership positions and professor roles according to gender using descriptive statistics and a Chi-Squared test. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 2,429 faculty members with an MD degree from 136 academic urology programs were included in this study. Of these faculty members, only 19.6% were female, compared to the majority of 80.3% identified as male. Out of the 637 full professor positions identified within these academic programs, only 10.52% were occupied by females, compared to 89.1% occupied by males. A total of 135 positions were identified as endowed or professorship distinguishments, with female urologists receiving just 8.15% of these. Finally, only 5.9% of the department chairs within academic urology are female, further highlighting the disproportionate share of leadership roles and distinguishments occupied by males compared to females within academic urology (p<0.0001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While female presence in urology has been increasing, female faculty members in academic urology still have proportionally fewer leadership roles and full professor positions compared to their male counterparts. Further analysis is needed to understand what factors are contributing to these differences.

Why so slow? The advancement of females in neurosurgery: a 30-year analysis,Muzyka L.; ; Chapman N.; Limoges N.; Durham S.R.,"OBJECTIVE: As gender parity in medicine improves, neurosurgery lags behind. In pediatric neurosurgery, considered the most ""female-friendly"" subspecialty, determining the extent to which gender disparity has evolved over time, and how it compares to other subspecialties, can serve as an important benchmark for neurosurgery altogether. This study analyzed gender parity across different neurosurgical and subspecialty training stages to understand how female representation varies with training level and leadership positions. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Data spanning from 1990 to 2023 were extracted from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), Accreditation Council for Pediatric Neurosurgical Fellowships (ACPNF), American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS), and American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery (ABPNS) databases and American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) subspecialty websites to examine the proportions of female-identifying trainees and neurosurgeons. Information regarding females in leadership roles was gathered from publicly available sources. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Over the last 30 years, the proportion of female medical school graduates increased from 34.0% in 1990 to 51.9% in 2023 (0.45 graduates/year, R2 = 0.813). Female neurosurgery residency applicants increased from 10.5% in 1990 to 27.9% in 2023 (0.48 applicants/year, R2 = 0.694). Female neurosurgical residents increased from 7.3% in 1990 to 23.7% in 2023 (0.46 residents/year, R2 = 0.909). Female neurosurgeons obtaining ABNS certification increased from 5.0% in 1990 to 17.0% in 2023 (0.23 surgeons/year, R2 = 0.476). Female pediatric neurosurgery fellows increased from 0.0% in 1990 to 25.0% in 2023 (0.74 applicants/year, R2 = 0.369). The number of females obtaining ABPNS certification increased at a rate of 0.42 surgeons/year (R2 = 0.067). In neurosurgical academic leadership, female representation remains low: Society of Neurological Surgeons presidents at 0.98%, AANS presidents at 3.3%, CNS presidents at 0.0%, and departmental chairs at 1.5%. In pediatric neurosurgery, only 10% of division chiefs at top US News & World Report children's hospitals are female. Only 13.3% of past presidents of the AANS/CNS Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery were female; all American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons presidents have been male. There are higher proportions of female directors within ABPNS (33%) and the ACPNF board (43%). Other subspecialties have comparable female leadership representation, with 5.3% in spine, 5.1% in cerebrovascular, 5.9% in tumor, and 14.3% in functional/stereotactic. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Despite encouraging growth in the number of females entering neurosurgery over the past 3 decades, there continues to be significant gender disparity that is most pronounced at advanced career stages-in both academic organized neurosurgery and pediatric neurosurgery. Pediatric neurosurgery, due to a separate fellowship accreditation and board certification, provides the most accurate view within the subspecialties. Because pediatric neurosurgery exhibits the lowest gender disparity among subspecialties, these findings suggest more pronounced female underrepresentation across the stages of other neurosurgical subspecialty trainings.",2024,/,Journal of neurosurgery.

Women bring a unique perspective to the practice of medicine; however, there is a persistent underrepresentation of women in the field of radiology. Female radiologists face distinct challenges associated with underrepresentation and significant gender disparities. There are several obstacles contributing to women's underrepresentation in radiology, including suboptimal exposure to radiology during training, misconceptions about the field of radiology, the impact of social media, and a lack of women in leadership positions. Additional factors leading to widening the gender gap were also discussed, such as a lack of role models and mentors, unconscious biases, and other societal barriers, including but not limited to childbearing, lactation, and family-building.

Women outnumber men in British schools. Most faculty positions were held by men. A 2022 AJS study revealed women held 25% faculty positions, 3% full professors, 4.4% associate professors, 13% assistant professors. Studies in transplant journals report deficiency in female leadership in decision making positions, holding just 1/3rd in transplantation. Women struggle to balance career and familial obligations. International labour office recommends maternity leave to reduce discrimination. In India women are granted 6 months maternity leave, a big step. In contrast after paternity leave, men in academia are more successful. In a global survey conducted by ILTS 8.2% leadership positions and 22% division chiefs were women across 856 liver transplant programs. TTS study revealed 29.7% of editorial board leaders, 11.8% of chief editor position were women. Oceania had 54.3% women editorial board leaders, while Middle East/Africa had 17.2%. ILTS has created Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee to gain understanding on the gender gap within the field.To reduce discrepancy TTS has created women in transplant. Data on Asian women leadership showed 14.7% of editorial leaders, 32.4% of transplantation organization leaders. ILTS reported 13.2% of the transplant centers as having one woman director or chief.

Mind the gap: Gender disparities in authorship in the Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences,Bolderston A.; ; McCuaig C.; Ghosh S.; McEntee M.F.; Kiely E.,"Introduction: Research studies tracking gender and academic publication productivity in healthcare find gender disparities in research activity, publication, and authorship. Article authorship is one of the important metrics to track when seeking to understand gender inequality in academic career advancement. Research on gender disparities in publication productivity in the field of Medical Radiation Science (MRS) is very limited thus this study analyses and explains potential gender differences in article authorship and acceptance for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences (JMIRS) for a 5-year period (2017-2021). <ovid:br/>Method(s): Gender was inferred based on the author's first name or title (e.g., Mr, Mrs or Ms). For those who left the title blank or reported as 'Dr' or 'Prof,' a series of steps were taken to identify their gender. Where gender was impossible to ascribe, these authors were excluded. Descriptive and inferential statistics are reported for the study population. Descriptive and inferential statistics are used. Percentages of females are reported, and males constitute the other portion. Chi-square, slope analysis and z-tests were used to test hypotheses. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results show that female authorship overall and in all categories of authorship placement (i.e., first, last and corresponding) increased over the timeframe reviewed. The percentage gain in the increase was higher than that for male authorship. However, male authorship started from a higher baseline in 2017 and has also increased year on year and overall, as well as in each placement category examined. More female authors were in the MRS sub-specialism Radiation Therapy (RT) than in the other MRS sub-specialisms. Analysis of the acceptance rate of articles with female authors shows a weak downward trend, and this may be related to higher submission and acceptance rates of articles by male authors during the same period. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Male authors are overrepresented in all categories, which raises questions about the persistence of gender disparities in JMIRS authorship and article acceptance. Positive trends in female authorship indicate progress, yet there is the persistence of the significant under-representation of women in the Medical Radiation Sciences workforce in academic publishing.

The annual proportion of women representation was compared to the thoracic surgery workforce. <ovid:br/>Result(s): During the study period, 558 individuals (3641 names) were identified, 14.3% of whom were women. The total number of editorial board women increased for both journals. The proportion of women also increased from 2.5% (3 out of 118) in 2008 to 17.8% (71 out of 399) in 2023 (P < .001), exceeding the percentage of women in the thoracic surgery workforce, which increased from 3.8% in 2007 to 8.3% in 2021 (P < .001). The average duration of participation was longer for men than for women (53.8 vs 44.5 months; P = .01). Women in editorial board senior roles also increased from 3.3% (1 out of 30) in 2008 to 28.6% (42 out of 147) in 2023 (P < .001), almost triple the increase in nondesignated roles from 2.3% (2 out of 88) in 2008 to 11.5% (29 out of 252) in 2023 (P < .001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In recent years, the appointment of women to the editorial boards of high-impact cardiothoracic surgery journals and senior roles have proportionally exceeded the overall representation of women in cardiothoracic surgery.

Gender distribution and NIH funding rank in dermatology leadership: a cross-sectional analysis,Viveiros M.D.; ; Awethe Z.; Kaffenberger J.,"In examining the influence of National Institute of Health (NIH) funding on gender distribution within dermatology leadership roles, a cross-sectional analysis of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited dermatology residencies was conducted. The gender of leadership faculty was verified using online resources, while institutions were categorized by their 2022 NIH dermatology funding status. Results revealed that male dermatologists predominantly occupied department chair roles, whereas female dermatologists were more frequently found in associate program director roles, regardless of funding status. Notably, women held most program director positions in the top NIH-funded group, though this difference was not statistically significant due to a smaller sample size. The overall gender distribution has shown progress from 2021, with a significant rise in female associate program directors and a narrowing gender gap for chairs and program directors. Despite NIH funding rank playing a minimal role in gender distribution, our study underscores positive strides towards gender equality in dermatology leadership. Further advocacy for gender balance and additional research on underlying factors are essential for continued progress.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2024,/,Archives of Dermatological Research,316,1,38,2027112868,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00403-023-02760-w,38085364,#174,Viveiros 2024,"",""

Methods A pre-established database of local and diaspora scientists was used, after adjustment and updating for otolaryngology. The following data were recorded: age, gender, academic rank, country of work, total citations and h-index of December 2022. Results A total of 276 Greek academic otolaryngologists were identified in the Scopus database. Of Greek otolaryngologists, 15.9 per cent are women. Of all academic otolaryngologists, 27.1 per cent have a university post, but only 4 per cent of them are women. There is an almost linear correlation between university post ranking and citations. Otolaryngologists based in Greece accounted for 3 out of the 10 most cited Greek otolaryngologists. Conclusion There are significant age, gender and location-related differences in academic output.

Does Sponsorship Promote Equity in Career Advancement in Academic Medicine? A Scoping Review,Schwartz R.; ; Williams M.F.; Feldman M.D.,"Sponsorship describes a set of actions wherein an influential champion (sponsor) uses their position to actively support a colleague's career by helping them gain visibility, recognition, and/or positions. There is growing awareness of the importance of sponsorship for career advancement in academic medicine, particularly for women and those who are historically underrepresented and excluded in medicine (UIM). This scoping review examines the current landscape of evidence, and knowledge gaps, on sponsorship as it relates to career advancement in academic medicine for women and UIM faculty. We searched peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS) over the past 50 years (from 1973 through July 2023). Sixteen studies were included in the final review. We found relative consensus on sponsorship definition and value to career advancement. Heterogeneity in study design limited our ability to directly compare study outcomes. All included studies focused on gender differences in sponsorship: two of four quantitative studies found men were more likely to receive sponsorship, one reported no gender differences, and one was insufficiently powered. All but one of the qualitative studies reported gender differences, with women less likely to access or be identified for sponsorship. The mixed-methods studies suggested sponsorship may vary by career stage. Only two studies analyzed sponsorship for UIM populations. The existing data are inconclusive regarding best ways to measure and assess sponsorship, what institutional support (e.g., structured programs, formal recognition, or incentives for sponsorship) should look like, and at what career stage sponsorship is most important. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critically important for understanding what sponsorship best practices, if any, should be used to promote equity in career advancement in academic medicine. We advocate for commitment at the institutional and national levels to develop new infrastructure for transparently and equitably supporting women and UIM in career advancement.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.",2024,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,39,3,470EP  - 480,2026974198,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08542-4,38055164,#177,Schwartz 2024,"",""
Commitment to inclusion: The importance of collaboration in gender equity work,Lee J.K.; ; Levine R.B.; Yousem D.M.; Faraday N.; Skarupski K.A.; Ishii M.; Daugherty Biddison E.L.; Oliva-Hemker M.,"Despite decades of faculty professional development programs created to prepare women for leadership, gender inequities persist in salary, promotion, and leadership roles. Indeed, men still earn more than women, are more likely than women to hold the rank of professor, and hold the vast majority of positions of power in academic medicine. Institutions demonstrate commitment to their faculty's growth by investing resources, including creating faculty development programs. These programs are essential to help prepare women to lead and navigate the highly matrixed, complex systems of academic medicine. However, data still show that women persistently lag behind men in their career advancement and salary. Clearly, training women to adapt to existing structures and norms alone is not sufficient. To effectively generate organizational change, leaders with power and resources must commit to gender equity. This article describes several efforts by the Office of Faculty in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to broaden inclusivity in collaborative work for gender equity.

Gender disparities in gastroenterology and hepatology conferences: The journey towards equality,Devi J.; ; Butt A.S.; Rai L.; Kumar J.; Memon S.,"Background: This study scrutinizes gender representation in invited faculty and conference committee leadership at key gastroenterology and hepatology conferences in Pakistan over five years, exploring the impact of the ""glass ceiling"" and ""sticky floor"" phenomena on gender diversity within academic medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and March of 2023. The three major national societies of gastroenterology and hepatology in Pakistan that had been established for more than 10 years and the scientific programs of their annual conferences, which were publicly accessible, were included and coded as Society 1, Society 2 and Society 3 to maintain anonymity. The scientific programs for the last five years (2018-2022) were retrieved. The roles of invited faculties were identified as invited speakers, moderators, chairs/panelists, presidents and chairs of organizing or scientific committees and the gender makeup of the faculty was compared. Regression analysis was used to evaluate the trends for female representation over time for each role. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Significant gender disparity was evident by an extremely lower cumulative proportion of female invited faculty compared to males (211 [11.9%] vs. 1567 [88.1%], p 0.001). The predominance of invited male faculty was observed across all societies as well as in various roles of invited faculty (p 0.01). A significant disparity has also been observed in leadership positions of all three societies (43 [95.5%] males vs. 2 [4.5%] females, p 0.001), while the trend of women's underrepresentation across all societies remained almost unchanged over time (slope = 0.08, R<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = - 0.078, p-value = 0.875). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study unveils striking gender disparities in women's representation as invited speakers and other roles at the annual scientific conferences of major gastroenterology and hepatology.

Leading beyond the Script: A Cross-Sectional Study Exploring Preparedness of Pharmacy Academic Administrators,Hall E.A.; ; Finch C.K.; March K.L.,"Limited research exists on the preparedness of pharmacy academic administrators for their roles. This cross-sectional survey aimed to explore the self-perceptions of pharmacy academic administrators, including deans, associate deans, assistant deans, department chairs, and directors, within United States-based Colleges or Schools of Pharmacy. Participants answered questions regarding their demographics, self-perceived readiness for administrative roles, self-perceived leadership skills, and strategies used to develop these skills. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and subgroup comparisons were made using Student's t-test for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney tests for ordinal variables or non-normally distributed continuous variables, and Chi-squared tests for nominal variables. A total of 193 responses were analyzed. Respondents reported feeling least prepared in two areas: entrepreneurial revenue and handling grievances and appeals. There were gender differences noted in preparedness to conduct performance reviews, manage unit finances, and develop entrepreneurial revenue, with men rating themselves significantly higher than women in all three areas. Despite high self-ratings of leadership skills in the overall cohort, significant gender differences were noted in micromanagement with men rating themselves lower than women. Seeking advice from senior colleagues was the most used development strategy, and women showed a significantly higher preference for programs facilitated by professional organizations. This study contributes valuable insights into the preparedness of pharmacy academic administrators to inform future strategies that better support individuals to be successful in their roles.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by the authors.",2024,/,Pharmacy,12,1,25,2028661786,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy12010025,,#182,Hall 2024,"",""
Closing the gender gap in medicine: the impact of a simulation-based confidence and negotiation course for women in graduate medical education,Bona A.; ; Ahmed R.; Falvo L.; Welch J.; Heniff M.; Cooper D.; Sarmiento E.; Hobgood C.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, 75-80% of the medical workforce worldwide consists of women. Yet, women comprise 21% of full professors and less than 20% of department chairs and medical school deans. Identified causes of gender disparities are multifactorial including work-life responsibilities, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, bias, lack of confidence, gender differences in negotiation and leadership emergence, and lack of mentorship, networking, and/or sponsorship. A promising intervention for the advancement of women faculty is the implementation of Career Development Programs (CDPs). Women physician CDP participants were shown to be promoted in rank at the same rate as men by year five, and more likely to remain in academics after eight years compared to both men and women counterparts. The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel, simulation-based, single-day CDP curriculum for upper-level women physician trainees to teach communication skills identified as contributing to medicine's gender advancement gap. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This was a pilot, pre/post study performed in a simulation center implementing a curriculum developed to educate women physicians on 5 identified communication skills recognized to potentially reduce the gender gap. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included confidence surveys, cognitive questionnaires, and performance action checklists for five workplace scenarios. Assessment data were analyzed using scored medians and descriptive statistics, applying Wilcoxon test estimation to compare pre- versus post-curriculum intervention scores, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Eleven residents and fellows participated in the curriculum. Confidence, knowledge, and performance improved significantly after completion of the program. Pre-confidence: 28 (19.0-31.0); Post-confidence: 41 (35.0-47.0); p < 0.0001. Pre-knowledge: 9.0 (6.0-11.00); Post knowledge: 13.0 (11.0-15.0); p < 0.0001. Pre-performance: 35.0 (16.0-52.0); Post-performance: 46.0 (37-53.00); p < 0.0001. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Overall, this study demonstrated the successful creation of a novel, condensed CDP curriculum based on 5 identified communication skills needed for women physician trainees. The post-curriculum assessment demonstrated improved confidence, knowledge, and performance. Ideally, all women medical trainees would have access to convenient, accessible, and affordable courses teaching these crucial communication skills to prepare them for careers in medicine to strive to reduce the gender gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

Perception of gender disparity in academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility,Selter J.H.; ; Moyett J.; Price T.,"The aim of this study was to identify gender differences in leadership/academic rank and attitudes regarding gender representation among academic Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility subspecialists. Members of the Society of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (SREI) were surveyed regarding gender, academic rank, and attitudes concerning gender disparity in academic medicine in March 2021. Univariate comparisons were performed using Chi-squared and Fischer-exact tests with significance at p <= 0.05. A total of 237 SREI members completed the survey with a response rate of 28.8%. Of those, 176 practiced in academic medicine. The majority (76.7%) have been in practice for greater than 10 years. The female-to-male ratio changed over time with ratios of 1.1:1 for those in practice over 10 years and 5.8:1 for those less than 10 years. Of providers in practice greater than 10 years, there were significantly more male vs. female full professors (72.3% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.01), less frequent male assistant professors (3% vs.17%, p < 0.01) and a similar percentage of male and female associate professors (24.6% vs. 34.3%, p = 0.2). Among those in practice for less than 10 years, there were no differences in academic rank between males and females.

The female-to-male ratio in academic REI has dramatically changed with time. Even with this shift, the majority of providers believe in a gender disparity regarding academic rank that is due to systemic factors limiting the academic advancement of females.

LEADING WITH PURPOSE: A LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN TRAINEES IN MEDICINE,Krishnan G.; ; Baggstrom M.Q.; Spencer A.; Mattar C.; Bhayani R.,"SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Despite near parity of women and men entering medical school, there is still marked gender inequity in academic medicine as reflected in leadership positions, promotion, assessments, and job opportunities. Awareness and engagement, mentoring and networking, and leadership development are valuable interventional strategies to advance women in medicine until systemic barriers have been addressed. Structured leadership development programs create safe space for learning, networking, enhanced leadership competencies and workplace retention. A group of 5 women leaders from different stages of academic medicine at Washington University (WUSM) developed a skill-based longitudinal leadership development program for women trainees in the Department of Medicine (DOM) for AY 2022- 2023. Through an application and selection process, 6 subspecialty fellows and 6 internal medicine residents within the DOM were selected to participate in this 8-month long certificate program that commenced Fall 2022 and concludes Spring 2023. DESCRIPTION: In-person sessions were held every 6 weeks and included topics such as finding meaning and purpose in medicine, communicating effectively, building your academic team for success, leadership and communication skills, creating your career development plan, negotiation, and conflict management. An active learning environment was created through small and large group discussions, self-reflection activities, and negotiation scenarios in the simulation center. Each participant was paired with a woman faculty mentor for the duration of the program to support goal-directed advancement. EVALUATION: In the pre-course survey only 42% (5/12) had primary mentors and 25% (3/12) had an individual career development plan. Using the Kirkpatrick framework for Levels of Program Evaluation, satisfaction with the program was assessed through post session surveys on the effectiveness of the speaker, satisfaction with the content delivery and pre/post assessment surveys to check knowledge acquisition and skills. At the end of the program, self-reflective survey questions combined with an observed role play will be implemented to demonstrate skill acquisition. We plan to disseminate impact surveys after program completion at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years to evaluate retention and implementation of new skills acquired. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Leadership Development courses provide vital skills to support the future women leaders in medicine reach their full potential. Role plays and simulation tests help practice and develop negotiation and communication skills. To create a sustainable program, we have obtained buy-in from key stakeholders such as the Department chair, Vice Chairs, and Program Directors. We have secured funding to provide meals during the evening sessions, administrative support to handle program logistics, and recorded sessions to accommodate varying trainee schedules.",2023,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,38,Supplement 2,S717,641879996,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z,,#207,Krishnan 2023,"",""
Gender and Racial Diversity Among Colon and Rectal Surgery Trainees and Leaders,Felton J.M.; ; Staub M.; Otegbeye E.; Kandagatla P.; Mirza K.; Mutch M.; Smith R.K.,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent changes in women and underrepresented minorities in medicine, there still exists large gender and racial gaps in surgical training and leadership. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): We hypothesize that gender and racial representation have improved among general and colorectal surgical trainees and leadership over the past 20 years. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study examines gender and racial representation of general and colorectal surgery residents, colorectal faculty members, and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Executive Council. SETTINGS: We extracted data from the Journal of the American Medical Association Graduate Medical Education yearly reports for information on surgical residents. We used the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons website and publicly available practice websites to obtain information regarding colon and rectal surgery residents, faculty members, and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Executive Council. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We primarily focused on the gender and underrepresented minority breakdowns of general surgery residents, colorectal surgery residents, and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Executive Council. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): We found that between 2001 and 2021, the number of women and people identifying as underrepresented minorities increased within general surgery programs. In addition, there has been a similar increase in underrepresented minorities and women entering colorectal surgery residency programs. Finally, there has been a steady, significant increase in women representation in the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Executive Council, with a slower increase in underrepresented minorities on the council.

"Gender Diversity of Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Fellowship Trainees, Faculty and Leadership",Gupta S.; ; Maginnis C.; Saraf S.; Wong S.; Mulcahey M.; Lavorgna T.,"Objectives: Orthopaedic surgery has remained the most male-dominated field in medicine, despite recent efforts to recruit and retain more women. The objective of this study was to determine the gender composition of fellows, faculty, and leaders within orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs to provide a more complete analysis of gender diversity within this subspecialty. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Official program websites of orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships listed on the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA) fellowship directory were examined. Data collected for analysis included the gender of program directors, fellowship faculty, orthopaedic surgery department faculty, current sports medicine fellows and fellows who graduated within the last five years. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In the academic year 2021-2022, 132 sports medicine fellows were in fellowship training in the United States within 97 programs.

Leadership Curriculum for Critical Care Medicine Fellows,Irons C.; ; Miller C.; Thati A.; Matta M.,"RATIONALE: Although leadership training in the critical care setting is not new, its critical importance became clear during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, where trainees needed to embrace a changing healthcare landscape, foster teamwork, and innovate in order to deliver quality patient care. In a national survey, 73% of program directors agreed that leadership education should be a mandatory part of fellowship training. However, 68% reported less than three hours of leadership training during all three years, often citing barriers such as a lack of time to develop/deliver material and lack of funding (1). The purpose of this project is to provide a formal and dedicated leadership curriculum for all fellows training in critical care medicine at our institution, recognizing that regardless of whether fellows desire leadership positions following training, all critical care physicians will be expected to lead. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a collaboration between our program and Weather head School of Management, we developed a leadership curriculum for critical care fellows. Topics include understanding self (learning styles, career anchors, developing a 5-10 year plan), managing teams (crisis leadership), and influencing the environment (women in leadership, diversity equity and inclusion). These sessions (didactics and small group format) were each one hour in duration and delivered over a six-month time span with zoom and in-person option. Participants for this study included critical care fellows from medicine, anesthesia, emergency medicine, and neurology programs. Faculty were also encouraged to attend and participate. A learning needs assessment, individual session assessment, and post-course survey were conducted. Long-term outcomes evaluating fellow participation in leadership positions after graduation are being collected. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Fifteen fellows completed the learning needs assessment, and ten out of fifteen fellows completed the post-course survey. There was an improvement in pre and post survey questions (figure 1). Following the course, 9/10 participants reported that they could imagine how their career would be 10 years after fellowship, and the majority of fellows felt adequately prepared to lead a team through the next pandemic. 9/10 participants felt prepared to address micro aggressions in the workplace. 100% of respondents reported the leadership curriculum was helpful to their career, and they would recommend repeating it. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The intensive care unit will continue to be directly affected by the changing landscape in healthcare, and equipping fellows to become leaders in a field constantly affected by this change will benefit the healthcare system as a whole.",2023,/,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,207,1,,641646805,https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2023.C23,,#210,Irons 2023,"",""

Perceptions of gender equity in pediatric academic leadership,Schulz E.; ; Ma T.; Wyatt T.; Maggio L.,"Purpose of Study: Fifty years after the phrase ""glass ceiling"" was coined, gender inequities persist in pediatric medicine leadership. Although current evidence indicates persistent gender inequity in academic leadership positions, the US military has equitable gender representation in leadership positions and guarantees pay equity. This study was designed to further understand how US military pediatricians in academic leadership roles came into these positions and how they have acquired perceived success in their career. Methods Used: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen uniformed men and women faculty in academic medicine leadership positions across seven graduate medical education (GME) sites. Using the social construction of gender as a theoretical framework, these interviews examined academic medicine leaders' perceptions on facilitators and barriers to their success, and were analyzed using Acker's theory of gendered organizations. Specifically, the datawere analyzed using the theory's five processes, which explain embedded gender roles within work environments. Summary of Results: Participants described several facilitators to their success, including the availability of mentorship/sponsorship, inclusive leadership, and early and persistent exposure to women leaders in GME training and beyond. However, unlike men, women frequently described encountering barriers to achieving equitable success. Participants' experiences can be understood within the existence of a pervasive ideology in academic medicine, which supports the notion of an ideal worker. Given that medicine's ideal worker was normed around the traditional roles of men, men observed and women experienced barriers to leadership success around issues related to childbearing and the return to work as well as male microaggressions directed at women. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Acker's five processes revealed that equitability for military pediatric GME leadership heavily relied upon structures and support created by former leaders and mentors. By isolating these variables within such a unique academic medicine context, we can not only understand these experiences to better support and facilitate equitable leadership roles for both genders in academic medicine but intentionally address known barriers.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.",2023,/,American Journal of the Medical Sciences,365,Supplement 1,S298,2022349202,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9629%2823%2900556-6,,#213,Schulz 2023,"",""
Using the British Council's comprehensive global 'Maximising Impacts' report to improve actions on gender equality and leadership in your institution,Mott H.L.; ,"Background Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is central to the work of the British Council as a cultural relations organisation that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion as core values. In March 2022, the British Council published a comprehensive global report on 'Gender Equality in Higher Education: Maximising Impacts' [1]. Methods Using the academic and grey literature, and interviews with practitioners around the world, this report asks the questions: what is the role of HE in transforming society in relation to women's equality and empowerment, and how is gender inequality reflected, reinforced and challenged worldwide? Results For the first time, research and best practice from around the world that addresses the multiple manifestations of gender inequality in higher education has been collated together into one research document. Gender inequality is manifested from subject selection to the curriculum, teaching and learning environments, in research and innovation, and in the threat and reality of violence against women staff and students. Men as a group remain advantaged at every stage of their academic careers. This report highlights research data, searchable by country and region, across multiple areas. The importance of intersectionality, compounded disadvantage and taking a lifecycle approach, are highlighted. Seventeen case studies - including Athena Swan - examine successful programmes and interventions, some dedicated to gender equality and others seeking to mainstream it, from policies and frameworks to actions with individual students or teachers. The report provides a compendium of resources and examples to help with gender mainstreaming, covering policy and systems development; institutional partnerships; professional development; student mobility; insight, analysis and advocacy. The resources include suggestions for gender- focused activities and for how to monitor and evaluate. Conclusions In order to maximise impacts for gender equality the following recommendations are made: 1) prioritise gender mainstreaming; 2) develop gender expertise; 3) ensure an intersectional approach; 4) put a greater focus on violence against women; 5) address women's under-representation in HE leadership; 6) tackle subject segregation, particularly in STEM; 7) take a gendered approach to online learning and collaboration; 8) strengthen organisational leadership and commitment to address gender inequality in strategy, policy, quality assurance and delivery; 9) recognise and promote gender studies and women's higher education institutions; 10) take a lifecycle approach; 11) assert the centrality of equality and inclusion to the definition of quality and excellence in higher education; 12) act at scale.

Gender Differences of Endowed Professorship in Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments at Top Academic Institutions,Burns C.J.; ; Russell C.B.; Griffith K.A.; Mangurian C.; Johnson T.R.B.; Jagsi R.,"Background: Gender equity is a critical issue in academic medicine. Whether there is equitable access to the prestige and resources of endowed professorships merits evaluation. We investigated this question in obstetrics and gynecology, a field that focuses on the health of women and in which women are much better represented than other specialties of medicine. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): We compiled a list of the top 25 United States departments of obstetrics and gynecology and contacted department chairs (and used department websites) to obtain lists of faculty and their positions. Scopus, department websites, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER were used to collect h-Index, number of publications and citations, graduation year, degrees, gender, and NIH-funding. We conducted a bivariate comparison of endowed professorship attainment by gender using a chi-square test and created a multiple variable regression model. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 680 obstetrics and gynecology faculty across 23 departments that had endowed chairs, 64 out of 400 women (16%) and 66 out of 280 men (24%) held endowed chairs (p = 0.01). The multivariable model suggested no independent gender difference in attainment of an endowed chair after adjusting for covariates. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine gender as a variable in endowed chair allocation in top obstetrics and gynecology academic departments. Our findings suggest a significant gender difference in the allocation of endowed chairs. That difference is driven by gender differences in academic rank, graduation year, publications, and funding.

What will it take: gender equality in leadership by 2030. Collaborating internationally and across sectors to Transform Women's Leadership Pathways,Halliday L.; ,"The inaugural Transforming Women's Leadership Pathways (TWLP) event in 2020 brought higher education, industry and government partners together to develop action plans to close the gender leadership gap across 10 sectors by 2030. This was the first time a group of top international universities (the PLuS Alliance) collaborated with industry and government to tackle this global challenge. Representatives from 10 sectors engaged in working groups focussed on the delivery of an action plan for their specific area. The 10 groups were the Arts, Corporate, Engineering, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Higher Education, Media & Communications, Medicine, Policy & Politics, Science, and Technology. The action plans articulate the practical steps universities, industry and government must take to see more women in leadership by 2030. Building on previous initiatives, working groups tested recommendations against the guiding principles of intersectionality, sustainability and the changing nature of work to create solutions that are inclusive and adaptive for future ways of working. To ensure the recommendations put to universities, industry and government were evidence-based and inclusive, each working group was designed to include a diverse group of people from multiple institutions and professional backgrounds. Pre-reading packs specific to each area and general resources around women's leadership were circulated to participants to provide a starting point for best practice research, programs, policies, processes and systems. Experts provided custom case studies and participated in the groups. A Student Ambassador program was developed to engage students from each of the PLuS universities. This allowed students to connect and network with leading academics, policymakers, and professionals across each sector. An event website served as a key part of the initiative's success. It stored supporting resources including session guidelines, technical support, action plan templates, pre-reading, case studies, programs and timetables, event support and contact information, as well as a networking lounge. The 10 action plans have been published, and we are working individually and in concert with partners from higher education, industry and government to implement the recommendations to drive workplace change and to close the gender leadership gap by 2030. Transparency and the tracking of our progress and impact is key to our program design, and outcomes will be shared on our website. This novel approach would not have been possible without the buyin from our passionate working group members, and our leaders.

The names of full professors with and without endowed chairs were collected and a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to predict having an endowed chair considering gender, primary degree, NIH funding, and citation number. Secondary analyses repeated the models separately for individuals holding an MD or MD/PhD versus those with a non-MD doctoral degree (i.e., PhD). There were 715 full professors (36% women) and 115 endowed chairs (35% women). When adjusting for primary degree type, funding, and citations, women were significantly more likely to hold an endowed chair than men.

Gender Distribution of Deans Among US Medical Schools: Towards Equity in Academic Medicine,Nguyen J.; ; Sen-Crowe B.; Sutherland M.; McKenney M.; Elkbuli A.,"Background: Less than half of medical school professorships and decanal ranks are held by women. Our study investigates the gender-based geographical distribution and differences in lifetime peer-reviewed publications, H-index, and grant funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of all allopathic medical school deans in the United States (US). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A cross-sectional cohort study utilizing data from US allopathic medical school websites, PubMed, and the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools regarding lifetime peer-reviewed publications and quantity/monetary sum of NIH grants received by medical school deans. Descriptive statistics, independent sample T-tests, and ANOVA were performed with statistical significance defined as P < 0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Women occupied 33/157 (21.0%) dean positions overall. Compared to women, men possess higher mean number of lifetime peer-reviewed publications (112.0 vs. 55.2, P = 0.001) and H-index (43.2 vs. 25.7, P = 0.001); however, there are no differences in the mean number of NIH grants (27.5 vs. 19.1, P = 0.323) nor mean total NIH funding received ($18,931,336 vs. $14,289,529, P = 0.524). While significant differences in mean H-index between all US regions were found (P = 0.002), no significant differences exist between major US regions regarding the mean lifetime publication count (P = 0.223), NIH grants received (P = 0.200), nor total NIH funding (P = 0.824) received. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A significant discrepancy in the gender distribution, lifetime peer-reviewed publications, and H-index of allopathic medical school deans exists across the US, highlighting the need for adequate support for women in academic medicine.

An Update on the Progress Toward Gender Equity in US Academic Pharmacy,Draugalis J.R.; ; Medina M.S.; Taylor J.N.; Plaza C.M.; Lopez E.J.,"Objective. To evaluate the status of gender equity in US pharmacy education since the two previous publications on the topic in 2004 and 2014.Methods. Data were gathered from existing national databases, internal American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) databases, AACP meeting minutes, published reports, scholarly articles, pharmacy association websites, individual school websites, and LinkedIn profiles. Differences between men and women were evaluated on degree completion, discipline, rank, tenure status, research, leadership development, leadership positions, salaries, and professional awards. Comparisons were also made to academic medicine and dentistry.Results. Fifty-one percent of full-time faculty members across all academic pharmacy disciplines are women. The percentage of women at the rank of professor was 36.6%, compared to 25% in 2014. Of the 2992 tenured or tenure track pharmacy faculty, 39.2% were women. Out of 388 department chairs, 146 were women. Throughout 2014-2021, there were 121 chief executive officer (CEO) dean permanent appointments, with men holding 91 (75.2%) and women holding 30 (24.8%). Women received 29.7% of the National Institutes of Health grants awarded to pharmacy schools compared to men (70.3%), although women's funding amount was higher. In both the pharmacy practice discipline and all sciences disciplines, the total salary across all ranks and years in rank was significantly higher for men than women, even for department chairs, but there were no differences for CEO deans. To date, women have received 13% of four national pharmacy organizations' top 13 awards.Conclusion. Since 2014, some achievement gaps have narrowed, but areas of concern still exist and need continued attention and resources so inequities can be eliminated. Women in academic pharmacy need mentoring and support to extend throughout the trajectory of their careers in areas such as academic advancement, grant applications, salary negotiation, leadership pursuit, and award applications.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.",2022,/,American journal of pharmaceutical education,86,10,ajpe8962,637901088,https://dx.doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8962,35483826,#230,Draugalis 2022,"",""
Predicting When Women Will Achieve Equitable Representation in Four Specialties: The WHEN Study,Bachour K.; ; Dodge S.E.; Kearing S.; Douglas P.S.; Wong S.; Coylewright M.,"Background: For 2 decades, women have made up nearly half of medical school graduates, yet this has not translated to equity in promotion.

To improve it is major issue to nursing students' education curriculum. The study is a descriptive survey study to identify the critical thinking disposition, self-leadership, and nursing professionalism of nursing students who experienced clinical practice. The participants were nursing students from a local university in Korea. Data were collected by structured questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Scheffe's test was used for post-hoc analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression with SPSS/WIN Statistics 22.0. According to the general characteristics, critical thinking disposition was revealed significant differences with respect to gender and personality. Self-leadership was found to present significant differences with respect to grade and religion. Nursing professionalism showed significant differences in grade, personality and thoughts on nursing profession. Nursing professionalism had a significant positive correlation with critical thinking disposition and self-leadership, and there was also a significant positive correlation between critical thinking disposition and self-leadership. As a result of analyzing the factors affecting nursing professionalism, critical thinking disposition and self-leadership had a significant effect on the nursing professionalism of nursing students. The regression model was statistically significant, and its explanatory power was 45.4%.The results revealed that nursing professionalism is related to critical thinking disposition and self-leadership and that they are the primary factors in forming nursing professionalism.

Five years later, as the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) welcomes the second female college president, this article explores the gendered leadership gap in EM from an organisational and intersectional feminist perspective and recommends high-level strategies for change. Notably, ACEM has demonstrated committed engagement with gender equity, such as the establishment of the Advancing Women in Emergency Section. It has also achieved gender parity in provisional trainees and improved women's representation on the ACEM Board.

We conducted an anonymous online survey through which we could explore the gender gap in neurointervention, identify potential issues, difficulties, or obstacles women might face, and evaluate if men encounter similar issues. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An online questionnaire was designed in SurveyMonkey. Invitation to participate was emailed through national and international neurointerventional societies as well as directly through private mailing lists to men and women working in neurointervention. Responses were collected from 10 May 2019 to 10 September 2019. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 295 complete responses, 173 (59%) male and 122 (41%) female. Most respondents (83%) fell within age categories 35-60 years, with representation from 40 countries across five continents. In all 95% were working full time, 73% had worked as a neurointerventionalist for >6 years, 77% worked in University-affiliated teaching institutions. Almost half of the respondents indicated no female neurointerventionalist worked in their center. Female respondents were younger and age-adjusted analysis was undertaken. Significantly fewer females than males were married and had children. Significantly fewer females held supervisory roles, held academic titles, and significantly less had a mentor. Females were less satisfied in their careers. More females felt they receive less recognition than colleagues of the opposite sex. Males had a greater proportion of work time dedicated to neurointervention. Similar proportions of both genders experienced bullying in work (40%-47%); however, sexual harassment was more common for females. There were no differences between genders in how they dealt with complications or their effects on mental well-being. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There are many potential reasons why women are underrepresented in neurointervention, however, the literature suggests this is not unique to our specialty.

There are efforts in nearly every medical specialty to increase the diversity of the physician workforce. Overall diversity in the medical field has improved to some extent, particularly in terms of gender. However, significant disparities have persisted in senior academic positions, as reported by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).

Under-representation of women in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) remains the bane of the modern medicine, impeding the development of sexspecific guidelines in cardiovascular diseases. Female leadership in clinical trials has been shown to enhance the inclusion of women as trial participants. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted women in academia, there is no data thus far reporting the impact of the pandemic in terms of presenters and leadership of late-breaking clinical trials (LBCT) in cardiology during this period. <ovid:br/>Purpose(s): We aimed to determine inclusion of WIC in LBCTs leadership and their correlation to inclusion of women in reported RCTs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In our comprehensive analysis, we included all LBCTs presented at major international cardiovascular meetings reported over the period of January 2020 to February 2022. Data were derived from the original presentation at the meeting and/or simultaneous/ subsequent publication of manuscript. Sex of the presenter (woman or man), was assessed by either original videos of the presentation at the meeting, or based on pronoun use in the biographies derived from institutional profiles. The presence or absence of reporting of sex distribution of study participants were also recorded from original presentation at the meeting and/or published manuscript. Proportion of women included in each trial was sourced from either original publication or calculated from any similar data shown during the presentations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 400 of RCTs from 19 meetings were included with a total of 400 presenters/principal investigators recorded - 32 (8%) women and 368 (92%) men. There were no significant differences between 2020 and 2021 [15 (7.2%) women in 2021 vs. 17 (19.3%) in 2020 (P=0.446)]. Proportions of women included in RCTs with WIC (37.3%) vs. non-WIC (38.7%) presenters were comparable (p=0.559), while 45% of RCTs didn't report sex distribution of participants. Except for 2 meetings (CRT 2020 and 2022), all others were virtual. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): WIC representation as RCTs presenters was significantly low, despite the opportunity of virtual attendance afforded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Modest inclusion of women irrespective of sex of RCT leadership emphasizes multi-level problems that require more actionable solutions: I.e. implicit bias training started as early as medical school, continuing education on necessity for diversity, equity and inclusion, patient and public involvement, and comprehensive guidance on trial design, such that future RCT participants reflect the populations intended to treat.

GENDER DISPARITY IN LEADERSHIP ROLES: HOW DOES OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY COMPARE TO OTHER SPECIALITIES?,Vukcevich O.; ; Singh M.; Mitchell E.; Sheffler P.; Nahas S.; Stuparich M.A.; Behbehani S.,"Objective: This study aims to explore gender trends in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) leadership positions compared to other specialties at medical academic institutions in the western region and identify potential contributing factors to existing gender discrepancies. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Western states were chosen based on classification of western region states defined by the American Medical Association. These states included Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington. A total of 26 United States allopathic medical schools were identified. Information collected included gender of department chair, number of years post-residency, subspecialty training, number of divisions in the department, and number of physicians in department. Gender identity of the medical school dean was also collected. Medical fields studied included OBGYN, family medicine, psychiatry, surgery, and internal medicine. All information gathered was publicly available. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to examine differences in the proportion of male and female chairs across the major medical specialties and associations between specialty chair gender and subspecialty training, department size, and division size. An independent samples t-test was conducted to assess differences in years in practice between male and female chairs across specialties. <ovid:br/>Result(s): OBGYN and family medicine department chairs showed no significant difference in gender proportion (ps >.05), whereas psychiatry, surgery and internal medicine had significantly more male chairs compared to female chairs (p =.022,.003, and.004 respectively). There were also significantly more male deans compared to female deans (p =.006). Gender of specialty chair was not associated with subspecialty training, size of department, or number of divisions, and male and female chairs did not differ in terms of years in practice, t(106) = 0.98, p =.328. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although there has been increasing representation of women in academic medicine, significant gender discrepancies still exist in leadership positions. The fields of obstetrics and gynecology and family medicine set the precedent for fields to follow having more women in department chair positions compared to internal medicine, surgery, and psychiatry. Our current data show a multitude of factors did not significantly contribute to the gender identity of department chairs, raising the question of why such discrepancies exist. Our future directions include further investigation of this trend across all US allopathic medical schools. Impact Statement: Women continue to be underrepresented in academic medicine leadership with existing gender discrepancies in internal medicine, surgery, and psychiatry department chair and dean positions in western region institutions. Women have equitable representation in leadership positions in obstetrics and gynecology and family medicine. Further research is needed to identify existing trends nationwide.

"RELAX: IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUITY, LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY TRAINING FOR RURAL PROVIDERS",Sun S.; ; Beste J.; Shah S.; Tobey M.; Tripathi S.,"SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included fellows from four rural and global health fellowships: The MGH Rural Health Leadership Fellowship, The UW Global and Rural Health Fellowship in Internal Medicine, the UW Global Emergency Medicine and Rural Health Fellowship, and the UCSF HEAL Initiative. Participants included 25 total fellows in AY 20-21 (80% physician, 20% NP) and 32 total fellows in AY 21-22 (63% physician, 13% nursing, 19% public health, 6% pre-med). This curriculum consisted of monthly online synchronous sessions supplemented with asynchronous activities. DESCRIPTION: RELAX began in AY 2019-2020 as a curriculum in rural health leadership and advocacy for early- career physicians practicing in rural communities. Using feedback from participants and faculty, the curriculum was subsequently revised to place a greater emphasis on health equity and peer learning. The goal of RELAX is to bring together fellows working in rural communities to 1) create a vibrant monthly learning exchange between rural fellows, and 2) expose fellows to best practices and role models in rural health leadership and management. EVALUATION: Annual pre- and post-intervention surveys of participants using 5-point Likert scales and free-form short answers evaluated participants' beliefs about their abilities and readiness for responsibilities in leadership, advocacy, and promoting gender and racial equity in rural health leadership. Surveys also solicited participants' learning preferences: didactics vs case discussions, speakers with front-line experience vs institutional leaders, connecting with learners, and homogeneity vs heterogeneity of participants. In AY 21-22, participants were surveyed on their leadership challenges and career concerns. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Four areas for improvement were identified: 1) Engagement - balancing didactics and group discussion, incorporating check-in and wrap-ups; 2) Community - incorporating retreats, a minimum attendance commitment, an opt-in structure, defining jargon, and asynchronous activities; 3) Curriculum cohesion - session themes were coordinated and revisited regularly; 4) Diversity - the importance of exposing physicians to perspectives outside their own disciplines to develop emotional intelligence, identify biases in power and privilege, and to model health equity. The target audience was expanded beyond U.S.- based physicians working in communities they are not from to include international sites, participants who are from the communities they work in, and nonphysicians. Speakers were prioritized to those with on-the-ground experience working and living in rural communities. Participants reported facing similar leadership challenges despite working across diverse disciplines and sites.

Factors associated with endowed chair allocation in medical oncology divisions and departments in the United States,Jia L.; ; Rooney M.K.; Jacobson C.; Griffith K.A.; Jagsi R.; Markham M.J.,"Background: Despite an increasing number of female physicians in the workforce, a gender disparity remains in many leadership roles in medicine. Endowed chairs can provide a multitude of research and career opportunities; thus, they are coveted positions in academic medicine. We examined factors associated with holding endowed chairs in oncology across the US, with a focus on whether a gender difference existed, as has been demonstrated in top internal medicine departments more generally. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In 2019, we identified 95 academic oncology divisions/departments in the US, using the Oncology Division Chiefs & Department Chairs listing in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) myConnection forum to define the institutions included. We requested a list of full professors and endowed chairs in those divisions/departments, relying on public data on websites when an institution did not respond. Using public data (e.g., institutional websites, NIH reporter, Scopus, state licensing boards), we collected information on gender, degree, total NIH funding as PIs, H-indices, publication and citation numbers, and graduation year for these individuals. We then created a multivariable logistic regression model to examine if, after controlling for other variables, gender was independently associated with an increased likelihood of holding an endowed chair. <ovid:br/>Result(s): One thousand thirtythree oncology full professors were identified, 290 (25.6%) of whom held endowed chairs. Overall, and in an adjusted model, greater research productivity (as measured through publications, citations, and h-index) and greater levels of NIH funding were significantly associated with having an endowed chair. Gender was not significantly associated with endowed chair status (21.9% [95% CI:17.2-27.3] of females and 26.8% [23.8-29.9] for males held endowed chairs; p = 0.11) on bivariable analysis, nor was it significant in the adjusted multivariable model (p = 0.50). Power to detect the observed difference given the total number of professors and their gender distribution was found to be~53%, suggesting a 47% chance of failing to reject the null hypothesis of equal gender distributions in endowed chairs when the observed difference is as large as estimated. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Among oncology full professors, gender was not significantly associated with endowed chair status, although the number of professors in this field is too small to definitively rule out a modest gender difference. This finding contrasts with prior work that revealed a more substantial difference by gender that remained significant after controlling for other factors in a study, including all divisions in the Departments of Internal Medicine at top medical institutions. Further work is necessary to understand what specialty-specific and institutional cultural factors may help mitigate challenges in the pursuit of equity, diversity, and inclusion.",2021,/,Journal of Clinical Oncology,39,15 SUPPL,,635590294,https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.11044,,#269,Jia 2021,"",""

Moral determinants of health: An overview of disparities in healthcare,Dissanaike S.; ; Matthews J.B.,"Healthcare disparities are a serious problem that shorten the lives of many Americans, even after accounting for social, cultural, and economic factors and correcting for confounders such as the lack of medical insurance and access to healthcare, black Americans and other minority groups receive worse medical care and experience worse outcomes as a result. Healthcare does not occur in a vacuum; surgeons cannot serve our patients' needs isolated in a bubble and cocooned from larger societal concerns. Although disparities rooted in race likely have the greatest negative effects on our patients' health, plenty of groups exist that have not historically received equal opportunities and acceptance within the surgical world. Despite now accounting for more than one half of all medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions, and the gender pay gap has remained significant in all branches of medicine. It will require active, multifaceted, and sustained effort to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery.

Meeting the Needs of Mid-Career Women in Academic Medicine: One Model Career Development Program,Chaudron L.H.; ; Anson E.; Bryson Tolbert J.M.; Inoue S.; Cerulli C.,"Background: A gender gap in leadership exists in academic medicine. Medical school faculty rosters indicate an overrepresentation of women in entry-level positions. As positions increase in seniority and leadership responsibilities, there is an underrepresentation of women. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully understood, but the mid-career transition is one career point that some scholars hypothesize is part of the leaky pipeline. The University of Rochester Medical Center developed a career development program (CDP) to focus on this pivotal career developmental time period. We assessed the impact of the CDP on self-assessed knowledge, competence, self-identified goals, and promotions. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Four cohorts of mid-career women completed preself-assessment and postself-assessment and ranked their current knowledge and competence on 11 topics grouped into 3 career development domains. They identified three personal goals and ranked their success in achieving them at the end of the program. Facilitators followed participants annually for promotions and accomplishments. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Fifty-one participants reported statistically significant improvements in knowledge and competency in all domains-promotional, organizational infrastructure, and communication. They identified 148 individual goals that we grouped into 4 categories: career development (32%), leadership (26%), networking (22%), and negotiation (20%), and the majority achieved their individual goals. Upon the last review, 23.5% of women were promoted or received tenure. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A CDP targeting the needs of mid-career women faculty in academic medicine improved knowledge and competency in multiple domains.

The goal of this study was to determine if sex coding exists in EM job advertisements, and to see if there were differences in coding of job advertisements between academic vs. non-academic jobs or administrative vs. non-administrative jobs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a cross sectional study of EM jobs advertised in the United States on 16 academic and non-academic medical job databases from September 2020-February 2021. Job advertisements were cut and pasted verbatim for the purposes of the study. Using a sex decoder program based on prior research by Gaucher et al on sexed wording in job advertisements, we analyzed each job to determine if the job advertisement contained any sex coded words and if the advertisement was overall highly masculine, masculine, highly feminine, feminine, or neutral. We also recorded which individual words were coded out as masculine or feminine in the advertisement. Each job was categorized as academic (core faculty at a training program) or non- academic, administrative (director, chair, vice chair, chief, or assistant or associate director or chief) or non-administrative. The location of the job in terms of region of the US was also recorded, as was any notation that the job required subspecialty/fellowship training. After data was gathered, it was manually reviewed to remove duplicate listings across multiple websites. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis. The study was reviewed by the IRB and found to be exempt. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Seventy-four job advertisements for EM were posted to the 16 websites during the study period. 44 (59.4%) of these coded out as masculine or strongly masculine, 18 (24.3%) coded out as feminine or strongly feminine, and 12 (16.2%) were neutral. Only one job advertisement contained no sex coded words. There was no difference in the sex coding of jobs when compared by region of the country (p=0.45), subspecialty requirement (p=0.87), academic vs non-academic (p=0.75) or administrative vs non- administrative (p=0.59). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Job advertisements for emergency physicians tend to contain more masculine coded language. Almost all job advertisements for emergency physicians in this study contained at least one sex coded word. Further studies could explore whether changing the language of job advertisements in EM has an impact on the proportion of women who choose to apply to EM jobs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021",2021,/,Annals of Emergency Medicine,78,4 Supplement,S91,2015226168,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.236,,#287,O'Brien 2021,"",""
The Leadership Landscape: Characteristics of Current Faculty in Leadership Positions in Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments,Das D.; ; Geynisman-Tan J.; Mueller M.G.; Kenton K.,"Study Objective: To describe the proportion of female faculty in departmental administrative and educational leadership roles in Obstetrics and Gynecology departments. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Cross sectional observational study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Accredited Obstetrics & Gynecology residency programs. Patients or Participants: 288 accredited residency programs were identified from 2019 to 2020 with 1237 individuals in leadership positions. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Similar to a 2012-2013 survey by Hofler et al., residency program websites and corresponding fellowships (Maternal Fetal Medicine, Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS), Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI), Gynecologic Oncology), departmental, and divisional websites were queried for those in administrative and educational leadership positions. Information regarding gender (as determined by surrogates of name and photographic gender expression), medical and academic degrees, academic rank, and subspecialty certification was abstracted. <ovid:br/>Measurements and Main Results: Within administrative leadership roles, women comprised 29% of chairs, 46% of vice chairs, and 47% of division directors; women held significantly fewer chair positions than men (p <.001). In educational leadership, women made up 71% of medical school clerkship directors, 58% of residency directors, and 50% fellowship directors. Women were more likely to hold educational leadership positions (56% vs 40%, p<.001) while men were more likely to hold administrative leadership positions (68% vs 52%, p <.001). There was greatest gender equity within FPMRS and least gender equity in Gynecologic Oncology and REI. Female leaders were more likely to have received additional academic degrees (ex. MBA, MPH) than their male counterparts (19% vs 13%, p=.002). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Women continue to be underrepresented in administrative leadership positions. Compared to 2012-2013, there is only a 9% increase in proportion of women chairing and 10% vice chairing Obstetrics and Gynecology departments; the increase is more substantial in other positions, such as division directors (17%).

Women in anaesthesia: a scoping review,Bosco L.; ; Lorello G.R.; Flexman A.M.; Hastie M.J.,"Despite an increase in the proportion of women anaesthesiologists over time, women remain under-represented in academic and leadership positions, honour awards, and academic promotion. Current literature has identified several reasons for the observed gender disparity in anaesthesiology leadership and faculty positions, including unsupportive work environments, lack of mentorship, personal choices, childcare responsibilities, and active discrimination against women. A scoping review design was selected to examine the nature and extent of available research. Our review provides an overview of the literature that explores gender issues in anaesthesiology, identifies gaps in the literature, and appraises effective strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesiology. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to July 2019, and included 30 studies for analysis. Most reports used retrospective or survey methodologies. The review shows that women anaesthesiologists face gender biases in the work environment, are under-represented in various positions of leadership or influence, and as authors. Work-life demands may impose a challenge. Motivation and interest in career advancement of women anaesthesiologists have not been well studied. Several strategies have been proposed, ranging from an individual to administrative level, which may help anaesthesiologists achieve equal representation of women in the field.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2020,/,British Journal of Anaesthesia,124,3,e134EP  - e147,2004692966,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2019.12.021,31983412,#296,Bosco 2020,"",""
Women in radiology: gender diversity is not a metric-it is a tool for excellence,Kubik-Huch R.A.; ; Vilgrain V.; Krestin G.P.; Reiser M.F.; Attenberger U.I.; Muellner A.U.; Hess C.P.; Hricak H.,"Abstract: Women in Focus: Be Inspired was a unique programme held at the 2019 European Congress of Radiology that was structured to address a range of topics related to gender and healthcare, including leadership, mentoring and the generational progression of women in medicine. In most countries, women constitute substantially fewer than half of radiologists in academia or private practice despite frequently accounting for at least half of medical school enrolees. Furthermore, the proportion of women decreases at higher academic ranks and levels of leadership, a phenomenon which has been referred to as a ""leaky pipeline"". Gender diversity in the radiologic workplace, including in academic and leadership positions, is important for the present and future success of the field. It is a tool for excellence that helps to optimize patient care and research; moreover, it is essential to overcome the current shortage of radiologists. This article reviews the current state of gender diversity in academic and leadership positions in radiology internationally and explores a wide range of potential reasons for gender disparities, including the lack of role models and mentorship, unconscious bias and generational changes in attitudes about the desirability of leadership positions. Strategies for both individuals and institutions to proactively increase the representation of women in academic and leadership positions are suggested. Key Points: * Gender-diverse teams perform better. Thus, gender diversity throughout the radiologic workplace, including in leadership positions, is important for the current and future success of the field. * Though women now make up roughly half of medical students, they remain underrepresented among radiology trainees, faculty and leaders. * Factors leading to the gender gap in academia and leadership positions in Radiology include a lack of role models and mentors, unconscious biases, other societal barriers and generational changes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, The Author(s).",2020,/,European Radiology,30,3,1644EP  - 1652,2003820957,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06493-1,31802213,#297,Kubik-Huch 2020,"",""
The proportion of male and female editors in women's health journals: A critical analysis and review of the sex gap,Grinnell M.; ; Higgins S.; Yost K.; Ochuba O.; Lobl M.; Grimes P.; Wysong A.,"Background: Historically, women have been underrepresented in leadership positions in medicine. The reasons for this are multifactorial. In recent years, women's representation in medicine has improved. However, inequities in the proportion of men and women in medical leadership remain, especially with regard to editorial journal boards. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to explore current trends of women in leadership positions on journal editorial boards. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A comprehensive search for women's health journals was performed in collaboration with university librarians in February 2019 using EMBASE, Scopus, SciFinder, and MEDLINE records for journals with relevance to women's health. Each journal was e-mailed to verify the accuracy of the journal editorial boards listed on their respective webpages. Five categories, as well as the totals for each journal, were analyzed for the proportion of women versus men: editor-in-chief, associate editor, deputy editor, and section editor, and other. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Women comprised the minority of positions on women's health editorial boards. Of the total 1440 board members included, 602 members (42%) were women and 838 members (58%) were men. Women occupied 54 of 132 editor-in-chief positions (41%), 257 of 596 associate editor positions (43%), 13 of 42 deputy editor positions (30%), 46 of 120 section editor positions (38%), and 232 of 549 other editor positions (42%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although the sex gap in leadership in medicine is improving, it is still present. Our findings suggest that women are underrepresented as editors at most levels in women's health journals centered on topics such as reproductive health, obstetrics and gynecology, perinatology, gynecological oncology, and breastfeeding. With sponsorship/mentorship for women, flexible scheduling, and considerate thought in leadership appointment, this sex gap will continue to improve.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2020,/,International Journal of Women's Dermatology,6,1,7EP  - 12,2004624892,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijwd.2019.11.005,,#298,Grinnell 2020,"",""
The Podiatric Medical Profession: A Gender Comparison,Brower B.A.; ; Butterworth M.L.; Crawford M.E.; Jennings M.M.; Tan Z.; Moore J.D.; Suzuki S.; Carpenter B.B.,"The number of women in podiatric medicine and surgery has increased steadily over the past 4 decades; however, there appears to be a large and continued gender gap with respect to representation in academic medicine and other positions of power. National and state level organizational data were obtained from multiple podiatry professional societies to evaluate the rate at which women achieved leadership roles within the podiatric profession over time. A secondary questionnaire was also developed and electronically mailed to 8684 doctors of podiatric medicine to help capture additional leadership information and to provide further insight into the trends observed. The response rate was 26% (2276/8684). Female representation in academia, research/publications, most leadership positions, and board certifications has increased over time, but at a slower rate than the number of women entering the profession. We observed a decreasing trend of females completing fellowships, speaking at national meetings, becoming residency directors, and receiving American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons- and American Podiatric Medical Association-sponsored grants/awards. Based on the survey results, female podiatric physicians were more likely to be single, have fewer children, spend more time in a clinical setting, be less satisfied with work, and experience higher work stress levels than their male colleagues. Of the female respondents, 73% described experiencing gender discrimination at some point in their career, and 42% reported experiencing sexual harassment, compared with only 6% and 5% of men, respectively.

Has a critical mass of women resulted in gender equity in gynecologic surgery?,Heisler C.A.; ; Mark K.; Ton J.; Miller P.; Temkin S.M.,"Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women. Policies related to pregnancy and parenting may disproportionately affect the careers of women gynecologists.

Women in radiology: why is the pipeline still leaking and how can we plug it?,Weigel K.S.; ; Kubik-Huch R.A.; Gebhard C.,"Today, >50% of medical students are women. This proportion, however, dramatically decreases throughout the higher levels of academia, a phenomenon described as the ""leaky pipeline."" This gender disparity is particularly pronounced in academic radiology, mirrored by a significant lack of women in editorial board positions, key authorship positions, and conference keynote lectures. The scientific invisibility is not only a key hurdle facing women in radiology, the lack of female role models and mentors in this context might also negatively affect career choices of young female radiologists thereby further widen the existing gender gap. In this article, the origins of the ""leaky pipeline,"" the reasons for women's choice or rejection of careers in academic medicine, as well as solutions as to how the continued loss of a large part of the talent pool can be prevented, are discussed. Active monitoring and intervention are needed to identify problems, plan targeted actions, and evaluate their efficacy. Among those are measures that address a lack of support in the workplace, specific mentoring needs of women, exible working hours and opportunities to align work and family, financial constraints, and support for returners after career breaks. Cooperative steps of politics and universities need to be taken that ensure a sustainable way forward to enable many talented women in radiology to achieve their full potential.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2019.",2020,/,Acta Radiologica,61,6,743EP  - 748,2003514993,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0284185119881723,31648538,#302,Weigel 2020,"",""

Gender distribution in United States anaesthesiology residency programme directors: trends and implications,Gonzalez L.S.; ; Fahy B.G.; Lien C.A.,"The under-representation of women in academic leadership roles, including in anaesthesiology, is a well-documented phenomenon that has persisted for decades despite more women attending medical school, participating in anaesthesiology residencies, and joining academic faculties. The percentage of female anaesthesiologists who hold senior academic ranks or leadership roles, such as chair, lags behind the percentage of female anaesthesiologists overall. Trends towards increasing the numbers of women serving in educational leadership roles, specifically residency programme directors, suggest that there are areas in which academic anaesthesiology has been, and can continue, improving gender imbalance.

Gender Issues in Academic Hospital Medicine: a National Survey of Hospitalist Leaders,Herzke C.; ; Bonsall J.; Bertram A.; Yeh H.-C.; Apfel A.; Cofrancesco J.,"Background: Gender inequities are documented in academic medicine. Within General Internal Medicine (GIM), there are fewer female division directors and first and last authors on publications. With gender parity in US medical school graduates and with Academic Hospital (AH) medicine being a relatively newer discipline, one might postulate that AH would have less gender inequity. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A national survey of AH programs was developed via literature review and expert recommendations. Domains included program and faculty information. Gender of the leader was determined via website or telephone call. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Leaders of AH programs associated with the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Programs without a primary teaching hospital or hospitalist program and those not staffed by university-affiliated physicians were excluded. Main Measures: Description and characteristics of leaders and programs including a multivariable analysis of gender of hospitalist leaders and the portion of female faculty. Key Results: 59% response rate (80 of 135); there were no differences between responders/non-responders in NIH funding (p = 0.12), type of institution (p = 0.09), geographic region (p = 0.15), or year established (p = 0.86). Reported number of female and male faculty were approximately equal. 80% of hospitalist leaders were male; 37% of male hospitalist leaders were professors, no female leaders were professors. In univariate and multivariate analysis only the number of hospitals staffed was a significant predictor of having a female hospitalist leader. There were no significant predictors of having fewer female faculty. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated gender inequality in academic hospital medicine regarding leadership and rank.

47: Sex-based differences in gynecologic surgeon imposter syndrome and leadership and promotion in an academic hospital,Kisby C.K.; ; Mara K.C.; Laughlin S.; Occhino J.A.; Green I.,"Objectives: The failure to internalize success, in the form of imposter syndrome, may be one contributor to the sex-based discrepancies in academic advancement in gynecologic surgeons. Our goal was to explore sex-based differences in imposter syndrome and associations with academic promotion and leadership attainment. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Gynecologic surgeons at one academic institution were surveyed. The survey consisted of the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; higher score indicates higher imposter tendencies), and institutional culture questions using a 5-point Likert scale. Respondents disclosed academic rank and leadership positions (reported as leadership-years). Descriptive statistics are reported as frequencies and percentages or medians and interquartile ranges. The CIPS score, leadership-years, and Likert-type questions were compared between sexes using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Other categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The response rate was 60% (23/35 female, 9/18 male). Median CIPS scores were not statistically different (female 61 [46-72], male 46 [44-51]; p=0.07); however, for 7/20 questions, women had statistically higher imposter tendencies. There was a wide range of female scores regardless of career stage (Figure 1). Men did not score higher in imposter tendencies for any questions. Females exhibited higher imposter tendencies pertaining to fear of living up to future expectations following praise (p=0.03) or success (p=0.01). Women tended to agree with statements such as ""I dread others evaluating me"" (p=0.01) and ""I'm afraid I may fail, even though I generally do well at what I attempt"" (p=0.004). Males reported more growth in confidence since their training (p=0.02) and more strongly disagreed with the statement ""I hesitate prior to declaring a procedure complete"" (male 100% vs female 62%, p=0.003).

What is the status of gender equity in academic emergency medicine leadership?,Linden J.A.; ; Rounds K.L.; Madsen T.E.; Baird J.; Fang A.; Lall M.D.; Lin M.P.; Raukar N.; Sethuraman K.N.; Dobiesz V.,"Background and Objectives: Women constitute 36% of EM residents and 36% EM faculty in academic EDs. Women remain underrepresented in academic leadership positions - only 15% of EM chairs are women. Change in the gender distribution of EM leadership positions over time or in specific leadership domains has not been studied, and little is known about the clinical hours of leaders in academic EM by gender. We sought to analyze leadership composition, and compare annual base clinical hours in academic EDs by gender, as reported in the Association for Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine Benchmark Survey (AACEM-BS). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We analyzed the gender composition of faculty in EM leadership positions utilizing the AACEM-BS data from 2015-2018. Leadership positions were categorized as executive (chair), operations, education, research or none. Leadership positions were further stratified to tiers (Senior: chair, operations director, program director, Mid level: vice/associate, and Junior: assistant). The odds of being in any leadership role and in specific roles by gender after controlling for academic vs community site, academic rank, years at faculty, and survey year were calculated using multiple logistic regression. We tracked leadership gender distribution over time, and annual base clinical hours. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 8632 individuals were included; 2852(34%) were women. Women had significantly fewer years as faculty compared with men: mean 9.1 (SD 7.3) vs 12.6 (9.2), held lower academic rank, and were more likely to have an educational (OR 2.4, 95%CI:1.98-2.84) and less likely to have any leadership role (OR 0.75, 95%CI: 0.66-0.84).

Women and Leadership in Radiation Oncology: How are we doing?,Odei B.; ; Gawu P.; Bae S.; Fabian D.; Pan J.; Arnett A.L.H.; Pardo D.A.D.; Mitchell D.L.,"Purpose/Objective(s): There has been increased scrutiny over opportunities for leadership roles for women in medicine. In radiation oncology (RO), where women constitute a small minority, the presence of qualified women in leadership is paramount to provide effective leadership, unique perspectives, mentorship, and to serve as a paragon of possibility in the era of the glass-ceiling. Consequently, in this study, we evaluate the extent of progress of women in leadership roles in RO by employing a comparative analysis of female leadership among different medical specialties. Materials/Methods: We obtained workforce data from the AMA Physician Professional Data from the years 2006 and 2017 for 15 medical specialties for comparative evaluation. We also obtained 2019-2020 data from the ACGME database on the current program directors (PDs) of the medical specialties of interest. Finally, we obtained detailed information on Chairpersons from the 2019 AAMC Faculty Roster Database. Data was carefully categorized to capture gender differences. We subsequently confirmed all data by using exhaustive internet searches. Proportions of women among different specialties and their differences were analyzed using Binomial distribution. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In all, there were 485,543 (in 2006) and 549,764(in 2017) physicians belonging to 15 medical specialties that were examined. RO ranked 8<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> in female representation in the workforce in 2006, and 10<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> in 2017. Between 2006 and 2017, the rate of increase in female representation among specialties was highest in OB-Gyn (+15.4%) and Emergency Medicine (+12.2%); and lowest for orthopedic surgery (OrS; +1.9%) and RO (3.7%). Racial makeup of RO women in 2017 for Whites, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics were respectively 53%,28%, 5.4%, and 4%. 38% of PDs were women in our cohort. Pediatrics (60%) and OBGYN (59%) had the highest representation of female Program Directors (fPDs), while OrS (9%), Radiology (28%), and RO (31%) had the lowest. Pathology (56%) had disproportionately high numbers of fPDs relative to the proportion of women in the workforce (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer female Chairs(fCs) among all specialties. Overall, fCs constituted only 18% of all Chairpersons. The highest proportion of fCs was seen in Family Medicine (31%) and lowest in OrS (1.6%). fCs of White, Asian, Black, and Hispanic heritage were respectively 71%,12%, 8%, and 5%, with the remainder being of multiple ancestry. 10% of RO Chairs were women. Specialties with similar workforce distribution of women as RO had higher proportions of fCs. There were no Black, Latino, or Native American fCs in RO. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In comparison to other specialties, there have been fewer women choosing to pursue RO over the last decade. The proportional representation of female program directors in RO is largely on par with other specialties.

The Continued Gender Gap: Gynecologic Oncology in Academic Leadership Roles,Rubinsak L.A.; ; Rimel B.J.; Hong L.J.; Chandavarkar U.; Berry L.K.; Heisler C.; Benoit M.F.; Temkin S.M.,"Objectives: Despite increasing proportion of women among all medical specialties, women remain underrepresented in academic leadership positions. A majority of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBG) trainees have been women for over 20 years, yet the gender gap in leadership persists. Gender-specific leadership data within the specialty of Gynecologic Oncology (GO) is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize representation of faculty by gender and subspecialty in academic department leadership roles relevant to GO. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Using the American Association of Medical Colleges list of accredited schools of medicine, academic institutions were identified. Observational data was obtained through review of institutional websites in July 2019. Individual gender was defined based on photograph and pronoun use. Leadership positions evaluated were department Chair, GO division director, GO fellowship director, and cancer center director. Institutional characteristics were summarized in proportions and compared with chi square tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 154 accredited medical schools, 143 contain an OBG department with a Chair; 101 a GO division with a director; 98 a clinical cancer center with a director. Women were overrepresented in academic faculty roles in the US (66 vs 57%, p<0.01), but not within GO divisions (55 vs 57%). Among GO divisions, women were significantly (p<0.01) underrepresented in all leadership roles. OBG departments with women Chairs were more likely to have >50% GO women faculty (90.2 vs 9.8%, p<0.01) and have larger faculties with >20 members (80.4 vs 19.6%, p=0.02). Women GO division directors and fellowship directors were also more likely to have >50% women GO faculty (p <0.01 and p=0.02). Division director gender was associated with fellowship director gender; men division directors were more likely to have men fellowship directors than women (69.7% vs 30.3%, p<0.01). The cancer center director gender did not correlate to OBG or GO faculty or leadership characteristics. OBG Chair subspecialty was more commonly reproductive-health focused (70.7%) including MFM (39.2%); generalist in OBG (20.3%); and REI (11.2%), compared to surgically focused - gynecologic surgeons (13.9%) or GO (15.3%). Women GO's represent 8 of 143 OBG department Chairs (5.6%) and men GO's 14 of 143 (9.8%) of Chairs. Less than 10% of GO faculty (11.6% of women GO faculty) report to women GO's at the Chair level. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Inclusion alone has been insufficient for women to attain leadership roles in GO or OBG. Within academic institutions, GO women remain under-represented at both the OBG department and division leadership level.

"885 DIVERSITY OFFICES' IMPACT ON GENDER PARITY IN GASTROENTEROLOGY TRAINING: A DECADE-LONG ANALYSIS OF GASTROENTEROLOGY FELLOWSHIPS' LEADERSHIP, TRAINEES, AND APPLICANTS IN NORTH AMERICA FROM 2009-2018",Tse C.S.; ; Nguyen H.; Hinds S.K.; Haq M.; Moss S.F.; Bhagra A.,"Background: Despite the recognition of gender parity in medicine as crucial for creating a culture of diversity and equity, women comprise only 18% of practicing U.S. gastroenterologists. While 98% of the top 200 universities in America employ a diversity officer and hundreds of millions of dollars are spent annually on diversity, its impact on gender parity in gastroenterology (GI) training remains unclear. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study on the leadership, applicants, and first-year fellows at all accredited North American GI fellowship programs from 2009-2018 with data from the American College of Gastroenterology, Association of American Medical Colleges, and American Board of Internal Medicine. Diversity offices/officials and their mission and initiatives were searched from institutional websites of fellowship programs, its affiliated hospital and academic institution. Chi-square and t-test were used to analyze gender distribution. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 397,634 applications from 7,672 applicants to 158 GI fellowship programs, 4958 first-year GI fellows, and the current leadership of 189 GI programs were included. Women represent 33% (2549) of GI fellowship applicants and 33% first-year GI fellows (1641), which were stable over the past 10 years despite the constant influx of female trainees upstream; women comprise 48% and 49% of the matriculating and graduating medical school class, respectively, and 40% of internal medicine residents. States in the Northeast (NY, MA, RI) and West Coast (CA, WA) were amongst the top quintile of female GI applicants (30-34%) while the Southern states (KY, OK, NM) had the lowest quintile (24-27%) (Figure 1). Men hold the vast majority (83%) of leadership positions, especially the most senior ranks of Internal Medicine (IM) Department Chair and GI Division Chair (Table 1). Institutions with male IM Department Chairs had an 8:1 male-to-female ratio (89% vs 11%) for GI Division Chairs, whereas the ratio is 2:1 (39% vs 31%) at institutions with female IM Department Chairs (p=0.01). Institutions with male GI Division Chairs has a 3:1 male-to-female ratio (77% vs 23%) of GI Fellowship Director, whereas the gender distribution is nearly on par (54% vs 46%) at institutions with female GI Division Chairs (p=0.03) (Table 1). Although diversity offices are present at 87% (164/189) of GI fellowships and/or its affiliated hospital/institution, less than half (46%, 87/189) have a mission or initiatives to promote women in medicine and its presence was not associated with gender parity (Table 1). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender disparity within GI program leadership and trainees continue to exist. Contributing factors include fewer women applying (a ""leaky pipeline"") and a male-dominated organizational culture (a ""glass ceiling""), which has not changed over the past decade and was not impacted by institutional diversity initiatives.

Evaluation of gender disparity in gastroenterology societies' leadership,Trieu J.A.; ; Venu M.; Shokoohi S.; Wakade Z.; Asamoah N.; Hecht G.,"INTRODUCTION: Women comprise of one-third of gastroenterology trainees and only 13% of practicing gastroenterologists. Despite these numbers increasing over the years, women are still underrepresented in leadership positions. Involvement in society leadership plays a role in advancement in academic medicine leadership positions. A study revealed that between 2008 and 2017, women held fewer than 20% of the years serving as president in medical specialty societies. We aimed to evaluate the current percentage of women currently holding leadership positions in national gastroenterology societies in the United States. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Major national gastroenterology and hepatology societies were identified, including American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Members of the society governing boards and society committees were reviewed, and the number of females and males holding these positions were recorded. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Women hold approximately 21.2% of leadership positions on national gastroenterology governing boards, with the following percentages for each society: ASGE 33.3%; AGA 16.7%; ACG 13.6% (Table 1). All current presidents (2019-2020) are male. Overall, only 31% of committee chairs are held by a woman (Table 2). Review of female membership in each society revealed: AGA 26%, ACG 19.5%, ASGE 16%. Among the 3 societies, only ACG and AGA have committees dedicated to addressing the disparity of women in gastroenterology and to promoting women members within the society. ASGE has a special interest group dedicated to promoting women in endoscopy, but no subcommittee. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Gender disparity is a long-standing issue in medicine, particularly in gastroenterology, however, this appears to be improving. Women made up 40% of 1st year GI fellows for the 2018-19 academic year, which is a 10% increase over the last 10 years. With the continued rise in women in GI fellowship programs, emphasis needs to be placed on supporting women in societal involvement and leadership opportunities to ensure improved representation in the field. Further assessment of the barriers to women obtaining leadership positions and commitment to increase women representation in these societies is needed.

Gender disparity among United States academic oncology program leadership,Chowdhary M.; ; Chowdhary A.; Royce T.; Patel K.; Chhabra A.; Jain S.; Knoll M.; Vapiwala N.; Pro B.; Marwaha G.,"Purpose or Objective Female underrepresentation in academic medicine leadership is well-documented; however, oncology specific data are scarce. This study evaluates female leadership representation in academic medical oncology (MO), radiation oncology (RO) and surgical oncology (SO) programs. Furthermore, we examine the impact of female leadership on overall female faculty representation. Material and Methods A total of 265 (97%) actively accredited MO [146 of 153], RO [93 of 94] and SO [27 of 27] training programs in the United States were included. The gender of overall faculty and those in leadership positions (program director and departmental chair/division chief) of each program was determined using hospital websites. The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test was used to examine whether the observed proportions of females in leadership positions deviate significantly from the expected proportion based on the actual proportion of overall female faculty in MO, RO and SO. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare rates of female faculty representation across each program based on the presence/absence of a female in a leadership position for MO, RO and SO. Results A total of 6,030 faculty were identified. Total female faculty representation in MO, RO and SO was 37.1% (1,563/4,215), 30.7% (389/1,269) and 38.8% (212/546), respectively. Female representation in leadership positions was 31.4% (83/264), 17.4% (31/178) and 11.1% (5/45), respectively. The observed proportion of females in leadership positions was significantly lower than the expected proportion of females in leadership positions for RO (p<0.001) and SO (p<0.001), but not MO (p=0.057). When restricting for only the Chair position, female representation was 21.7% (30 of 138), 11.7% (11 of 94) and 3.8% (1 of 26) in MO, RO and SO, respectively. On subset analysis, the observed proportion of females in Chair positions deviated significantly from the expected value for all three disciplines (p<0.001). 47.9%, 33% and 18.5% of MO, RO and SO programs had >=1 female in a leadership position, respectively. Programs that had a female in a leadership position had a higher mean percentage of overall female faculty than those that did not: 41.0% vs 35.0% (p<0.001), 36.0% vs 26.0% (p<0.001) and 39.0% vs 32.0% (p=0.292) for MO, RO and SO, respectively. Conclusion Gender disparity exists in academic MO, RO and SO faculty, which is magnified at the leadership level. Programs with a female physician in a leadership position were associated with a higher percentage of female faculty.

REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL TRIAL LEADERSHIP PUBLISHED BY HIGH-IMPACT MEDICAL JOURNALS,Denby K.; ; Szpakowski N.; Silverman J.; Walsh M.N.; Nissen S.E.; Cho L.,"Background Cardiology has lagged behind numerous other specialties regarding the representation of women physicians in the specialty. This study is aimed at evaluating the equitable inclusion of women in the leadership of major cardiology clinical trials. Methods We identified all cardiovascular medicine trials published over 5 years (2014-2018) by three high-impact journals - NEJM, JAMA, and The Lancet. Emergency medicine, surgical, and cardiac anesthesia studies were excluded. We evaluated the gender of first and senior authors and steering committee members as a surrogates of trial leadership. Gender was determined by online searches and confirmed by two researchers. Other information collected included affiliation with industry or academia, and academic qualifications. Results Of 200 trials identified, representation of women in steering committees averaged 10.3%. In 83 (41.5%) trials there were no women on the steering committee and 181 (90.5%) had <25% women. 111(55.5%) trials had no women physicians in the steering committee and 120 (60%) had no women physicians outside of industry. Review of authorship indicated women comprised 9.2% of first authors and 10% of senior authors. This disparity was greater in procedural (EP or interventional) subspecialties compared to nonprocedural subspecialties.

Is Academic Medicine Making Mid-Career Women Physicians Invisible?,Lewiss R.E.; ; Silver J.K.; Bernstein C.A.; Mills A.M.; Overholser B.; Spector N.D.,"In this perspective piece, we describe a multifactorial phenomenon whereby academic women physicians become invisible in the mid-career stage. Barriers, both small and large, cause a cumulative inequity effect, and women may leave academic medicine. Certainly, family and lifestyle choices play a role. And as we describe, so is a situation created where women become discouraged and disillusioned. We describe the growing evidence of subtle disparities, or micro-inequities, that cause women to be less visible and marginalized. Over time, early career women transition to mid-career with an accumulation of these micro-inequities. Women have more difficulty in building their academic portfolios and curriculum vitae-core components of academic promotion. They comprise greater than 50% of the health care workforce; yet, they are underrepresented in top leadership positions. For example, only 22% of full professors, 18% of department chairs, and 17% of medical school deans are women. Macro-inequities, which are observable and measurable, are also well documented. For example, women receive less compensation than men for the same job. We examine the contributing and causative processes and offer suggestions on how to promote equity among highly qualified mid-career women as they graduate from training and move beyond the early career stage.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2020,/,Journal of Women's Health,29,2,187EP  - 192,630976801,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.7732,31593525,#322,Lewiss 2020,"",""

We calculated descriptive statistics for all chairs and performed bivariate and multivariate analysis for gender differences in qualifications and achievements Results: Of the 179 eligible chairs, 87 CVs (49% response rate) were obtained, including 12 current and 6 former female chairs. A majority (86.2%) selfidentified as white/Caucasian. Median years since residency and first chair appointment were 25 and 7, respectively. Nearly half (46%) were chief residents, and a minority completed additional postgraduate degrees (31%) or fellowship (21.8%). At the time of chair appointment, 57% were full professor and 52% were in ED operations . A plurality (41%) served as Vice Chair. Women were more likely to be in educational (61 vs. 36%) than operational (22 vs. 52%, p=0.01) roles prior to appointment, and less likely to be chair at the program where they completed residency (5.6 vs. 23%, p=0.05). Women chairs had attained more additional degrees (44 vs 31%, p=0.04), non-federal grant awards (median 7 vs 3, p=0.04), and national leadership positions (median 4 vs. 1, p=0.02) prior to chair appointment. There were no gender differences in completion of fellowships, leadership training programs, publications, federal grants, awards, or national and international lectures prior to chair appointment, even after adjusting for years in practice <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite the fact that a majority of chairs held leadership roles in ED operations prior to chair appointment, only 1 in 5 female chairs were in operations, suggesting a major difference by gender in the path to chair attainment. These differences may contribute to persistent gender disparities in leadership, and may be explained by differences in career choice, implicit bias, and gender stereotyping.",2020,/,Academic Emergency Medicine,27,Supplement 1,S106EP  - S107,632418580,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acem.13961,,#325,Sethuraman 2020,"",""
"Gender Composition and Trends of Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia Editorial Board Membership: A 33-Year Analysis, 1987-2019",Pagel P.S.; ; Freed J.K.; Lien C.A.,"Objective: Gender disparities in editorial board composition exist in the vast majority of specialties including anesthesiology. If a similar lack of gender parity exists in cardiothoracic anesthesiology is unknown. The authors examined the gender composition and trends of the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (JCVA) editorial board from the initial year of its publication (1987) to 2019. The authors tested the hypothesis that the proportion of women serving on the JCVA editorial board has steadily increased over the journal's history, but women are underrepresented compared with the percentage of those currently practicing academic cardiothoracic anesthesia in the United States (US). <ovid:br/>Design(s): Observational study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Internet analysis. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): All members of the JCVA editorial board, 1987-2019. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): The JCVA editor-in-chief, the associate editor-in-chief, associate editors, section editors, and general editors on the board were extracted from the masthead of a single issue from each calendar year. The years were divided into quartiles (1987-1995, 1996-2003, 2004-2011, and 2012-2019) to collect representative samples of editorial board composition for analysis. <ovid:br/>Measurements and Main Results: A total of 2,797 members of the JCVA editorial board were positively identified (2,477 [88.6%] men; 310 [11.1%] women); 10 (0.3%) editors could not be identified. Four hundred and fourteen associate and section editors were recorded (men 360 [87.0%], women 54 [13.0%]). There were also 2,353 general editors (2,087 [88.7%] men; 256 [10.9%] women). The total number of JCVA board members, associate and section editors, and general editors progressively increased from 1987 to 1995 to 2012 to 2019. The percentage of women serving on the editorial board increased from 2.5% to 15.8%. Increases in the proportion of female general editors from 2.9% to 16.2% were responsible for this overall increase. A gender gap between the percentage of female first authors (data obtained from a previous publication) and editorial board members was observed in each quartile. Editorial board composition was also different than last author distribution in 1987 to 1995 and 2012 to 2019, but not the other 2 time periods. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results demonstrate that the proportion of women serving on the JCVA editorial board has steadily increased over the journal's history. Nevertheless, women continue to be underrepresented on the JCVA board compared with the percentage of US female academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists, and gender gaps between first and last authorship and board composition also persist.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2019,/,Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia,33,12,3229EP  - 3234,2002546518,https://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2019.07.139,31412981,#328,Pagel 2019,"",""
"Gender Differences in Authorship in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia: A 28-Year Analysis of Publications Originating From the United States, 1990-2017",Pagel P.S.; ; Freed J.K.; Lien C.A.,"Objective: Gender-based differences in scholarship among cardiothoracic anesthesiologists have not been studied. The authors examined the gender distribution of authorship of original research articles, case reports, review articles, and editorials in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (JCVA) originating from the United States during four 3-year intervals to determine temporal changes in productivity of women in cardiothoracic anesthesiology. The authors tested the hypothesis that scholarly output of women has increased progressively in JCVA over time concomitant with greater participation in first, last, and corresponding author roles. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Observational study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Internet analysis. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Authors of research articles, case reports, review articles, and editorials published in JCVA in 1990-92, 1999-2001, 2008-10, and 2015-17. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): None. <ovid:br/>Measurements and Main Results: The gender of each author was determined by inspection of the first name. If gender could not be established easily, the author's institutional website was examined or an internet search using the Google search engine was conducted. First, last, and corresponding authors as well as coauthors were noted for each article. A total of 1,195 publications with 4,982 authors (1,032 women; 20.7%) were examined. Gender was identified positively in 98.5% of authors. Women were first, last, and corresponding authors on 22.4%, 10.3%, and 14.6% of publications, respectively. The percentage of women who were authors increased from 12.1% in 1990-92 to 20.9% in 1999-2001 (p < 0.05), but plateaued in 2008 to 2010 (22.3%) and 2015 to 2017 (22.9%). Greater percentages of women were first authors (26.2%), senior authors (11.8%), and corresponding authors (16.6%) in 2015 to 2017 compared with 1990 to 1992 (9.6%, 7.0%, and 8.7%, respectively; p < 0.05 for each). The contributions of women to research articles and case reports were primarily responsible for these observed increases, although women also made a substantial impact with review articles in 2015 to 2017. The percentage of publications that included at least 1 female author in any capacity increased in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05) from 31.0% (1990-1992) to 74.4% (2015-2017). The proportion of female first or last authors (35.0%) appearing in JCVA during 2015 to 2017 was modestly higher than the current percentage of female cardiothoracic anesthesiologists practicing in departments with accredited fellowship programs (29.1%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results indicate that scholarly output of women rose in JCVA over time, but gains in productivity have plateaued more recently.

Implicit gender bias among US resident physicians,Hansen M.; ; Schoonover A.; Skarica B.; Harrod T.; Bahr N.; Guise J.-M.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to characterize implicit gender bias among residents in US Emergency Medicine and OB/GYN residencies. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We conducted a survey of all allopathic Emergency Medicine and OB/GYN residency programs including questions about leadership as well as an implicit association test (IAT) for unconscious gender bias. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the Likert-type survey responses and used standard IAT analysis methods. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that were associated with implicit bias. We conducted a subgroup analysis of study sites involved in a multi-site intervention study to determine if responses were different in this group. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Overall, 74% of the programs had at least one respondent. Out of 14,234 eligible, 1634 respondents completed the survey (11.5%). Of the five sites enrolled in the intervention study, 244 of 359 eligible residents completed the survey (68%). Male residents had a mean IAT score of 0.31 (SD 0.23) and females 0.14 (SD 0.24), both favoring males in leadership roles and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). IAT scores did not differ by postgraduate year (PGY). Multivariable analysis of IAT score and participant demographics confirmed a significant association between female gender and lower IAT score. Explicit bias favoring males in leadership roles was associated with increased implicit bias favoring males in leadership roles (r = 0.1 p < 0.001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): We found that gender bias is present among US residents favoring men in leadership positions, this bias differs between male and female residents, and is associated with discipline.

Dissecting disparity: Improvements towards gender parity in leadership and on the podium within the Canadian Orthopaedic Association,Hiemstra L.A.; ; Wittman T.; Mulpuri K.; Vezina C.; Kerslake S.,"Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to analyse the 15-year trend of women in leadership roles within the Canadian Orthopaedic Association (COA). This included not only leadership positions at the committee level in the association but also the more visible podium positions in the annual meeting programme: research podium and poster presentations, session moderators, panellists and faculty. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data on the numbers of male and female members were gathered from COA membership records for the most recent 5 years (2014-2018), as well as for 10 years previous (2009) and 15 years previous (2004). Male and female representation on COA committees, as well as the number of presenters at the annual meeting was calculated. Descriptive data were generated to compare the changes in gender representation over time. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In Canada, in 2018, 11.2% of orthopaedic surgeons were female. Within the COA, 17.6% of the members are female, with active female surgeons comprising 11.6% of the total membership. The largest increase in representation of women within the COA is in the trainee category which is 25.3% female. At the 2018 annual meeting, 25% of the attendees were women, with 22% of all podium appearances by women. Not including research presentations, women participated as faculty in 11% of the appearances at the 2018 annual meeting. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In conclusion, gender parity is not yet a reality in Canadian orthopaedics; however, the number of females in leadership roles and on the podium is consistent with the current gender diversity within the COA membership. Further efforts will be required to improve gender diversity as well as to encourage female medical students to consider orthopaedics as a specialty.

Identifying Gender Disparities and Barriers to Measuring the Status of Female Faculty: The Experience of a Large School of Medicine,Kuo I.C.; ; Levine R.B.; Gauda E.B.; Bodurtha J.; Clements J.; Fivush B.; Ishii L.,"Background: Women in academic medicine are not attaining parity with men in several domains. This issue is not only one of fairness; some funding agencies are requesting data on gender benchmarking. However, most published reports on gender disparities have not included examination of trends or actionable recommendations to address them. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The Dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine charged the Committee on the Status of Women (CSW) with conducting a comprehensive review of gender equity. In 2014, the CSW identified key domains important for academic success and created a sustainable framework to monitor trends by gender. Utilizing data from multiple key sources, the CSW measured differences in the domains of academic promotion, leadership, and satisfaction. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Gender differences were present in each domain. Data were not centralized and not readily available for most domains. The CSW recommended strategies to address gender disparities and created a set of measurable recommendations to monitor progress.

Gender bending: A national perspective on leadership amongst female anesthesiologists in Canada,Lorello G.R.; ; Webster F.; Cil T.; Flexman A.,"Introduction Despite the 'feminization' of Medicine and the increasing number of female anesthesiologists in Canada,1 women remain underrepresented in the higher echelons of Medicine and in leadership positions.2,3 Stipulations to explain the pipeline effect have been described, but research in gender equity and equality in anesthesiology remains scarce. To address the gender disparity problem, elucidation of barriers and facilitators to leadership positions for female anesthesiologists is essential. We sought to determine facilitators and enablers to leadership positions in female anesthesiologists as well as concepts around gender as expressed by these women. Methods This study was approved by our institutional research ethics board; participants provided written, informed consent. This research project used qualitative methods sensitized by critical feminist theory.4 Purposeful stratified sampling was used, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff anesthesiologists in leadership positions until saturation was achieved. Interviews examined participants' beliefs and experiences around both gender and leadership concepts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and preliminary analysis of the semi-structured interviews occurred concurrently with data collection and was an iterative process. The team read each transcript in full, with initial open coding of the data; subsequently, a thematic analysis of the transcribed interview codes was conducted inductively to uncover broad, emergent themes. NVivo12 (QSR International, Australia) was used for crossreferencing and for thematic analysis. Results Seven female anesthesiologists practicing at tertiary-level academic centres individually participated in a semi-structured interview. Our iterative process identified six themes: gender as complexity and self-identification, voice and vision of leadership, mentorship: mutualistic relationship demonstrating respect-trust dualism, gender discrimination as a lived experience, acknowledgement of systemic bias, and self-underrepresentation of women. Overt discrimination is now emerging in forms of covert discrimination in academic anesthesiology. Female anesthesiologists reject gender discrimination for themselves yet discuss gender disparity, discrimination, harassment, and bias in third person. These women stumbled around gender discrimination, thereby illuminating that these issues remain pervasive in anesthesiology. These women also expressed mentorship as a social support system en route to leadership positions but voiced both external (e.g., held to higher standards) and internal (e.g., pregnancy, breast feeding) obstacles encountered. Conclusion Our qualitative study examining leadership barriers and catalysts in anesthesiology identified six key themes. Mentorship was viewed as a support system although gender discrimination was pervasive. These results identify critical areas for future research to increase female participation in leadership in anesthesiology.",2019,/,Canadian Journal of Anesthesia,66,2 Supplement,S347EP  - S349,631644552,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12630-019-01499-1,,#340,Lorello 2019,"",""
"Variable access to girl idols may negatively affect (VAGINA) academic pursuits: Women are under-represented in internal medicine, PCCM, and cardiology academic leadership",Purdon S.; ; Johnson-Paben R.; Medepalli K.; Glassberg Csete M.K.; Burnham E.L.; Gershengorn H.B.,"Rationale Although nearly half of U.S. medical students are women, internal medicine (IM) and many IM subspecialty physicians are predominantly men. Moreover, women in academia are less often authors or panelists. Sex of academic leaders at the specialist level is sparse, collected inconsistently, and difficult to obtain. We sought to characterize women's institutional leadership in academic IM nationally and to evaluate the association of women's leadership with specialty. METHODS Data from IM, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine (PCCM), and Cardiology (CV) leaders, including department chairs, division chiefs, and training program directors (PDs), were collected through internet searching (performed July-Sept, 2018). We focused on medical schools with identifiable affiliated residencies/fellowships listed on their websites; schools were excluded if training programs did not list the school on their website or training programs were community hospital-based. We used Chi-square and ANOVA testing to compare leadership sex across specialties and geographies (by American Hospital Association regions) and multilevel multivariable regression modeling (with clustering by site) to evaluate associations of specialty and geography with women's leadership (chairs/chiefs and, separately, PDs). RESULTS We identified 388 medical school-training program pairs (147 IM, 116 PCCM, and 125 CV); leader sex was unidentifiable in 24 (1 IM PD, 7 IM chairs, 5 PCCM and 11 CV chiefs). 13.7% (95% CI: 7.9% - 19.5%) of IM chairpersons were women; division chief sex differed by specialty with 10.8% (4.9% - 16.7%) of PCCM and 2.6% (0.0% - 5.6%) of CV being women (p=0.014). Chair/chief sex tended to vary by geography (Figure, p>0.05). PD sex differed by specialty with % women in IM at 39.7% (31.7% - 47.8%), PCCM at 30.2% (21.7% - 38.7%), and CV at 24.8% (17.1% - 32.5%), (p=0.028). After multivariable adjustment, the odds of having a woman chief/chair were lower in CV (odds ratio (95% CI) versus IM: 0.16 (0.05 - 0.58), p=0.005) but not PCCM (0.76 (0.34 - 1.67), p=0.49); there was no association with geography (p=0.29). The odds of having a woman PD were lower in CV (versus IM: 0.46 (0.26 - 0.81), p=0.008) but not PCCM (0.68 (0.40 - 1.18), p=0.17); no associations identified with woman chief/chair (p=0.87) or geography (p=0.48). CONCLUSIONS Women are underrepresented in U.S. IM, CV and PCCM academic leadership. The odds of women's leadership are notably decreased in CV (not PCCM) versus IM.

210 ADDRESSING GENDER DISPARITY: INCREASE IN FEMALE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM LEADERSHIP INCREASES GENDER EQUALITY IN PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND FELLOW RANKS,Sethi S.; ; Mendoza S.; Webb A.; Edwards J.S.; Kumar A.; Chae S.,"Women make up 15% of the total number of practicing gastroenterologists(GI)in the US. Despite this disparity, only 33% of current GI fellows are female. Increasing female GIs is a major goal of all 3 GI societies. It is known that gender disparity exists in the field of gastroenterology and women are underrepresented in the leadership ranks and trainee level at academic programs. Whether an increase in female leadership in academic medicine is associated with increase in female program directors and trainees is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship in GI. Data was collected via a standardized protocol from all 173 U.S. gastroenterology (G.I.)fellowship programs until October 2018 from program websites and supplemented by online surveys completed by program coordinators. Any missing info was collected by calling the program coordinators. Data was collected on gender and academic rank of program director, associate program director, division chief, chair of medicine, program size, academic center affiliation, number and academic rank of female faculty and geographic region. The association was assessed using a chi-square test or independent samples t-test. 86% of chairman positions, 82% of division chief, 76% of program director and 63% of associate program director positions were held by men. Forty three percent of programs did not have female representation at any leadership level. Presence of a female program director or female associate program director was associated with an increase in the number female fellows (4.03 females vs 3.20 males; p=0.076; 4.26 females vs 3.36 males p=0.041), respectively). Overall, the presence of a female in any leadership position led to an increase in the number of female fellows (4.04 males vs 2.87 males; p=0.007). If a GI division chief was male the program director was more likely to be male as well, 81% vs 18.8%. Conversely, having a female division chief was likely to lead to a more equitable PD representation, 54% female to 48% male (p value <0.0001, OR 5.03 95% CI 2.04-12.3). Furthermore, if either the internal medicine department chair or GI chief are female, the proportion of female PDs increase to 41% as compared to 19% if both are male (p value <0.0001, OR 2.99 95% CI 1.34-6.6)Women are significantly underrepresented in the number of practicing gastroenterologists, at all levels of leadership in GI fellowship programs and at the fellow level. Increasing females in fellowship leadership positions is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees.

Gender imbalance in authorship of veterinary literature: 1995 versus 2015,Giuffrida M.A.; ; Burton J.H.; Dechant J.E.; Winter A.,"Despite increasing representation of women in veterinary medicine, gender differences persist in pay and attainment of senior and leadership positions. In academia, scholarly publication is a measure of productivity and is emphasized in the promotion process. This study aimed to analyze gender differences in the authorship of veterinary research articles to understand factors that could influence women's advancement and standing in academic medicine. We hypothesized that the proportion of women authors would increase between 1995 and 2015 and be similar to employment rates of women in academia, and that gender differences would exist in authorship by species, veterinary specialty area, and role (junior versus senior author). We examined 2,086 articles published in eight prominent veterinary journals in 1995 and 2015, determined the gender of first authors, corresponding authors, and senior authors, and collected article information including study design, species, and veterinary specialty area. The proportion of women as first and corresponding author increased significantly between 1995 and 2015, and in both years studied, women authored a larger percentage of articles than the reported percentage of women working in academia. In 2015, women were first authors of 60.0% (95% CI 56.9-63.0) of articles but accounted for only 38.3% of senior authors (95% CI 33.4-43.3).

Creating a leadership curriculum for women in medicine: Women in leadership development (WILD),Keenan B.; ; Montgomery A.G.; Thakkar A.; Burke C.; Crossman H.; Hemmat S.; Klepper A.; Santhosh L.,"Needs and Objectives: Though women account for nearly half of US medical students and residents, they are underrepresented at higher levels in academic medicine. A lack of structured leadership skills curricula targeting women trainees contributes to this gap. The Women in Leadership Development (WILD) curriculum was therefore developed within the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with the goal of building community and providing leadership training for women trainees hoping to launch their careers in academic medicine. Setting and Participants: WILD serves women residents and fellows at UCSF. During the first two years of programming (2017 and 2018), a total of 77 trainees within the Department of Medicine attended a daylong WILD symposium. Based on the Symposium's success, a yearly longitudinal curriculum was implemented at the GME level for the 2018-2019 academic year, serving women trainees across all specialties. Description: The WILD Symposium is a daylong course with the objectives of skill-building, mentorship, and networking. Skill sessions focus on public speaking, conflict resolution, microaggressions, and advocacy, with presenters from both inside and outside of academic medicine. This year, we have expanded WILD to include monthly skill-building sessions for women trainees across specialties ("" WILD: Series"") as well as quarterly events for trainees within the Department of Medicine focused on networking and community building ("" WILD: IM""). Evaluation: Prior to implementation of the WILD Symposium, we conducted a needs assessment to survey women residents about their interest in a leadership course. 93% had some level of interest. Topic areas of interest included negotiation, CV development, self-promotion, communication, networking, work-life balance, and the art of ""saying no."" Of 77 participants surveyed after the event, over 90% agreed that participation in the symposium was a useful experience and would strongly recommend the session to other trainees. The public speaking session received the highest reviews. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: While challenges remain for women trainees in academic medicine, leadership training represents one possible solution to address gender disparities. The strong positive response to the WILD Symposium reinforced the need for improved leadership training among women residents and fellows at UCSF.",2019,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,34,2 Supplement,S794,629001575,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11606.1525-1497,,#347,Keenan 2019,"",""
A qualitative study on leadership experiences of women doctors in Korea,Kim S.H.; ; Kim B.-O.; Hong S.-W.; Shin H.-Y.,"This study was designed to explore women doctors' leadership experiences and to identify mechanisms of leadership development based on their experiences. Between November 1 and December 18, 2017 in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 women doctors whose professional roles included being the dean of a college of medicine director of a university hospital system director of a government institution, and member of the National Assembly. Twelve meaningful experiences were discovered, and 10 mechanisms and several action steps for developing women doctors' leadership were drawn from the interviews. Firstly women doctors' leadership experiences can be divided into 4 periods: experiences before entering medical school time during medical school, the training process, and experiences after completing board certification as a clinical specialist or PhD candidate. These periods were respectively designated as an unaffected leap, temporary break, involuntary interruption, and voluntary leap forward. Secondly, based on these results, 10 mechanisms for leadership development were identified. These included an intimate relationship with one's father, curiosity and concerns about various themes, accepting opportunities that arise, work-life balance from an individual perspective, promotion of social concerns regarding the under-representation of medical leaders, removal of traditional stereotypes about women doctors, remedies for invisible discrimination (glass ceiling) from a social perspective, as well as the provision of equal leadership experience and opportunities, the promotion of active mentoring, and the extension of formal and informal networks from an educational perspective. Currently, 25% of doctors are women, and they are not a token group any more. In order to resolve women's under-representation in medical leadership, practical and concrete efforts in individual, social, and educational domains, which are appropriate and adaptable to Korean culture, are needed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Korean Medical Association.",2018,/,Journal of the Korean Medical Association,61,2,101EP  - 110,620980724,https://dx.doi.org/10.5124/jkma.2018.61.2.101,,#350,Kim 2018,"",""

Gender trends in authorship of spine-related academic literature-a 39-year perspective,Sing D.C.; ; Jain D.; Ouyang D.,"Background Context Despite recent advances in gender equity in medicine, the representation of women in orthopedic and neurosurgery remains particularly low. Furthermore, compared with their male colleagues, female faculty members are less likely to publish research, limiting opportunities in the academic promotion process. Understanding disparities in research productivity provides insight into the ""gender gap"" in the spine surgeon workforce. Purpose This study aims to determine the representation and longevity of female physician-investigators among the authors of five spine-related research journals from 1978 to 2016. Study Design This is a retrospective bibliometric review. Methods The authors of original research articles from five prominent spine-related journals (European Spine Journal, The Spine Journal, Spine, Journal of Spinal Disorders and Techniques, and Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine) were extracted from PubMed. For authors with a complete first name listed, gender was determined by matching first name using an online database containing 216,286 distinct names across 79 countries and 89 languages. The proportion of female first and senior authors was determined during the time periods 1978 to 1994, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, 2005 to 2009, and 2010 to 2016. The authors who had their first paper published between 2000 and 2009 were included in additional analyses for publication count and longevity (whether additional articles were published 5 years after first publication). Student t test, chi-square analysis, and Cochran-Armitage trend test were used to determine significance between groups. Results From 1978 to 2016, 28,882 original research articles were published in the five spine-related journals. A total of 24,334 abstracts (90.9%) had first names listed, identifying 120,723 authors, in total of which 100,286 were successfully matched to a gender. A total of 33,480 unique authors were identified (female authors: 31.8%). Female representation increased for first and senior authors from 6.5% and 4.7% (1978-1994) to 18.5% and 13.6% (2010-2016, p<.001). Growth in female senior author representation declined after 2000 (12.3% vs. 12.9% vs. 13.5% between 2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2016). Compared with male authors, on average, female authors published fewer articles (mean: 2.1 vs. 3.3, p<.001). Of 15,304 authors who first published during 2000 to 2009, 3,478 authors (22.7%) continued to publish 5 years after their first publication. Female authors were less likely to continue publishing after their first article (15.3% of female authors vs. 24.8%, p<.001). Conclusions Female representation in academic spine research has doubled over the past 4 decades, although the growth of female representation as senior author has plateaued. Female physician-investigators are half as likely to continue participating in spine-related research longer than 5 years and on average publish half as many articles as senior author. In addition to recruiting more women into research, efforts should be made to identify and address barriers in research advancement and promotion for female physician-investigators.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2017,/,Spine Journal,17,11,1749EP  - 1754,617512059,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2017.06.041,28673828,#354,Sing 2017,"",""
The Fermi Paradox in STEM-Where Are the Women Leaders?,Daldrup-Link H.E.; ,"This commentary summarizes insights and discussions about the status of women leaders in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and medicine). While many academic institutions now train close to 50 % female students in STEM disciplines, there is a major underrepresentation of qualified women in leadership roles. Women are admitted to the basements of STEM institutions, but only few make it to the top floor. We see male superstars receiving well-deserved recognitions and advancements. Unfortunately, their female counterparts are often held back or cut down by both male and female colleagues. Increasing reports of acts of discrimination reported by women in STEM fields are a symptom. Unilateral hierarchy is the root cause. Just increasing the quote/proportion of women and underrepresented minorities at an institution is therefore not enough to address the underlying problem. At Stanford Radiology, we started a major initiative to increase the representation of qualified women and other underrepresented minorities in our leadership teams in order to ensure that every member of the Department has an advocate at the leadership table, when decisions are being made. Diverse leadership teams are vital to creating a culture of respect and inclusion for everyone.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017, World Molecular Imaging Society.",2017,/,Molecular Imaging and Biology,19,6,807EP  - 809,618364368,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-017-1124-4,28924727,#355,Daldrup-Link 2017,"",""
"Gender differences in faculty rank, departmental leadership, and research output amongst hematology/oncology faculty in United States",Riaz I.B.; ; Siddiqi R.; Fatima K.; Khan M.S.; Zahid U.; Khosa F.,"Objective: Gender disparity in academic medicine remains a contentious topic of debate. Female faculty is underrepresented in leadership positions and reportedly has fewer publications, lower h-indices and grant funding. We sought to study the gender differences in faculty rank, departmental leadership and research output amongst academic hematologists/oncologists in United States. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We obtained a list of clinical faculty at 146 hematology/oncology fellowship programs using Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) and program websites( February 2017). We further collected data on demographics, academic rank and research output for each faculty member on our list by searching Doximity and Scopus databases. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 2161 academic hematologists/oncologists were included in the final analysis. Women were particularly underrepresented at senior faculty ranks, making up one-fifth (22%; n=142) of full professors, one-third (36%; n=169) of associate professors, and half (45%, n=415) of assistant professors. 30% (n=70) of departmental leaders were women. Female faculty on average had a lower mean h-index (12.1 versus 20.9; p<0.001), but also had fewer years of professional experience. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender disparity exists in senior ranks of academic hematology/oncology.

Gender at the head of the bed: Does gender bias exist in the evaluation of emergency medicine residents' leadership skills during medical resuscitations?,Weichenthal L.A.; ; Campagne D.; Sawtelle S.; Ives C.; Comes J.,"Study Objectives: One of the most challenging skill sets emergency medicine (EM) residents must develop during training is to become competent team leaders (TL) during critical medical resuscitations. Although medical knowledge and technical skills are required to be an effective TL, non-technical skills including leadership, communication, and teamwork behavior are also crucial. Research exists that suggests that implicit gender bias may impact the evaluation of female residents, especially in agentic specialties such as EM. The purpose of this is to see if gender bias exists in the way that EM residents are evaluated by EM nurses and faculty in their role as TL during medical resuscitations. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Two of the principle investigators (LW, DC) reviewed twenty videotaped medical resuscitations and from these chose four (two with female residents as TL and two with males) as well run resuscitations. They then individually rated these videos using a previously validated score sheet for leadership skills during resuscitations. When the two investigators ratings for the videos were compared, there was very good inter-rater agreement with a kappa > 0.72. These videos were then observed by groups of EM nurses and attending physicians. These observers were asked to the same scoring sheet and were also asked to circle adjectives that they felt described the TL. Observers were blinded to the purpose of the study. Data from the score sheets was entered into Excel by one investigator (LW). Both qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed on the data. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The video resuscitations performed by female EM residents were seen by 83 EM nurses and faculty whereas the resuscitations performed by male EM residents were watched by 94. There was no significant difference in how the male and female residents were rated as TLs (2.25 versus 2.38, p=0.75). However, interesting trends appeared when analyzing the adjectives used to describe the residents. Male and female residents were equally likely to be called authoritative, self-confident, and assertive. Female residents, however, were more likely to be identified as active and collaborative. Only male residents were described as cold and only female residents were described as impatient. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female and male EM residents were viewed as being equally effective as leaders in this study. They were both seen to have important behaviors of leaders including self-confidence and assertiveness but female residents were more likely to be described as active and collaborative.",2017,/,Annals of Emergency Medicine,70,4 Supplement 1,S34,620857784,,,#361,Weichenthal 2017,"",""
Demographic and Personal Characteristics of Male and Female Chairs in Academic Psychiatry,Doyle M.; ; Pederson A.; Meltzer-Brody S.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the strong representation of female psychiatrists in residency and early-career positions, the number of female faculty sharply decreases in tenured or executive leadership positions. Why there exists a marked change in representation at the level of senior leadership within academic psychiatry is unclear. The authors investigated the causative factors contributing to this observation and gathered information about the personal characteristics of women in executive leadership roles., METHODS: The authors surveyed psychiatry chairs at academic institutions. They identified all female chairs and randomly selected a group of male chairs to serve as a control group. The survey assessed perceived barriers, strengths, and weaknesses and differences in demographics and leadership styles between female and male chairs., RESULTS: Ten percent of psychiatry chairs were female. Male chairs were more likely than female chairs to head large departments (p = 0.02, confidence interval (CI) -17.1-69.1) and had a higher H-index (p = 0.001, CI 6.6-37.2).

"Gender matters: Assessing disparities and promoting equity through improved resident communication, leadership, and negotiation",Mustapha M.; ; Rogers E.A.; Duffy B.; Gladding S.,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Gender disparities persist in academic medicine across leadership roles, promotion, and pay. Women comprise about half of US medical students, still academic medical centers have yet to close the gender gap that exists in associate and full professor ranks. Multiple studies have documented persistent gender disparities in academia: across senior level positions, promotion decisions, and salaries. Studies suggest that women who participate in leadership development curricula are more likely than their peers to attain deanships, department chairmanships, or full professorship. Despite these well documented needs, medical residents are rarely targeted for early interventions. To meet this need, we developed a resident curriculum addressing the interplay between gender and communication, leadership and negotiation. The overall curricular objective is to provide career development support to residents and promote career satisfaction and equity. By sharing our work, we hope attendees will be able to: 1) Recognize the need to address the influence of gender in GME 2) Perform an assessment for gender disparities amongst their own learners 3) Identify resources for building and delivering a curriculum to address needs SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents in Internal Medicine (90), Med-Peds (40) and Med-Derm (10) at the University of Minnesota (UMN). The curriculum is delivered during mandatory educational conferences and optional conferences. DESCRIPTION: In a needs assessment conducted among UMN medicine-pediatrics residents in spring 2015 (26 respondents of 39 total residents, 16 female), males more often than females reported positive experiences in communicating with ancillary staff (p = 0.02), and females more often than males had negative experiences in communicating with both consulting services and ancillary staff (p = 0.03 for each). There was a trend toward a difference in leadership, with males more often feeling their gender positively influenced opportunities for leadership and their teams' response to their own leadership style (p = 0.1). Overall, males felt their gender more positively affected their work experience (p = 0.001). From this assessment, we found that the male vs female difference was strongest for communication and leadership. Based on these data and literature review, we have developed and are implementing a resident curriculum that addresses the interplay between gender and communication, leadership, and negotiation. Our overall objective is to provide career development support to residents with a goal of promoting career satisfaction and equity. Our curriculum is innovative in two key ways: 1) designed specifically for residents instead of practicing physicians; 2) delivered to all residents-male and female- for broadening gender discussions, instead of many existing programs exclusively delivered to women. The curriculum includes interactive seminars in communication, leadership, and negotiation, focusing on knowledge acquisition, skill development, self-reflection and goal setting. Communication sessions focus on: different historical gender-based communication styles; strengths and weaknesses of these styles; and how clinical communication is affected by gender-based expectations. During leadership sessions, all residents complete a personality/skills assessment (StrengthsQuestTM) followed by an interactive ""debriefing"" on their individual results., Participants then create their own learning goals to implement during their next clinical rotations. In follow-up, senior residents attend an interactive workshop focused on different leadership styles to discuss their own experiences in leading a medicine team since their first leadership assessment. EVALUATION: The pilot phase of our curriculum focuses on the first two levels of Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model-measuring Reaction (how trainees react to the training) through individual post-session evaluations, and measuring Learning (how trainee knowledge has increased) through a pre-post curriculum knowledge assessment. Future assessments will study longer term learner outcomes. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Our needs assessment surprised us in a few ways. Though we expected gender disparities in communication and leadership, we were surprised that our small sample would reflect this so clearly. Additionally, several residents wrote about a lack of female role models, though the educational leadership in Medicine, Pediatrics, and Med-Peds is dominated by women. Male trainees also acknowledged disparate treatment based on gender and difficulty reconciling how to approach this disparity. The needs assessment data focused us on the topics of communication and leadership, but also clarified that the curriculum needed to include all genders, and it needed to include specific skill building and culture change. Initial seminar attendees have discussed intrinsic biases, ways in which both men and women can become victim to stereotype, and ways that individuals and groups can mitigate these disparities.",2016,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,31,2 SUPPL. 1,S821EP  - S822,72289520,,,#365,Mustapha 2016,"",""

Where are the boys. Using peer leadership to address barriers to male adolescent utilization of an urban school-based health center,Rafferty J.R.; ,"Purpose: Adolescent men have higher mortality and morbidity than their female peers resulting from many preventative conditions, including substance abuse, accidental injuries, and violence. However, use of primary care decreases as adolescent men age (opposite to the trend among females) and this gender disparity persists through adulthood. School-based health centers (SBHC) were established to target unmet adolescent health needs with accessible, low cost, comprehensive care. In theory, they address many barriers identified by adolescent males, but low utilization persists. Using the principles of community-based participatory research and peer leadership, a forumwas established at a selected urban high school aiming to empowering male student leaders in identifying and addressing relevant health issues and barriers preventing their demographic from accessing primary care, especially their SBHC. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The setting is a technology-focus pilot high school (within the public school system) with a state department of public health sponsored SBHC. Each year, seven to ten male students (sophomores or juniors) are selected by guidance counselors based on perceived leadership potential and academic eligibility. Participants meet weekly with a SBHC clinician, research volunteer, and occasionally community leaders for 60 minute sessions to discuss health issues and barriers to SBHC use as identified by an annual school-wide survey. Participants are then encourage to collaborate in order to address these issues with the support and guidance of SBHC staff. The research volunteer moderates conversation, takes notes, and identifies common themes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Average weekly attendance was > 85%. In 2008, participants focused on barriers to adolescent male use of primary care, especially how perceptions of masculinity, such as ""toughness,"" discourages prevention while promoting violent/aggressive stereotypes. They advocated for a peer leadership program where male students learned leadership skills through open and respectful discussions of health issues with community leaders. This provides a foundation for peer interactions around healthy behaviors and decision-making. Piloted in 2011, the program has been refined through participant input. Topical discussions addressed the top issues identified by the annual survey (stress, sleep, violence, neighborhood safety, sports injuries, substance use and mental health). Participants also explored survey data demonstrating a preference for emergency room care over their SBHC, and top barriers to SBHC use (fear of parents finding out and peer judgment). Participants have addressed these issues by tabling to advertise SBHC services, classroom presentations, and advocating on behalf of SBHCs at the State Capitol. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Adolescents exert a powerful influence on the attitudes and behaviors of one another. A selected group of urban high school adolescent males designed a peer leadership program aimed at building leadership skills and health literacy.

Diversity begets diversity: A global perspective on gender equality in scientific society leadership,"Potvin, DA; Burdfield-Steel, E; Potvin, JM; Heap, SM","Research shows that gender inequality is still a major issue in academic science, yet academic societies may serve as underappreciated and effective avenues for promoting female leadership. That is, society membership is often self-selective, and board positions are elected (with a high turnover compared to institutions) - these characteristics, among others, may thus create an environment conducive to gender equality. We therefore investigate this potential using an information-theoretic approach to quantify gender equality (male: female ratios) in zoology society boards around the world. We compare alternative models to analyze how society characteristics might predict or correlate with the proportion of female leaders, and find that a cultural model, including society age, size of board and whether or not a society had an outward commitment or statement of equality, was the most informative predictor for the gender ratio of society boards and leadership positions. This model was more informative than alternatives that considered, for instance, geographic location, discipline of study or taxonomic focus. While women were more highly represented in society leadership than in institutional academic leadership, this representation was still far short of equal (similar to 30%): we thus also provide a checklist and recommendations for societies to contribute to global gender equality in science.",2018,,PLOS ONE,13,5,,WOS:000433634800025,10.1371/journal.pone.0197280,,#389,Potvin 2018,"",""

More Than a Joke: The Intersection of Gender-Based Humor and Gender Inequities Experienced by Women Department Chairs in Academic Medicine,"Hobgood, C; Marks, M; Choi, Y; Papini, NM; Draucker, C","Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study is to describe how women academic department chairs in emergency medicine, surgery, and anesthesiology experience humor in the workplace.Method: Interviews were conducted with 35 women department chairs in academic medicine from 27 institutions that aimed to describe women's leadership emergence. The data from the primary study yielded rich and revealing themes involving participants' experiences with humor in the context of their leadership roles, justifying a secondary analysis focusing specifically on these experiences. Relevant remarks were extracted, coded, and summarized.Results: Participants discussed two broad types of humor-related experiences. First, they described how they responded to aggressive gender-based humor directed at themselves or their colleagues by tolerating it or expressing disapproval. This humor includes demeaning quips, insulting monikers, sexist jokes, and derogatory stories. Participants often did not confront this humor directly as they feared being rejected or ostracized by colleagues. Second, they described how they initiated humor to address gender-related workplace issues by highlighting gender inequalities, coping with sexual harassment and assault, and managing gender-based leadership challenges. Participants felt constrained in their own use of humor because of the need to be taken seriously as women leaders.Conclusion: Women leaders in academic medicine use humor to confront gender-related issues and experience aggressive gender-based humor in the workplace. The constraints placed on women leaders discourage them from effectively confronting this aggressive gender-based humor and perpetuating gender inequities. Eliminating aggressive gender-based humor is needed to create safe and equitable work environments in academic medicine.",2024,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,33,7,948-955,WOS:001228585800001,10.1089/jwh.2023.1006,,#398,Hobgood 2024,"",""

Barriers and Facilitators for Female Healthcare Professionals to Be Leaders in Pakistan: A Qualitative Exploratory Study,"Iftikhar, S; Yasmeen, R; Khan, RA; Arooj, M","Purpose: Despite being in high numbers in medical colleges, only a small proportion of women join the workforce and even fewer reach leadership positions in Pakistan. Organizations like United Nations and Women Global Health are working towards closing the gender gap. The study aims to explore the enablers and barriers for women in healthcare leadership and to explore the strategies to promote women in leadership positions in Pakistan's specific societal culture. Methods: In this qualitative exploratory study, semi-structured interviews of 16 women holding leadership positions in the health-care profession, ie, medical and dental (basic or clinical sciences) were included. The data were collected until saturation was achieved. The data were analyzed in MS Excel. Deductive and Inductive thematic analysis was done.Results: Thirty-eight codes were generated that were combined in the form of categories. The major themes that emerged from the data were: elevating factors, the shackles holding them back, let us bring them up and implicit bias. Elevating factors were intrinsic motivation and exceptional qualifications, while the shackles were related to gender bias, male insecurities, and lack of political background. It was noteworthy that differences in gender roles were highly defined by culture and religion.Conclusion: There is a need to change the perception of South Asian society and redefine gender roles through media and individual attempts.

"Institutions Developing Excellence in Academic Leadership (IDEAL) A partnership to advance gender equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic STEM","Bilimoria, D; Singer, LT","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the objectives, activities and outcomes of the National Science Foundation ADVANCE project, Institutions Developing Excellence in Academic Leadership (IDEAL) during 2009-2012. The goal of IDEAL was to create an institutional learning community empowered to develop and leverage knowledge, skills, resources and networks to transform academic cultures and enhance gender equity, diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines at six research universities in the northern Ohio region. Over the three-year period, these institutions developed academic leaders and institutionalized gender equity transformation through multi-dimensional and multi-level initiatives, improving the advancement and leadership of women faculty in STEM disciplines. Design/methodology/approach The authors describe the objectives, activities and outcomes of the NSF ADVANCE project, IDEAL during 2009-2012. The six research institutions included in IDEAL were Bowling Green State University, Case Western Reserve University (the lead institution), Cleveland State University, Kent State University, University of Akron and University of Toledo. Findings IDEAL's outcomes included the institutionalization of a number of gender equity initiatives at each university, an increase in the number of tenured women faculty in science and engineering disciplines over three years across the six universities, and increases in the numbers of women in faculty and administrative leadership positions. Out of 62 of the IDEAL participants (co-directors and change leaders), 25 were promoted or appointed to roles of leadership within or beyond their institutions during or after their participation in IDEAL.

The politics of knowledge: the responses to feminist research from academic leaders,"van den Brink, M","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge on the slow gender change in academia by examining university leaders' defensive patterns of responses to feminist knowledge. Identifying the most common responses will enable scholars and practitioners engaged in equality work in academia to anticipate them and implement specialized interventions to target these arguments.Design/methodology/approach - The author developed a reflexive, composite methodology, combining participatory action research, documentary analysis and auto-ethnography. It is an explorative study, based on author's own interpretations and experiences while talking about gender inequality issues in the academic setting. Data are drawn from discussions stemming from public lectures and encounters in the academic setting where academic leaders were present between 2009 and 2015.Findings - Three patterns of responses are identified: two defensive patterns and one which provides opportunities for change. The two defensive responses resisted the feminist knowledge on the basis of methodology/epistemology or the study's findings. The pattern of commitment shows promising opportunities for change.Research limitations/implications - For future research, it could be interesting to further explore the role of leaders in gender equality work. The author examines leaders who are gender aware and analyze how they champion gender equality in their organizations and what actions they take to increase equality. The actual leadership work that has to be done to create gender equal or inclusive work places is an under researched premise.Originality/value - Hitherto, little is known about the way the feminist knowledge is received within in the academic community.

What's the fuss? Gender and academic leadership,"Wong, A; McKey, C; Baxter, P","Purpose - Women continue to be disproportionately represented in top leadership positions. Leadership development programs typically focus on skills attainment. The purpose of this paper is to explore the perceptions and experiences of academic leaders in order to inform how leadership development programs may more effectively address the gender gap in leadership.Design/methodology/approach - A sequential mixed methods study design was used. Participants completed the Leadership Practice Inventory (R)(LPI) survey followed by individual interviews of a subset of participants. The survey results were analyzed and compared by gender using the t-test. Thematic analysis was used to compare themes across and between genders. Quantitative and qualitative findings were integrated in the final analysis.Findings - In total, 65 leaders (38 women; 27 men) (37.7 percent response rate) participated in the survey. There were no significant demographic or statistical differences between women and men on any of the LPI (R) components. Five women and five men were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed common leadership aspirations and values. Gender differences were noted in leadership attainment, mentorship and the influence of gender on leadership. While the male narratives reflected cognitive awareness of gender inequities, the female narratives also included lived experiences. Male participants focused on the importance of meritocracy whereas the female participants emphasized the gendered social and structural influences on leadership attainment.Practical implications - Leadership development programs need go beyond generic ""skills-building"" in order to conceptualize leadership within a gendered social context. This framework will enable critical awareness and tools for developing both women and men's fullest leadership potential.Originality/value - This study was conducted in order to better understand how academic health leaders experience the intersection of gender and leadership.

The under-representation is particularly common in higher education organizations, including medical and dental schools. The current study aimed to investigate gender-based distribution and explore leaders' experiences in the medical and dental institutes in a developing country, Pakistan. Methods A mixed-method approach was used. Gender-based distribution data of academic leaders in 28 colleges including 18 medical and 10 dental colleges of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan were collected. Qualitative data regarding the experiences of academic leaders (n = 10) was collected through semi-structured interviews followed by transcription and thematic analysis using standard procedures. Results Gender-based disparities exist across all institutes with the greatest differences among the top-rank leadership level (principals/deans) where 84.5% of the positions were occupied by males.

A Qualitative Analysis of Career Advice Given to Women Leaders in an Academic Medical Center,"Farrugia, G; Zorn, CK; Williams, AW; Ledger, KK","Question What advice regarding the workplace and management strategies are perceived as useful to women leaders in academic medicine? Findings In this qualitative study based on responses from 40 women leaders at the Mayo Clinic, we found that advice could be grouped into 4 categories: leadership styles are perceived as having gendered qualities, a strategic process is required to gain leadership skills, conflicts between personal life and the workplace will occur and should not be a deterrent, and leadership pathways for women involve inevitable hurdles. Meaning The findings of this qualitative study suggest that a long-term view of attaining gender equity for women leaders at academic medical centers will require a combination of programs, including disruptive institutional initiatives and grassroots efforts; 1 approach involves highlighting and disseminating career advice received by female leaders, particularly advice that others have found helpful.Importance Women in academic medicine continue to face systemic obstacles on their paths to leadership. In addition to improving recruitment and advancement opportunities, academic medical centers must facilitate a cultural shift that ensures sustained leadership pathways for women. Objective To better understand, from the perspective of women leaders, the workplace and cultural changes that need to take place in academic medicine to increase inclusivity and gender equity. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study of 40 women physicians and administrators with senior leadership roles at Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit academic medical center and research institution with campuses in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota, examined participants' responses to a question regarding their paths to leadership. Replies were submitted between November and December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Women were asked to describe career advice (positive or negative) they had received that was the hardest to accept but, in retrospect, turned out to be valuable. Results Of 40 participants, 25 (63%) were physicians and 15 (37%) were administrators at Mayo Clinic; 27 (68%) had achieved the role of chair or the administrative equivalent. Career experience ranged from 6 to 40 years. Of the 40 women leaders queried, 38 (95%) provided written responses, which were separated into the 4 following categories: leadership styles are perceived as having gendered qualities, attaining leadership skills involves a strategic learning process, collisions between personal life and the workplace should not deter individuals from pursuing leadership roles, and leadership pathways for women involved hurdles. These categories represented a roadmap illuminating perceptions about the academic medical workplace. Conclusions and Relevance These findings link generalizable principles to help to drive new strategies for gender parity. Shifting the culture of academic medicine begins with fully understanding impediments to women's advancement.

Gendered in-role behaviours of Indonesian university leaders: Experiences and voices,"Arquisola, MJ; Rentschler, R","This study examines whether university leaders exhibit gendered in-role behaviors that are expected of leaders in a patriarchal society like Indonesia. A total of thirty-five university leaders (ULs) participated in this study. The study utilized a critical realist approach and found similarities and differences between cohort groups from conflict resolution, negotiating with people with power, linking with external networks, and getting rid of the presumption of incompetence and gender bias. Even though female ULs needed to balance internal and external perceptions of self, they showed assertiveness, depth of conviction and purpose, and a take-charge attitude. Male ULs manifested protective attitudes borne out of positional authority. This study provided a platform for leaders to discuss through lived experiences, the enablers and barriers of in-role behaviors. The most significant finding is that female ULs were hindered by a stifling bureaucracy and insufficient resource allocation.

Disparity in Leadership in Neurosurgical Societies: A Global Breakdown,"Shaikh, AT; Farhan, SA; Siddiqi, R; Fatima, K; Siddiqi, J; Khosa, F","OBJECTIVE: Gender disparity in academic and organizational settings has been the topic of numerous studies and they have tried to extract its causes using H-index as the prime metric. The primary objective of our study was to assess gender disparity in leadership positions in neurosurgical societies worldwide. A second objective was to evaluate scholarly output among neurosurgeons in neurosurgical societies worldwide, utilizing H-index as a predominant metric.METHODS: The World Federation of Neurosurgeons database was used to gather details on the neurosurgical societies present worldwide. Online data present for leadership positions were extracted from each of the respective societies. Neurosurgeons holding leadership positions were arranged according to their academic and hierarchical ranks. The Scopus database was used to calculate H-index along with other bibliometric variables.RESULTS: H-index was statistically significant between both genders, with male neurosurgeons having significantly higher H-index than female neurosurgeons. A positive correlation was also found between H-index and academic ranks of neurosurgeons. However, no statistical significance was found between H-index and executive committee positions. Female neurosurgeons held 29% executive committee positions globally.CONCLUSIONS: A paucity of female neurosurgeons was seen in leadership positions in neurosurgical societies worldwide. Significant disparity present in research productivity between genders is a highlighted statistic further discussed in this study, considering variables such as H-index among others.

Underrepresentation of women in the top hierarchy of academic medicine exists despite women comprising more than half of the medical school graduates and residency positions. The purpose of this study is to analyze and quantify the relationship of gender, research productivity, and career advancement in Canadian academic radiology departments.MATERIALS AND METHODS. Seventeen academic radiology departments with affiliated residency programs in Canada were searched for publicly available data on faculty to generate a database for gender and academic profiles of the radiologists. Bibliometric data were collected using Scopus archives. The associations of gender, academic ranks, and leadership positions were assessed, and a p value of <= 0.05 was defined as significant. Significant variables were analyzed using a multivariate linear regression model.RESULTS. Of 1266 faculty members, gender information and academic rank were available for 932 faculty members: 597 (64.05%) were men and 335 (35.95%) were women (chi 2 = 21.82; p < 0.0001).

Stories of women at the top: narratives and counternarratives of women's (non-)representation in executive leadership,"Baumann, H","There is ongoing debate on a global level about (the lack of) women in senior leadership. Despite years of discussion about the alleged advantages of gender diversity progress has been glacial: top management roles and senior positions of power throughout society remain largely the preserve of men. This critical review explores how women's power is narratively constructed in two dominant European cultures, Germany and Britain, and how stories told about women's representation in top level executive leadership may impact individual identities, possibilities and ambitions. Using thematic and discourse analysis, this article covers empirical research, academic writing, government reports, non-fiction and fictional writing, and some anecdotal evidence gathered by the author, who has executive experience spanning two decades in multinational corporations. For reasons of space, I focus on just three of the stories currently dominating the discussion about gender equality in business: first, the story that there is nothing or little left to fight for, the battle is won; second, the story that gender equality is straightforward because there is a business case for parity; and third, the story that women are not at the top because women choose not to run the world. Each of these has a counter narrative supported by empirical and anecdotal evidence, which I outline; nonetheless, I argue, they serve to maintain the status quo in leadership, reassuring those in power that they have no responsibility for (and therefore no responsibility seriously to address) the lack of women in top positions. I suggest on the basis of the evidence that the cultural narratives of Britain and Germany are remarkably similar and that the prospects of gender equality at the top occurring in our lifetime are dismal. A juxtaposition of the (contradictory) narratives paints a more holistic picture of the discursive sea we all swim in, relevant to scholars of gender equality and women's leadership across disciplines as well as government policy departments. As qualitative methodologies, narrative and discourse analysis cannot provide definitive answers. They can, however, provide a basis for reflecting on how dominant stories impact individuals and the cultural atmosphere.

However, data about the gender distribution of these positions are lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine the gender distribution of endowed positions at U.S. medical schools and identify strategies that have been used to promote investiture of women into these positions. Method The authors interrogated the websites for all U.S. medical schools for publicly available data. Of 38 schools that listed schoolwide information, they analyzed data from the 30 with at least 10 endowed positions. Then, they conducted interviews with deans of the 10 schools with the highest percentages of women holding endowed positions (""top 10"") to understand the strategies they used to increase gender equity in this area. Results The percentage of endowed positions held by women at the 30 schools analyzed ranged from 10.8% to 34.6%, with a mean of 21.6%. Themes that emerged from interviews with deans included (1) intentionality to identify women candidates in the selection process, (2) monitoring the numbers of women holding endowed positions, (3) inclusion of endowed positions as part of larger institutional goals on gender equity and diversity, (4) use of endowed positions to recruit, retain, and recognize women faculty, (5) purposeful fundraising to increase the number of endowed positions, and (6) institutional investment of resources to develop women faculty. Conclusions Analysis of the gender distribution of endowed positions across 30 representative U.S. medical schools revealed a significant gender disparity.

Although women have comprised most of the child neurology trainees since 2007, it is not apparent whether this demographic shift is reflected in the Child Neurology Society (CNS) awards and leadership. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in gender representation among leadership positions and award recipients within the CNS. The primary outcome measure was the total number of board of director (BOD) positions or awards given by gender each year. Methods A retrospective review of publicly available data was conducted on CNS members, post-training award recipients, and BOD positions, including nomination records, from 1972 to 2023. Data abstracted were restricted to gender to preserve member and nominee anonymity. Gender identification and consensus were determined through a combination of strategies and study members. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Pearson chi(2) test, and the exact binomial test to compare gender proportions and the probability of being underrepresented in awards, leadership, and nominations over time. Data are presented according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Results From 1972 to 2023, women represented 29% (44/152) of the BOD positions and 26% (61/236) of post-training award recipients presented by the CNS. Despite the increase in the proportion of women in child neurology, the overall gap in gender representation in leadership positions remains broadly stable. Only 13% (4/32) of CNS presidents have been women, a significant underrepresentation (95% CI 2.3%-52%, p < 0.004), although the representation of women in nonpresidential positions increased from 2003 to 2023. Women are also underrepresented as overall awardees (95% CI 12%-38%, p < 0.00001) except for the Philip R. Dodge Young Investigator Award, which is an investigator-initiated application. Discussion Women remain underrepresented at the highest levels of recognition in child neurology despite representing most of the field.

Women anesthesiologists' journeys to academic leadership: a constructivist grounded theory-inspired study,"Lorello, GR; Cil, T; Flexman, AM","Background Women continue to be underrepresented in academic anesthesiology, especially in leadership positions. Possible reasons for this gender disparity include family responsibilities, inadequate mentorship, lack of desire for leadership, the leaky pipeline effect (i.e., attrition of women physicians over the course of their career trajectories), and discrimination. Our objective was to understand the lived experiences of Canadian anesthesiologists in leadership positions. Methods In this constructivist grounded theory-inspired study, we used purposeful sampling to identify women anesthesiologists in leadership positions at one Canadian institution. Each participant underwent a one-on-one semi-structured interview of 40-60 min in length, sampling until theoretical saturation was reached. We included questions about the participant's practice setting, influences on their career, and advice the participant would provide to other women in leadership. We used an iterative approach to theoretical sampling and data analysis. The audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were transcribed and coded. NVivo12 was used for open and axial coding, and cross-referencing. Results Eight women anesthesiologists were recruited and interviewed. Our iterative process identified four interconnected themes: difficulty internalizing a leadership identity, identifying systemic barriers and biases, dissonance between agentic traits and communal social gender roles, and mentorship as shaping lived experiences. Participants consistently expressed experiencing discrimination, articulated barriers related to family responsibilities and ingrained societal expectations, and discussed how typical leadership traits are applied differently to women and men. Women perceived themselves as more compassionate and communicative than men. Despite these traits, these women have expressed barriers to obtaining mentorship.

NZES membership has now expanded to include many different contributors to ecology and conservation, from research scientists to conservation practitioners through to environmental policy analysts. Our aim was to examine how diversity in NZES has changed over time, either as a leader or a follower of trends in society. To do so, we analysed available data on NZES membership, governance structure, and awards, which reflect contemporary concerns about equality, matauranga Maori, and interdisciplinary science. We also searched articles in the New Zealand Journal of Ecology, using terms such as 'Maori', 'culture' and 'matauranga' to track the incorporation of indigenous views and matauranga Maori into New Zealand ecological research. Together, NZES membership, governance and awards show a shift in membership and governance towards greater gender equity. Early NZES governance and membership was dominated by men with some notable exceptions largely derived from the field of botany. However, the data provide only a sketchy picture of members, as neither ethnicity nor gender data are collected.

The interviews examined the leaders' perceptions of facilitators and barriers to their success. The authors analyzed the interviews using Acker's theory of gendered organizations as a theoretical framework, which explains embedded gender roles within work environments.Results Drawing on the theory of gendered organizations, the authors identified that participants described several facilitators to their success, including the availability of mentorship/sponsorship, inclusive leadership, and early and persistent exposure to women leaders in GME training and beyond. Because medicine's ideal worker was normed around the traditional roles of men, men observed and women experienced barriers to leadership success around issues related to childbearing, maternity leave, and microaggressions.Conclusions This study revealed that equitability for pediatric GME leadership in the military heavily relied on structures and support created by former leaders and mentors. Isolating these structures within a unique context of military academic medicine can illuminate physicians' experiences to address barriers and better support equitable leadership roles in both military and civilian academic medicine.",2024,,MILITARY MEDICINE,189,7-8,e1719-e1727,WOS:001144849900001,10.1093/milmed/usad489,,#471,Schulz 2024,"",""
"How Research, Teaching, and Leadership Roles are Recommended to Male and Female Engineering Faculty Differently","Judson, E; Ross, L; Glassmeyer, K","Across disciplines, male faculty spend more time on research than female faculty. Yet, women tend to teach and mentor students more hours than men (Misra et al. in Glob J Eng Educ 14(1):119-131, 2011). These disparities play pivotal roles in tenure and promotion decisions wherein research and leadership roles are most valued (Green in J Soc Work Educ 44(2):117-128, 2008). There is considerable evidence suggesting that implicit biases underpin some of these faculty roles differences, particularly in male-dominated disciplines, such as engineering. At the same time, there is limited evidence that, once aware of gender inequity, individuals will engage in bias correction in order to rectify prejudice. This study was designed to evaluate if implicit bias or bias correction could be detected when faculty considered the most appropriate roles for other faculty. Faculty from 50 colleges of engineering completed an activity wherein they assigned five fictitious engineering faculty characters to five assignments (one research, one leadership, and three teaching/advising roles). One version of the activity contained only male names; the other version was identical except for the change of the middle character's name from male (Charlie) to female (Cathy). Results indicated that both men and women were significantly more likely to select Cathy for both the leadership and research positions over Charlie. Regression analysis of the Cathy Group data indicated respondents' gender did not predict selection of Cathy to the leadership role; however, women were significantly more likely than men to select Cathy to do research.",2019,,RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,60,7,1025-1047,WOS:000487284500005,10.1007/s11162-018-09542-8,,#475,Judson 2019,"",""

Who is the next leader? Understanding women leadership development and succession planning in Saudi Arabian higher educational institutions,"Dahlan, DA","Leadership development and succession planning is a valuable strategy for closing the gender gap and providing an equal chance for males and females to be trained and involved in leadership roles. This strategy is an incredibly effective tool in higher education, where there is a significant disparity between male and female academic leaders. Despite its effectiveness, succession planning remained an overlooked component of the higher education system. Further research studies enhance our understanding of the current state of succession planning and the factors that affect the recruitment and selection of future academic leaders. Hence, this study aims to identify the current women's leadership development and succession planning practices in public and private universities in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative study was conducted in a Saudi Arabian higher education setting. The interest in Saudi Arabia stems from the fact that succession planning is less likely to be practiced since gender discrimination is apparent when assigning leadership positions. Results indicate that top powers typically select leaders since succession planning is absent in Saudi Arabia's higher education institutions. In this circumstance, networking and relationships play a significant role, as these institutions have no formalized succession planning process. In a highly gender-segregated society like Saudi Arabia, women are deprived of expanding their networks and showcasing capabilities to male decision-makers. The results of this study further identified the underlying components of the women's leadership and succession planning process in the Saudi Arabian setting. This study contributes to leadership and succession planning knowledge and its implications, which may extend opportunities for practitioners, consultants, and policymakers to include women in higher education succession planning.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,9,,,WOS:001349124900001,10.3389/fsoc.2024.1442543,,#492,Dahlan 2024,"",""

Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants' descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women's attitudes and their choice to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM.

In 2021, the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health conducted two virtual working groups for emerging women leaders to share challenges and suggest solutions to advance women's leadership in global health. In this paper, we present emerging themes from the working groups, provide a framework for the results, and discuss strategies for advancing women's leadership in global health.Objectives: The objective of this paper is to synthesize and share the themes of the two working group sessions to provide strategies for improving women's leadership training and opportunities in the field of global health.Methods: Approximately 182 women in the global health field participated in two virtual working group sessions hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health using the Zoom platform. Participants were divided into virtual breakout rooms and discussed pre-assigned topics related to women's leadership in global health. The participants then returned to share their ideas in a plenary session. Notes from the breakout rooms and transcripts from the plenary session were analyzed through a participatory and iterative thematic analysis approach.Findings: We found that the working group participants identified two overarching themes that were critical for emerging women leaders to find success in global health leadership. First, the acquisition of individual essential skills is necessary to advance in their careers. Second, the institutional environments should be setup to encourage and enable women to enter and succeed in leadership roles. The participants also shared suggestions for improving women's leadership opportunities such as including the use of virtual technologies to increase training and networking opportunities, intersectionality in mentorship and sponsorship, combatting impostor syndrome, and the importance of work-life balance.Conclusions: Investing in women and their leadership potential has the promise to improve health and wealth at the individual, institutional, and community levels.

Improving gender diversity at society meetings and panels may provide many benefits. Our aim was to determine the state of gender diversity amongst presenters and speakers at the annual Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (CSO) meetings.Methods Scientific programs for the CSO annual meetings from 2008 to 2020 were obtained from the national society website. Participant name, role, gender, location, and subspecialty topic were recorded for all roles other than poster presenter. Gender (male or female) was determined using an online search. The total number of opportunity spots and proportion of women was then calculated.

However, parity at the trainee level has yet to be accomplished, and surgical leadership positions have remained disproportionately biased toward men. To date, there have been no comparisons on the progress within plastic surgery and other surgical specialties. This investigates the gender disparity in resident and leadership representation over the past 10 years within surgical specialties and how these disparities compare to plastic surgery.MethodsCounts of female and male residents and surgical society leaders were collected from 2008 to 2018. Surgical fields included plastic, vascular, urologic, neurologic, orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. Leadership positions were defined as board seats on executive committees of major surgical societies or board associations. Data were acquired from publicly available sources or provided directly from the organizations. Resident data were obtained from the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education residents' reports. Individuals holding more than 1 leadership position within a year were counted only once.ResultsIn our aggregated analysis, the proportion of women in surgical leadership lags behind women in surgical residency training across all specialties (13.2% vs 27.3%, P < 0.01). General surgery had the highest proportion of female residents and leaders (35% and 18.8%, P < 0.01), followed by plastic (32.2% and 17.3%, P < 0.01), vascular (28.2% and 11.3%, P < 0.01), urologic (24.3% and 5.1%), and cardiothoracic surgery (20.5% and 7.8%, P < 0.01). Women in surgical leadership, however, increased at a faster rate than women in surgical training (11% vs 7%, P < 0.05). Plastic surgery showed the greatest rate of increase in both residents and leaders (17% and 19%, P < 0.05) followed by cardiothoracic surgery (16% and 9%, P < 0.05) and general surgery (8% and 14%, P < 0.05). For neurologic and orthopedic surgery, neither the difference in proportions between residents and leaders nor the yearly growth of these groups were significant.ConclusionsBetween 2008 and 2018, women in plastic surgery training and leadership positions have shown the most significant growth compared with other surgical subspecialties, demonstrating a strong concerted effort toward gender equality among surgical professions.",2023,,ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY,90,4,376-379,WOS:000974897100020,10.1097/SAP.0000000000002807,,#505,Yin 2023,"",""

We sought to describe the professional experiences and personal characteristics of academic radiation oncology (RO) chairs and to evaluate whether differences exist by gender.Methods and Materials: Anonymous surveys were distributed to 95 chairs of RO departments during the 2016 annual meeting of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs. The surveys included 28 closed-ended questions and the Leadership Practices Inventory. Results were analyzed by gender using chi(2) tests, ranksum, and t tests (significance P < .05).Results: A total of 72 chairs responded (61 male, 10 female, 1 declined to identify gender) for a response rate of 76%. There were no significant gender differences in age, academic rank, publications, or prior leadership positions held at the time of the first chair appointment, but female respondents held significantly greater total direct funding from extramural grants than their male counterparts (median, $1.89 million [interquartile range, $0.5-$5 million] vs $0.25 million [interquartile range, $0-$1.0 million]; P = .006). Women were more likely to have spouses employed outside the home at time of their first chair appointment than men were, with a trend toward women experiencing greater difficulty relocating. Men and women identified budgeting and resource allocation as their greatest professional challenges. There were no gender differences in the Leadership Practices Inventory-identified leadership domains or professional goals.Conclusions: Female RO chairs are as equally qualified as men in terms of productivity or leadership skills, but they face distinct challenges in the context of a gender-structured society. The observation of higher grant funding among women at the time of chair appointment suggests a possible need for interventions such as unconscious bias training to ensure that selection processes do not unnecessarily hold women to a higher standard.

Increasing Women in Leadership in Global Health,"Downs, JA; Reif, LK; Hokororo, A; Fitzgerald, DW","Globally, women experience a disproportionate burden of disease and death due to inequities in access to basic health care, nutrition, and education. In the face of this disparity, it is striking that leadership in the field of global health is highly skewed towards men and that global health organizations neglect the issue of gender equality in their own leadership. Randomized trials demonstrate that women in leadership positions in governmental organizations implement different policies than men and that these policies are more supportive of women and children. Other studies show that proactive interventions to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions within businesses or government can be successful. Therefore, the authors assert that increasing female leadership in global health is both feasible and a fundamental step towards addressing the problem of women's health. In this Perspective, the authors contrast the high proportion of young female trainees who are interested in academic global health early in their careers with the low numbers of women successfully rising to global health leadership roles. The authors subsequently explore reasons for female attrition from the field of global health and offer practical strategies for closing the gender gap in global health leadership. The authors propose solutions aimed to promote female leaders from both resource-wealthy and resource-poor countries, including leadership training grants, mentorship from female leaders in global professions, strengthening health education in resource-poor countries, research-enabling grants, and altering institutional policies to support women choosing a global health career path.",2014,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,89,8,1103-1107,WOS:000340286900011,10.1097/ACM.0000000000000369,,#508,Downs 2014,"",""
"Gender Differences in Academic Rank, Leadership, and Awards Among NIH Grant Recipients in Diagnostic Radiology","Yuen, J; Kulathaivelu, R; Hussain, M; Mutwiri, G ; Jutras, M; Patlas, M; Robbins, JB; Khosa, F","Objective: Females have been traditionally underrepresented in academia across multiple medical specialties, including radiology. The present study investigated primary investigators (PIs) who received National Institutes of Health (NIH) radiology funding between 2016 and 2019 to establish if there was a correlation between NIH grants, gender, academic rank, first and second tier leadership positions, geographic location, and professional awards. Materials and Methods: Funding information was obtained from the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditure and Results (RePORTER) website for 2016-2019. Information for each PI was obtained from academic institutional websites, LinkedIn, and Doximity. Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square analyses were performed to compare and determine associations between gender and the stated variables of interest. Results: Of the 805 radiology PIs included in this study, 78% were male. There was a significant association of gender with the attainment of the highest academic rank ( p = 0.026), with females occupied more of the assistant professor ranks ( M:F = 1:1.5) and less of the professor ranks (F:M= 1:1.2).

Association of Women Leaders with Women Program Director and Trainee Representation Across US Academic Internal Medicine,"Medepalli, K; Purdon, S; Bade, RM; Glassberg, MK; Burnham, EL; Gershengorn, HB","Background Women are underrepresented within internal medicine (IM). Whether women leaders attract women trainees is not well explored. Objective To characterize leader and trainee gender across US academic IM and to investigate the association of leader gender with trainee gender. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants Leaders (chairs, chiefs, program directors (PDs)) in 2018 and trainees (residents, fellows) in 2012-2016 at medical school-affiliated IM and seven IM fellowship programs. Exposure Leadership (chair/chief and program director; and, for resident analyses, fellow) gender. Main Measures Our primary outcome was percent women trainees (IM residents and, separately, subspecialty fellows). We used standard statistics to describe leadership and trainee gender. We created separate multivariable linear regressions to evaluate associations of leader gender and percent women fellows with percent women IM residents. We then created separate multivariable multilevel models (site as a random effect) to evaluate associations of leader gender with percent women subspecialty fellows. Key Results Our cohort consisted of 940 programs. Women were 13.4% of IM chairs and <25% of chiefs in each fellowship subspecialty (cardiology: 2.6%; gastroenterology: 6.6%; pulmonary and critical care: 10.7%; nephrology: 14.4%; endocrinology: 20.6%; hematology-oncology: 23.2%; infectious diseases: 24.3%). IM PDs were 39.7% women; fellowship PDs ranged from nearly 25% (cardiology and gastroenterology) to nearly 50% (endocrinology and infectious disease) women. Having more women fellows (but not chairs or PDs) was associated with having more women residents (0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5%) increase per 1% fellow increase, p<0.001); this association remained after adjustment (0.3% (0.1%, 0.4%), p=0.001). In unadjusted analyses, having a woman PD (increase of 7.7% (4.7%, 10.6%), p<0.001) or chief (increase of 8.9% (4.6%, 13.1%), p<0.001) was associated with an increase in women fellows; after adjustment, these associations were lost.

Factors that influence the implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in healthcare leadership: A meta-ethnographic study,"Mousa, M; Skouteris, H; Boyle, JA; Currie, G; Riach, K; Teede, HJ","Background Gender inequity in healthcare leadership persists and progress is slow, with the focus firmly on problems, barriers and on requiring women themselves to adapt and compete in a system not designed for them. Women are individually burdened to advance their careers, with little effort given to addressing systemic barriers in the health sector. A recent systematic review prioritised organisational-level approaches and demonstrated effective interventions. In this meta-ethnographic study, we further this work by examining factors in implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in leadership.Methods The meta-ethnographic framework applied here follows the Noblit and Hare approach for synthesising findings and applying interpretive analysis to original research. We generated a new line-of-argument with insights for the healthcare sector. The protocol is registered (CRD42020162115) on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Three academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS) were searched systematically between 2000 and 2021. Studies were analysed if they included organisational-level interventions that sought to measurably advance women in leadership. Study characteristics were extracted using a standard template for intervention details. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. Data synthesis was conducted across 19 criteria of the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guide (eMERGe).Findings Fifteen qualitative studies were included. Analysis revealed three meta-themes that are central to successful implementation of organisational interventions that advance women in healthcare leadership: (1) leadership commitment and accountability, influenced by internal and external organisational settings, salient for long term outcomes and for developing an inclusive leadership culture; (2) intervention fit with individuals with consideration given to personal beliefs, preferences, experiences, capabilities or life circumstances, including capacity for leadership roles in their broader life context; balanced against maintaining interventional fidelity, and (3) cultural climate and organisational readiness for change, addressing traditional, conservative and constrictive perspectives on gender and leadership in health, highlighting the facilitating role of male colleagues.Interpretation This meta-ethnographic research extends past work by integrating empirical evidence from a systematic literature review of effective organisational level interventions, with the identification of pragmatic themes to generate, implement, evaluate and embed evidence-based organisational interventions to advance women in healthcare leadership. This work can inform initiatives and policymakers to generate and implement new knowledge to advance women in healthcare leadership.Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ophthalmology Education Leadership Attitudes Toward Mentorship of Female Medical Students,"Paul, M; Dweck, M; Chadha, N","center dot PURPOSE: Numerous studies have emphasized the influence of gender-specific mentors in medical students' career decisions, but this has not been explored fully in ophthalmology. Therefore, this study evaluated ophthalmology educators' attitudes toward female mentorship, to better understand how this may relate to medical students' career development and training.center dot DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.center dot METHODS: A 22-question survey was sent to Associachairs, program directors (PDs), and medical student educators (MSEs). The number of female students applying to ophthalmology residency was compared to the number of female ophthalmology faculty using AUPO and Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) workforce data. Student t tests and x2 were used for analyses, all at a threshold significance level of P < .05.center dot RESULTS: 75 members responded, including 30 of 72 MSEs (41.7%), 34 of 114 PDs (29.8%), and 17 of 135 chairs (12.6%). Of respondents, 55.4% identified as female and 44.6% as male. Male and female members had 47.9% and 47.6% female mentees, respectively ( P = .45). However, 21.2% of male versus 56.1% of female members agreed that a mentee of the same gender was important ( P < .01).

Women in academic medicine leadership: correlation between sex of medical school deans and affiliated academic hospital system CEOs,"Marshall, AL; Durani, U; Mikhael, J","Background Women are currently under-represented in 'C-suite' leadership positions at academic medical centres, including medical school deans, department chairs and hospital chief executive officers (CEOs). There are many potential reasons for the low percentage of women in academic medical leadership, including lack of mentorship and sponsorship, increased non-work responsibilities compared with men, implicit bias, and others.Methods We collected data from 136 fully accredited US allopathic medical schools regarding sex of the medical school dean and sex of the CEO of the largest academic medical centre/teaching hospital affiliate. Schools where students rotate at non-academic centres were excluded from the final analysis, leaving 124 schools where we investigated the relationship between sex of US medical school dean and affiliated academic medical centre CEO.Results 16.9% of current medical school deans and 17.7% of affiliated academic medical centre CEOs were female.

Empowering global leaders through workplace sustainability: A case of Zambian leaders,"Daugherty, R; Zelihic, M; Deresa, C; Nga'mbi, HC; Ssekamatte, D","The African continent is experiencing a significant economic development characterised by many challenges as its emerging 21st-century leadership is finding its own path. Forceful and often uneven integration into the global economic system causes many of the issues that many African nations face. The leadership gaps, gender inequality, bias and multigenerational workforce coupled with inherent lack of strong institutions capable of driving the development agenda in the continent remain an impediment to a full realisation of responsible, accountable, relevant and ethical (RARE) leadership. This article presented two Fulbright quantitative descriptive research projects, which were presented at Mulungushi University in Kabwe, Zambia. The first Fulbright project aimed at educating Zambian faculty and students on how to develop leadership skills appropriate for the 21st-century workplace. The second one aimed at conducting a comprehensive assessment of the current Zambian leadership across 18 different industries. A mixed-methods approach was adopted for this study with a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire triangulated with focus group data from 246 Zambian leaders across 18 different industries. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, whilst qualitative data were analysed by thematic analysis. The results revealed that Zambian leaders face challenges of lack of proper talent management and poor infrastructure, effective mentoring and human resource gaps.

We distributed a multi-institutional survey to women faculty and residents to evaluate categorical characteristics contributing to success and differences between the two groups.Methods: An institutional review board-approved electronic survey was distributed to women faculty and residents at eight institutions and were completed anonymously. We created survey questions to assess multiple categories: determination; resiliency; career support and obstacles; career aspiration; and gender discrimination. Most questions used a Likert five-point scale. Responses for each question and category were averaged and deemed significant if the average was greater than or equal to 4 in the affirmative, or less than or equal to 2 in the negative. We calculated proportions for binary questions.Results: The overall response rate was 55.23% (95/172). The faculty response rate was 54.1% (59/109) and residents' response rate was 57.1% (36/63). Significant levels of resiliency were reported, with a mean score of 4.02.

Leadership gender disparity in the fifty highest ranking North American universities: Thematic analysis under a theoretical lens,"Azizi, H; Abdellatif, W; Nasrullah, M; Ali, S; Ding, J; Khosa, F","Background Despite changes in the discourse around gender distributions within academic leadership, women continue to be under-represented in academia. Our study aims to identify the extent of gender disparity in the academic leadership in the top 50 North American universities and to critically analyse the contributing factors through a comprehensive theoretical framework. Methods We adopted the theoretical framework of leadership continuum model. A retrospective analysis of the gender of the leadership ranks was conducted between December 2018 and March 2019 for the top 50 universities in North America (2019 Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking system). The leadership hierarchy was classified into six tiers. Results A total of 5806 faculty members from 45 US and five Canadian universities were included. Women were overall less likely to be in a senior leadership role than men (48.7% vs 51.3%; p value=0.05). Women accounted for fewer positions than men for resident/chancellor (23.8% vs 76.2%; p value<0.001), vice-president/vice-chancellor (36.3% vs 63.7%; p value<0.001), vice provost (42.7% vs 57.3%; p value=0.06), dean (38.5% vs 61.5%; p value<0.001) and associate dean (48.2% vs 51.8%; p-value=0.05). Women however were in a greater proportion in the assistant dean positions (63.8% vs 36.2%; p value<0.001).

"Cultivating Community College Pathways to STEM Leadership: Examining the Relationships Between Gender, Upward Transfer, and Students' Computing Leadership Identity","Blaney, JM","Objective: Upward transfer pathways are an important mechanism for advancing gender equity in STEM. Yet, little is known about how students access lucrative STEM careers and leadership positions via community colleges. This study explores the factors that may promote computing leadership identity among upward transfer students, focusing specifically on gender differences in upward transfer computing student experiences. Methods: This study relies on longitudinal survey data from N =1,955 computing majors across 15 universities in the United States. I used linear regression with tests of two- and three-way interaction terms to examine how factors associated with computing leadership identity might differ by upward transfer student status and gender. Results: Findings highlight how faculty mentorship, peer support, and involvement in student groups might shape leadership identity among all computing students. Other findings show that time spent working for pay is positively associated with leadership identity for non-transfers but negatively associated with leadership identity for upward transfer students. Significant three-way interactions show that parent career and sense of belonging in computing are uniquely associated with leadership identity for upward transfer women. Conclusions: This study identifies contextual factors that are uniquely associated with computing leadership identity for upward transfer students, while identifying ways in which institutions can increase upward transfer students' access to college experiences that are positively associated with leadership identity for all students.

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors in Empowerment of Women Towards Leadership: A Study in Higher Education (South Africa),"Moodly, A; Toni, N","Women's positions in society at large, have been within a context of cultures where patriarchy is the dominant culture and in which the glass ceiling is reached in attaining positions of leadership. The inequality in gender and leadership filters through all sectors of society, and manifests in the gendered cultures in which men are the voices of influence. Internationally, and nationally within South Africa, equity in representation of women in leadership has been acknowledged as part of transformation towards sustainable leadership. South Africa has focused in the past few decades post-democracy (1994), on gender inequality across sectors of society, and has focused on policy to address such inequities. The dearth of women in higher education (HE) leadership despite policy imperatives, as well as forming the majority in the field of HE, has put the focus quite sharply on inequities and professional support to address such inequalities. The scarcity has been attributed to a number of factors, including perceptions that there is a limited number of women applying for senior and leadership positions, insufficient support for professional effectiveness and career progression, and institutional cultures that favour men. Research also reflects that men tend to blame women themselves, saying that women do not apply to a sufficient degree. This paper focuses on an empirical study done in the South African higher education environment, to ascertain what motivates women towards taking up leadership positions. Factors, as identified through literature and qualitative empirical studies, formed part of the research instrument. A questionnaire was designed targeting women within South African Higher Education Institutions. Hypotheses were tested in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine women's access to leadership positions. The data was analysed according to descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings indicated that though extrinsic factors impact on women's access to leadership positions, intrinsic factors, inclusive of vision, aspiration towards leadership and research, impact positively. The results may have significance in that they indicate that though extrinsic factors impact on empowerment of women to leadership, intrinsic motivation may be more influential than considered, to women's empowerment and leadership career-pathing decisions.",2019,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GENDER RESEARCH (ICGR 2019),,,407-416,WOS:000471634700052,,,#528,Moodly 2019,"",""
"A comprehensive analysis of leadership attributes, discrepancies, and implications for gender equity in vascular surgery","Bellomo, TR; Reikersdorfer, K; Grobman, B; Lella, SK; Zacharias, N; Abai, B; Slaw, K; Garcia-Toca, M","Objective Well-developed leadership skills have been associated with a better understanding of health care context, increased team performance, and improved patient outcomes. Surgeons, in particular, stand to benefit from leadership development. Although studies have focused on investigating knowledge gaps and needs of surgeons in leadership roles, there is a noticeable gap in the literature concerning leadership in vascular surgery. The goal of this study was to characterize current leadership attributes of vascular surgeons and understand demographic influences on leadership patterns. Methods This retrospective cohort study was a descriptive analysis of vascular surgeons and their observers who took the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) from 2020 to 2023. The LPI is a 30-question inventory that measures the frequency of specific leadership behaviors across five practices of leadership. Results A total of 110 vascular surgeons completed the LPI. The majority of participants were White (56%) and identified as male (60%). Vascular surgeons most frequently observed the ""enabling others to act"" leadership practice style (8.90 +/- 0.74) by all evaluators. Vascular surgeons were most frequently above the 70th percentile in the ""challenge the process"" leadership practice style (49%) compared with the average of other leaders worldwide. Observers rated vascular surgeons as displaying significantly more frequent leadership behaviors than vascular surgeons rated themselves in every leadership practice style (P < .01). The only demographic variable associated with a significantly increased occurrence of achieving 70th percentile across all five leadership practice styles was the male gender: a multivariable model adjusting for objective experience showed that men were at least 3.5 times more likely to be rated above the 70th percentile than women. Conclusions Vascular surgeons under-report the frequency at which they practice leadership skills across all five leadership practice styles and should recognize their strengths of enabling others to act and challenging the process. Men are recognized as exhibiting all five leadership practices more frequently than women, regardless of current position or experience level.

The authors recruited resident participants from 5 specialties at 4 institutions; they randomly assigned residents to view one version of the video and rate the team leader's performance using the Ottawa Crisis Resource Management Global Rating Scale (Ottawa CRM) in an online survey. The authors conducted 2-way ANOVA to examine interactions between team leader gender and profession on Ottawa CRM ratings.ResultsOne hundred sixty residents responded (89 females, 71 males).

"Analysis of dual degree, gender, and specialty on obtaining leadership positions in academic settings: a multi-institutional study","Azzam, DB; Sharma, AN; Meller, LL; Noarbe, B; Chin, K; Torres, J; Sharma, SN; Wiechmann, W","Background: Disparities in advanced degrees, gender, and specialty for medical leadership in academia have not been described. Methods: In this cross-sectional multi-institutional study, the authors used the University of California (UC) employee database and organization charts to compile the physicians and medical leaders at 6 academic centers. Chi-square testing was used to identify factors associated with leadership positions. Results: Among physicians in leadership 34.6% had dual degrees compared to 25.3% without leadership roles (P<0.001). The PhD, MPH, and MBA were the only degrees overrepresented in leadership. Female physicians were underrepresented in general compared to males (42.8% vs. 57.2%; P<0.001), and even more so in leadership roles (28.0% vs. 72.0%; P<0.001). While Internal Medicine (24.6%) was the most common specialty in leadership, the only specialties overrepresented in leadership were Psychiatry (P=0.003) and Neurosurgery (P=0.019). Conclusions: This study uniquely characterizes the distribution of advanced degrees, gender, and specialties in six academic institutions.

Physician Men Leaders in Emergency Medicine Bearing Witness to Gender-Based Discrimination,"Iyer, MS; Wilson, K; Draucker, C; Hobgood, C","IMPORTANCE Approximately 60% of women physicians in emergency medicine (EM) experience gender-based discrimination (GBD). Women physicians are also more likely to experience GBD than men physicians, particularly from patients, other physicians, or nursing staff.OBJECTIVE To describe the responses of men who are academic department chairs in EM to GBD directed toward a woman colleague.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study was a secondary data analysis drawn from interviews of men EM academic department chairs at 18 sites who participated in a qualitative descriptive study between April 2020 and February 2021 on their perceptions of the influence of gender and leadership in academic medicine. Narrative data related to GBD were extracted and coded using conventional content analysis. Codes were clustered into themes and subthemes and summarized. Data were analyzed from November to December 2021.EXPOSURE Semistructured interviews conducted via teleconferencing.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Qualitative findings identifying experiences witnessing or learning about incidents of GBD against women colleagues, the impact of these observations, and personal or leadership actions taken in response to their observations.RESULTS All 18 men participants (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [7.5] years; mean [SD] time as a department chair, 7.2 [5.1] years) discussed witnessing or learning about incidents of GBD against women colleagues. The participant narratives revealed 3 themes: emotional responses to GBD, actions they took to address GBD, and reasons for not taking action to address GBD. When witnessing GBD, participants felt anger, disbelief, guilt, and shame. To take action, they served as upstanders, confronted and reported discrimination, provided faculty development on GBD, or enforced ""zero-tolerance"" policies. At times they did not take action because they did not believe the GBD warranted a response, perceived a power differential or an unsupportive institutional culture, or sought self-preservation.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study of men physician leaders, we found all participants reported feeling troubled by GBD against women colleagues and, if possible, took action to address the discrimination. At times they did not take action because of unsupportive workplace cultures. These findings suggest that institutional culture change that supports the interventions of upstanders and does not tolerate GBD is needed.",2023,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,6,1,,WOS:000926702600004,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.49555,,#538,Iyer 2023,"",""

Gender imbalance amongst promotion and leadership in academic surgical programs in Canada: A cross-sectional Investigation,"Hunter, J; Crofts, H; Keehn, A; Schlagintweit, S; Luc, JGY; Lefaivre, KA","Background Women are underrepresented at higher levels of promotion or leadership despite the increasing number of women physicians. In surgery, this has been compounded by historical underrepresentation. With a nation-wide focus on the importance of diversity, our aim was to provide a current snapshot of gender representation in Canadian universities.Methods This cross-sectional online website review assessed the current faculty listings for 17 university-affiliated academic surgical training departments across Canada in the 2019/2020 academic year. Gender diversity of academic surgical faculty was assessed across surgical disciplines. Additionally, gender diversity in career advancement, as described by published leadership roles, promotion and faculty appointment, was analyzed.Results Women surgeons are underrepresented across Canadian surgical specialties (totals: 2,689 men versus 531 women). There are significant differences in the gender representation of surgeons between specialties and between universities, regardless of specialty. Women surgeons had a much lower likelihood of being at the highest levels of promotion (OR: 0.269, 95% CI: 0.179-0.405). Men surgeons were statistically more likely to hold academic leadership positions than women (p = 0.0002). Women surgeons had a much lower likelihood of being at the highest levels of leadership (OR: 0.372, 95% CI: 0.216-0.641).Discussion This study demonstrates that women surgeons are significantly underrepresented at the highest levels of academic promotion and leadership in Canada.

Verbally, female physicians primarily displayed a masculine/agentic communication style of assertiveness, control, confidence and rationality. Nonverbally, however, they expressed a feminine/communal communication style of emotional attention, interpersonal sensitivity, responsiveness, kindness and empathy. Moreover, the analysis delineated integrated multimodal constructive vs. inhibitive communication strategies for crisis communication of female physicians in senior management positions.Research limitations/implicationsIn the current research the authors did not compare females to males in health management positions, which is their follow-up project, but the authors did examine studies of males and females in management positions in the political sphere, which supported their findings. Therefore, the authors were able to demonstrate theoretical implications of multimodal gendered communication frameworks of feminine leadership.Practical implicationsDelineating verbal and nonverbal gendered communicative structures of effective management in health sectors can help female physicians assume positions of leadership, serve as guide models for other female physicians and contribute to improving effective communication skills during a crisis.Social implicationsThis study contributes to the attempts of promoting gender equity in medicine and management by presenting effective communication strategies in medical crises that can help to promote female physicians' messages development, social influence, leadership and management success in the future.Originality/valueThis article presents constructive, multimodal gendered communication frameworks of female physicians in senior management positions used in television appearances during the global COVID-19 crisis.

Leadership Pathways in Academic Family Medicine: Focus on Underrepresented Minorities and Women,"Coe, CL; Piggott, C; Davis, A; Hall, MN; Goodell, K; Joo, P; South-Paul, JE","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Leadership positions in academic medicine lack racial and gender diversity. In 2016, the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM) established a Leadership Development Task Force to specifically address the lack of diversity among leadership in academic family medicine, particularly for underrepresented minorities and women.APPROACH: The task force was formed in August 2016 with members from each of the CAFM organizations representing diversity of race, gender, and academic position. The group met from August 2016 to December 2017. The task force reviewed available leadership development programming, and through consensus identified common pathways toward key leadership positions in academic family medicine-department chairs, program directors, medical student education directors, and research directors.CONSENSUS DEVELOPMENT: The task force developed a model that describes possible pathways to several leadership positions within academic family medicine. Additionally, we identified the intentional use of a multidimensional mentoring team as critically important for successfully navigating the path to leadership.CONCLUSIONS: There are ample opportunities available for leadership development both within family medicine organizations and outside. That said, individuals may require assistance in identifying and accessing appropriate opportunities. The path to leadership is not linear and leaders will likely hold more than one position in each of the domains of family medicine. Development as a leader is greatly enhanced by forming a multidimensional team of mentors.",2020,,FAMILY MEDICINE,52,2,104-111,WOS:000512988900004,10.22454/FamMed.2020.545847,,#561,Coe 2020,"",""
The motivational needs of primary health care nurses to acquire power as leaders in a mine clinic setting,"Jooste, K; Hamani, M","Motivation is a process that influences and directs behaviour in order to satisfy a need. It links with goal 3 of the sustainable development goals that focus on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages. Motivation of nurses is important in the primary health care environment of, for instance, mine settings; since low levels of motivation among Primary Health Care (PHC) nurses could have a negative effect on the achievement of high standards in health service delivery. The study was conducted within the theoretical framework of McClelland's Acquired Motivation Theory which consists of three basic needs, - the need for achievement, the need for power, and the need for affiliation. One of the research questions posed was ""What are the motivational needs of PHC nurses to acquire power in the workplace at mine clinic settings?"" A quantitative, explorative, descriptive design was followed. The accessible population in this study was PHC nurses (N = 30) working at 13 mine clinics, that also served as the total sample. A 7 point Likert scale was used in a self-administered structured questionnaire that was developed from a literature review. Ethical considerations were adhered to and respondents gave written informed consent. Data was analysed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The Mann Whitney test compared the mean ranks and a p-value of p<0.05 was indicative of a significant difference between male and female groups. Validity and reliability principles were applied during the entire research process. The results indicated that PHC nurses needed acknowledgement, organisational responsibility, strategic planning and promotion, as well as support. Significant differences between gender were not found in relation to the need to acquire power. Copyright (C) 2016, The Authors.

Gender Distribution in Academic Leadership: An Exploratory Study of Top Universities of Bangladesh,"IEEE; Towni, SN; Arisha, A; Rahman, NN; Rasul, II; Hossain, M; Iftekhar, L","Underrepresentation of women in numerous fields, including academia, especially in the engineering and technology domain have been studied from various perspectives. Bangladesh has had its fair share of studies resulting in efforts, policies and strategies to establish gender equality. Yet, despite the increasing presence of women in the Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering (STEM) fields and beyond, a conspicuous dearth of women can be observed at the top level of leadership in academia. In this paper, we look at publicly available data on academic leaders ( vice- chancellors, deans, academic heads, etc.) and faculty member designation distributions of the top 10 universities of the country according to a recent ranking. To fully understand the academic leadership scenario in engineering and affiliated fields, we must observe the entire faculty distribution in academia in general. We explore the presence of women in two tiers of leadership, Tier 1 and Tier 2 leadership, and find an alarming but predictable scenario of non-mentionable presence of women at the top administrative podium, despite their presence as faculty members. We note the ubiquity of this `vanishing tip' at 60% of these top universities which are often considered the role models for the other hundred plus institutions in the country.

Clinical trials play a very important role in shaping medical practice; moreover, the leaders of clinical trials often represent the upper echelon of researchers in any designated field. Presently, there is no data regarding women's representation in urological oncology clinical trials leadership. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the extent of female representation in leading urological clinical trials. Methodology To thoroughly examine the representation of females as principal investigators (PIs) in urological cancer clinical trials between 2000 and 2020, we conducted a comprehensive search of completed trials focused on kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer on ClinicalTrials.gov. We extracted relevant information regarding the PIs and analyzed the data using univariate analyses to identify any significant differences between male and female PIs. Results A total of 9145 cancer clinical trials were conducted over the last 2 decades, and 11.3% (n = 1033) of them were urological cancer clinical trials. We were able to obtain detailed information about the principal investigators (PI) in 79.0% (n = 816) of the clinical trials, and we found that 16.8% (n = 137) of them were led by female investigators. Upon evaluating the characteristics of the PIs, female PIs had a significantly lower median age and median total citations as compared to male PIs (55.0 vs 59.0 and 5333 vs 7902; p-value < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the termination rate, publication rate, funding source, cancer type, and the subject of conducting the clinical trials between male and female PIs. Conclusion Between 2000 and 2020, only 16.8% of urological cancer clinical trials were led by a female PI, perhaps reflective of a low percentage of senior female researchers in the fields of urology, oncology and radiation oncology.

Shifting the Paradigm Cultivating Socially Responsible Atmospheric Scientists through Leadership and Action,"Burt, MA; Fischer, E; Rasmussen, KL; Beem, KC","The geosciences have the lowest racial and ethnic diversity of all STEM fields at all levels of higher education, and atmospheric science is emblematic of this discrepancy. Despite a growing awareness of the problem, Black, Indigenous, people of color, persons with disabilities, women, and LGBTQIA+ persons continue to be largely absent in academic programs and in the geoscience workforce. There is a desire and need for new approaches, new entry points, and higher levels of engagement to foster a diverse community of researchers, scholars, and practitioners in atmospheric science. One challenge among many is that diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are often siloed from many aspects of the scientific process, technical training, and scientific community. We have worked toward bridging this gap through the development of a new atmospheric science course designed to break down traditional barriers for entry into diversity, equity, and inclusion engagement by graduate students, so they emerge better prepared to address issues of participation, representation, and inclusion.

The admissions of Scientella student leaders to STEM majors in selective US colleges indicates the promise of Scientella's approach, and that providing students with opportunities to engage in STEM-themed career exploration and leadership development could be an effective strategy to increase female STEM participation in post-secondary education and the pursuit of subsequent career opportunities.",2024,,EDUCATION SCIENCES,14,9,,WOS:001323199500001,10.3390/educsci14090955,,#570,Ford 2024,"",""
Women in Leadership and Their Influence on the Gender Diversity of Academic Plastic Surgery Programs,"Keane, AM; Larson, EL; Santosa, KB; Vannucci, B; Waljee, JF; Tenenbaum, MM; Mackinnon, SE; Snyder-Warwick, AK","Background:Women seldom reach the highest leadership positions in academic plastic surgery. Contributing factors include lack of female role models/mentors and lack of gender diversity. Studies show that female role models and mentors are critical for recruiting and retaining female surgeons and that gender diversity within organizations more strongly influences women's career choices. The authors therefore sought to determine the current gender diversity of academic plastic surgery programs and investigate influences of gender and leadership on program gender composition.Methods:A cross-sectional study of U.S. plastic surgery residency programs was performed in December of 2018. Genders of the leadership were collected, including medical school dean, department of surgery chair, department/division of plastic surgery chair/chief, plastic surgery program director, plastic surgery faculty, and plastic surgery residents.

Methods are outlined in a published protocol registered a priori on PROSPERO (CRD42020162115). Eligible studies reported on organisational interventions for advancing women in leadership with at least one measurable outcome. Studies were assessed independently by two reviewers. Identified interventions were organised into categories and meta-synthesis was completed following the 'ENhancing Transparency in REporting the synthesis of Qualitative research' (ENTREQ) statement.Findings: There were 91 eligible studies from 6 continents with 40 quantitative, 38 qualitative and 13 mixed methods studies. These spanned academia, health, government, sports, hospitality, finance and information technology sectors, with around half of studies in health and academia. Sample size, career stage and outcomes ranged broadly. Potentially effective interventions consistently reported that organisational leadership, commitment and accountability were key drivers of organisational change. Organisational intervention categories included i) organisational processes; ii) awareness and engagement; iii) mentoring and networking; iv) leadership development; and v) support tools. A descriptive meta-synthesis of detailed strategies, policies and practices within these categories was completed.Interpretation: This review provides an evidence base on organisational interventions for advancing women in leadership across diverse settings, with lessons for healthcare. It transcends the focus on the individual to target organisational change, capturing measurable change across intervention categories. This work directly informs a national initiative with international links, to enable women to achieve their career goals in healthcare and moves beyond the focus on barriers to solutions.

"Jobs, Collaborations, and Women Leaders of the Global Chemistry Enterprise: An Overview","Cheng, HN; Miller, B; Wu, ML","The global chemistry enterprise continues to be active and contributes substantially to the gross domestic products and employment in many countries. This article provides an overview of the issues of jobs, collaborations, and women leaders of the global chemistry enterprise. The availability of jobs is a significant contributor to the attractiveness of chemistry and chemical engineering as a career and ongoing job satisfaction of professionals working in this area. Included in this article are the issue of supply and demand of chemistry jobs, women as professors and professionals, and increased access to international career opportunities offered by ACS International Activities. Collaboration has always been known to be an effective method to stimulate and accelerate innovation. With increasing globalization, international collaboration is becoming increasingly important. A large number of successful international collaborations are provided in the chapters in this book and summarized in this article. The chemistry profession has often been difficult for women because of various forms of bias and competing priorities of family and career. Yet, a number of women scientists over the years have overcome difficulties and achieved notable success in scientific scholarship and/or professional leadership. Examples of successful women scientists, engineers, and leaders are cited in this article and described in detail in this book. All the information has been taken from the lectures given in two international symposia at the ACS national meeting in San Francisco in August 2014.",2015,,"JOBS, COLLABORATIONS, AND WOMEN LEADERS IN THE GLOBAL CHEMISTRY ENTERPRISE",1195,,1-12,WOS:000365246700001,,,#590,Cheng 2015,"",""
Women in leadership positions in universities: are they really queen bees?,"Grangeiro, RD; Neto, MBG; Esnard, C","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the adherence to the traits of the queen bee phenomenon (QBP) for women who hold leadership positions in Brazilian higher education institutions (HEIs) and to compare their responses with those of women without leadership positions and of men on the same dimensions. Design/methodology/approach A total of 703 academics from 88 HEIs participated in this study. The data were analyzed using a statistical package to calculate descriptive and inferential statistics. For these, 2 x 2 analysis of variance tests were performed to compare leader women vs nonleader women and leader women vs leader men. Findings The results indicate that leader women do not fit to all dimensions of the QBP. They report high averages to commitment, agency traits and personal sacrifices to career (Male self-description) and to meritocratic discourse. However, leader women assess their junior counterparts with higher averages to commitment and agency traits than women without leadership positions and leader men assess their junior counterparts. Women in leadership positions report superior identification with same gender colleagues and declare to be more supportive with affirmative policies for women's professional development than nonleader women and leader men. Practical implications This study reinforces that same gender conflict in the work environment is not a female characteristic and also promotes reflections on the influence of organizational culture, men hostility toward quotas and gender stereotypes for female progression in the academic context. Originality/value This study provides an empirical analysis of the QBP to academic women in Brazilian HEIs and compares its dimensions to nonleader women and leader men.

Gender representation among speaking and leader roles at European cardio-thoracic surgical annual meetings,"Galeone, A; Bernabei, A; Cleuziou, J; Menezes, V; Park, S; Kluin, J; Pompili, C","OBJECTIVES Our goal was to evaluate gender representation among session leaders and abstract presenters at European cardio-thoracic surgical annual meetings. METHODS We did a descriptive study of the gender distribution among session leaders and abstract presenters at 2 European cardio-thoracic international meetings from 2017 to 2022. Data from publicly available programmes were used to generate a list of session leaders and abstract presenters. The primary outcome was to evaluate the proportion of female sessions leaders at the annual meetings. Descriptive analyses were performed including the Cochran-Armitage trend test for linear trend of proportions. RESULTS A total of 1025 sessions of 11 annual meetings of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons were examined. A total of 397 (13.2%) out of 3007 total session leaders and 955 (15.2%) out of 6251 abstract presenters were female. From 2017 to 2022, the proportions of both female session leaders and abstract presenters trended significantly [10.4% to 21.9% (P < 0.001) and 13.7% to 18.3% (P < 0.001), respectively]. The EACTS female members and female meeting attendees significantly increased from 2017 to 2022 [11.1% to 15.9% (P < 0.001) and 23.7% to 26.9% (P < 0.001)], respectively. Most of the women attendees at the EACTS and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons meetings who were session leaders and speakers came from Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. CONCLUSIONS Women are under-represented compared to men in leadership and speaking roles at European cardio-thoracic surgical annual meetings. In the past few years, an encouraging positive trend over time for female leadership roles has been noted; as a result, the proportion of female society members is represented at the annual meetings. However, a substantial gender gap still exists in leading roles of meeting attendees",2024,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY,65,3,,WOS:001181694800005,10.1093/ejcts/ezad427,,#596,Galeone 2024,"",""
Educating Young Women to be Global Leaders: A Model,"Martin, SM; Jahani, S; Rosenblatt, K","The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates that over 40 million girls worldwide are not being given the same opportunity to attend primary schools as boys. The World Academy for the Future of Women (WAFW) leadership preparation program for young women is working to change that statistic and many others regarding the inclusion of women in global society. A survey was conducted to ascertain the knowledge, perceptions, and opinions of the participants who are university students from various schools of study at the university who demonstrate leadership qualities and the facilitators who deliver the leadership content, concerning the WAFW. A key component of the Academy is the eight modules of study which seeks to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (UNMDG). The intent of our study was to gather initial data on the value of the Academy. The majority (93 % of respondents) of the responses indicate knowledge of the vision, mission, and goals of the WAFW. The responses overall indicate value in continuing the WAFW; 93 % of the respondents knew and believed in the oath they had taken; after completing the modules, almost 88 % of the young women believed that they had inner strength would allow them to be global leaders and that WAFW was critical to being successful women. Similarly, 88 % of the WAFW members understood how to utilize the problem solving skills they learned to generate new strategies and approaches to solve global problems. We believe this research to be significant as it is supported by World Bank research (2016) that says ""Empowering women and girls is not only the right thing to do: It's also smart economics and vital to ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity""-women cannot be empowered if they lack the opportunity for education and leadership knowledge and skills.

"Women's leadership in academic medicine: a systematic review of extent, condition and interventions","Alwazzan, L; Al-Angari, SS","ObjectivesBecause culture reflects leadership, the making of diverse and inclusive medical schools begins with diversity among leaders. The inclusion of women leaders remains elusive, warranting a systematic exploration of scholarship in this area. We ask: (1) What is the extent of women's leadership in academic medicine? (2) What factors influence women's leadership? (3) What is the impact of leadership development programmes?DesignSystematic review.Data sourcesA systematic search of six online databases (OvidMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and ERIC) from the earliest date available to April 2018 was conducted.

Educational Leadership: A Fifteen Year Bibliometric Review,"Maheshwari, G; Ramsawak, R; Buertey, S","Exploring educational leadership is crucial for shaping the future of higher education, influencing students, educators, and institutional dynamics. This thorough review is conducted by analysing 36 research articles published in the Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice (JUTLP) from 2008 to 2022. The study underscores the urgent need for a nuanced understanding of diverse leadership practices within the ever-changing educational landscape. While the majority of studies in JUTLP focused on women's leadership, it became evident that other aspects of educational leadership are yet to be explored in the journal's domain. The analysis also highlights significant gaps in the existing literature, emphasising the necessity for more comprehensive studies that encompass broader societal contexts and global perspectives. The prevalence of qualitative methodologies in the analysed articles indicates a preference for profound qualitative insights into leadership dynamics within academia, particularly in this journal. Key findings pinpoint critical areas for future exploration. With the spotlight on women's leadership, the study identifies gaps in research published In JUTLP related to diversity in leadership roles, international comparative studies, crisis management strategies, and the effective integration of technology in education. A particularly notable gap revolves around understanding the impact of educational leadership on sessional staff, urging institutions to empower this essential segment of academia.

Mary PoppinsWas a Very Wise Woman: Insights for Effective Leadership in Academia,"ASEE; Terpenny, JP","While progress is modest, the number of women entering leadership positions in academia is rising. Many are watching to see just how women perform and whether they will remain in leadership positions. Several speculate, and rightly so, that to be effective leaders, women cannot completely emulate their male counterparts, but must recognize and utilize their unique perspectives, talents and skills. Women and men are different; surely leadership styles and methods will be varied.In this paper, analogies drawn from insights gleaned from the fictional character Mary Poppins are used to describe a variety of approaches and methods that have been developed and implemented for effective leadership in academia by the author, a woman who is an engineering department chair (head) and director of a large national industry/university cooperative research center. Following an introduction that includes background and motivation, a brief review of the literature on academic leadership and gender differences in leadership is presented. Three primary approaches are then described, including: 1) know your organization, 2) foster collaboration, a sense of team and community, and 3) serve as an example of excellence. Details of several methods and strategies are provided for implementing each of the three primary approaches. These range from specifics for effective meetings that foster engagement and collaboration, to methods that are less familiar in academic settings such as show-and-tell activities at departmental retreats and the use of brainstorming methods that are typically reserved for teaching engineering design that are used instead for problem solving and inclusion in faculty meetings. The dramatic improvements that have resulted are discussed throughout the approach and methods section and with conclusions and include metrics captured in key performance indicators (KPIs), required by the College of Engineering to measure and report organizational performance. For example, in the last 2 1/2 years, enrollments have nearly doubled (270 to 450), student retention rates are remarkable (95% for first year students and 90% at six years), research expenditures have doubled, and more. A discussion of antidotal observations associated with indicators of effective leadership such as collegiality and spirit of community is also included. Examples include indicators such as the majority of faculty and staff office doors being open, activity throughout the hallways of the department, visitors and students routinely remarking on the energy and collegiality they observe and can 'feel', and faculty, staff, and students routinely engaging in on-and off-campus activities and social events.",2014,,2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE,,,,WOS:000383779805047,,,#605,ASEE 2014,"",""
"Entrepreneurial self-efficacy among first-year undergraduates: Gender, creative self-efficacy, leadership self-efficacy, and field of study","Alvarez-Huerta, P; Muela, A; Larrea, I","Objective: To contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence university students' confidence in their ability to engage in entrepreneurial behaviours.Research Design & Methods: Participants were 1741 first-year students (792 women, 949 men) from two Spanish universities (Mage = 18.76, SD = 1.82). They were enrolled in degree programmes in two broad fields: engineering and architecture, and social sciences and law. Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, we obtained measures of creative self-efficacy, leadership self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy.Findings: Results showed that both leadership self-efficacy and creative self-efficacy predicted entrepreneurial self-efficacy, although creative self-efficacy was the variable that contributed most to the expected change in entrepreneurial self-efficacy. There were also differences in entrepreneurial self-efficacy according to gender and field of study, with students enrolled in a technical field and men in general scoring higher. Mediation-moderation analysis showed that creative self-efficacy mediated the relationship between gender and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and also that the field of study buffered the effect of gender on entrepreneurial self-efficacy.Implications & Recommendations: The results of this study showed that entrepreneurial self-efficacy is predicted by creative self-efficacy and leadership self-efficacy, and hence both these variables should be addressed by training initiatives aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among undergraduates, particularly among young women. Moreover, our results highlighted the importance of taking into consideration individuals' educational backgrounds when analysing students' entrepreneurial self-efficacy.Contribution & Value Added: This research contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship by identifying factors that influence the entrepreneurial self-efficacy of university students. The findings highlight the importance of considering creative self-efficacy when analysing students' entrepreneurial development. Furthermore, we show that creative self-efficacy has a mediating effect on the association between gender and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and also that this relationship is moderated by students' fields of study. Overall, these results suggest that reinforcing the creative self-efficacy of women could help to close the gender gap in entrepreneurial self-efficacy. It might also be useful to design specific training initiatives for undergraduates enrolled in social sciences, the aim of which would be to foster an entrepreneurial culture and encourage them to recognize their potential role as entrepreneurs.",2022,,ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW,10,4,73-89,WOS:001015964300004,10.15678/EBER.2022.100405,,#606,Alvarez-Huerta 2022,"",""
Evaluation of two longitudinal faculty leadership training programs: behavioral change and institutional impact,"Mayowski, CA; Norman, MK; Proulx, CN; Hamm, ME; Martin, MK; Zellers, DF; Rubio, DM; Levine, AS","Purpose Building leadership skills among faculty in academic medicine is essential, yet professional development programs focused on leadership are not always attentive to the needs of faculty on diverse career pathways or at differing career stages-nor are they often rigorously assessed.

Physicians' leadership styles in rural primary medical care: How are they perceived by staff?,"Hana, J; Kirkhaug, R","Aim. This study investigates which leadership styles can be identified among general practice lead physicians and how they are associated with and predicted by staff and context characteristics like profession, gender, age, work experience, and team size. Method/material. In a cross-sectional study self-administered questionnaires were distributed to staff physicians (42% females) and support staff (98% females) at 101 primary health care centres in North Norway. A total of 127 and 222, respectively, responded (response rate 59%). Items were ranked on Likert scales (range 1-5). Results. Analysis revealed three significantly different styles (mean scores/Cronbach's alpha): change style (3.36/0.898), task style (3.17/0.885), and relation style (2.88/0.900). The lead physicians were perceived as practising change style the most and relation style the least. Males experienced significantly more of all three styles. Support staff scored lowest for all styles. Age was negatively correlated with relation style and change style, while work experience was negatively correlated with change style. No significant association was found between styles and team size. Conclusion. Leadership in rural general practice can be identified in terms of task, relation, and change styles. Change style is the most perceived style. Males seem to be most attentive to leadership styles. However, within the staff physician group, there is less difference between genders. Support staff scores lowest for all styles; this might indicate either less need for leadership or dissatisfaction with leadership. Age and work experience seem to reduce employees' attention to relation and change styles, indicating that maturity reduces needs for these leadership styles. Due to growing demands for leaders to take care of efficiency and change in general practice, more young female physicians, and more diverse staff groups, these findings may be useful to understand leadership and leadership training for general practice.",2014,,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE,32,1,4-10,WOS:000333047800002,10.3109/02813432.2013.874083,,#610,Hana 2014,"",""
'Every One of You Is a Leader': Investigating the Experience of Being a Brown British Muslim Woman in Professional Contexts,"Zaidi, S","The Hadith paraphrased as 'every one of you is a leader' does not discriminate in gender in any way-both men and women are leaders. What does this mean in practice, and how are Muslim women perceived and received in line with this Hadith?

In this article, I explore how different 'contextual intersectionalities' influence and impact a Muslim woman and her leadership role. How does the intersectionality of her outward expression of faith identify her? How does a Muslim woman navigate a space where she is the leader and her skills are sought, yet her faith representation may instigate unconscious/conscious biases? Using an autoethnographic method, I investigate the impact of my identities as a Brown British Muslim woman in three distinct settings. First, in the professional and academic space of British Christian practical theology, where I was the first British Muslim to obtain a doctorate in the subject and was the first Muslim Trustee and Committee Member of the British and Irish Association for Practical Theology (BIAPT) between 2020 and 2024. Second, as a leadership advisor and executive coach to FTSE-listed companies, where I support C-suite leaders to generate sustained change in individuals, teams, and systems. And third, as a tutor and supervisor of proven business leaders to master the skills of coaching in their own right. I discuss how I am met in these spaces and the impact of that on my being.

Of specific interest in the study were how they described the level of advocacy of department chair in their success and career progression, and how they described the knowledge and actions of their department chair relative to establishing and maintaining a collegial and equitable working environment. The study was framed by a conceptual framework that supports the role of the department chair responsibilities in faculty success. The study settings were two public, large, highest research-intensive universities located in the southern United States. Participants were 20 women STEM faculty. The findings indicated that many of the participants perceived that their department chair lacked sufficient training to advocate for them, did not always understand the differences in experiences between women and men faculty in STEM, nor their role and responsibility for ensuring collegial and equitable working environment. Some participants identified that their department chairs were committed to the work of equity and ensured department collegiality.",2024,,JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,30,6,,WOS:001267943100002,,,#618,Jones 2024,"",""
MIND THE GAP OF LEADERSHIP: THE GENDER MENTORING PROGRAM OF THE BUILDING ENGINEERING SCHOOL,"Merino, MD; Sáez, PV; Jiménez, RS","In order to enhance women's leadership, a Gender Mentoring Program (GMP) was implemented at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Edificacion (ETSEM) from the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), during the academic year 2014-2015. This paper evaluates the GMP experience highlighting the advantages and barriers found during its implementation and giving remedial actions for the following years. The analysis carried out was mainly performed using the questionnaires answered in the sessions and the satisfaction surveys completed by all participants regarding different aspects of the GMP. Results show a high dropout rate as only 50% of the mentees completed the GMP and attended to all the sessions. 100% of them considered that the support given by the mentors was the most valued item of the Program. Moreover, 36% of mentees were very satisfied with the knowledge and the leadership experience gained, and 41% would recommend participating in the GMP. In general, the overall assessment of the Mentoring is very positive since 100% of respondents rated it above 4 (out of 5).

DONE WELL OR NOT DONE AT ALL: INCREASING MINORITY WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION IN LEADERSHIP,"Johnson, BE; Howard-Baptiste, SD","In order for students of any age to compete in a globalized, ever-changing society, it is imperative that those in leadership roles reflect the needs of the communities they serve. Part of service in any capacity requires critical self-reflection and consistent assessment of ""who is missing from the table,"" in addition to conversation toward progress, social justice, and the transformation of antiquated ideologies and ways of knowing. As members of minority and historically marginalized groups reflect the majority of global citizens (Colby, S. L., & Ortman, J. M. (2015). Projections of the size and composition of the U.

Communication essentials for female executives to develop leadership presence: Getting beyond the barriers of understating accomplishment,"Grant, AD; Taylor, A","Statistics about women's presence as CEOs, directors, and board members show relative stagnation over the last few years. Many theories exist to explain this problem, but there is a paucity of specific suggestions targeted at individuals seeking to rise to the top of their organizations. In this article we propose that changing the way women talk about accomplishments can improve leadership presence and aid in promotion. We analyzed video interviews of 20 men and 20 women in leadership roles at Fortune 50 companies. Since leaders will inevitably confront this when interviewing for promotions, we chose to focus on the question: ""In your career, what are the accomplishments you are most proud of?"" We analyzed content, syntax, gestures, and facial expressions, and identified significant differences in the way men and women talked about accomplishment. Based upon our research, we identify six communication essentials that can help women project confidence: (1) starting strong, (2) staying succinct, (3) dimensionalizing content, (4) owning voice, (5) controlling movement, and (6) projecting warmth.

"Role of mentorship, career conceptualization, and leadership in developing women's physics identity and belonging","Rosenberg, JL; Holincheck, N; Fernández, K; Dreyfus, BW; Wardere, F; Stehle, S; Butler, TN","The percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees in physics (25%) in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from 2 institutions: a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, consistent with the existing literature, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people. While the data on how career conceptualization contributed to the building of identity is limited, there are some connections to recognition and competence, and it will be an interesting avenue of future exploration.",2024,,PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,20,1,,WOS:001187566500001,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.010114,,#629,Rosenberg 2024,"",""
Library Staff are More Motivated to Engage in Professional Development When Encouraged by Library Leadership,"Bussell, H","Objective - This study explores whether there is a correlation between academic library leaders' support for professional development and their employees' professional self-esteem and motivation to participate in professional development.Design - Survey questionnaire.Setting - Academic libraries in Norway.Subjects - 1,637 full time equivalent (FTE) staff.Methods - The theoretical framework for this study is knowledge management. The author defines this as ""The creation and subsequent management of an environment which encourages knowledge to be created, shared, learnt, enhanced, and organized for the benefit of the organization and its customers"" (Sarrafzadeh, Martin, & Hazeri, 2006, p. 624, quoted on p. 3). An anonymous quantitative survey was made available to staff working in Norwegian academic libraries. The survey included questions about to what extent their leader encourages them to attend conferences, to what extent their leader understands their skills and competencies, personal belief in their own skills and competencies to perform their work tasks, and number of professional development activities they attended in 2015 (including conferences, continuing education seminars, and interdepartmental seminars).Main Results - 626 survey responses were collected, for a 38% response rate. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Over 50% of all survey respondents reported high satisfaction with their professional skills and competencies. There is a difference when broken down by gender, with 77% of men reporting confidence in their professional skills versus 63% of women. Education level, on the other hand, does not make a difference. The study found a correlation between perception by library staff that their library leader has a ""good overview"" of their professional skills and staff members' confidence in their ability to perform their job well. Library staff with leaders who encouraged professional development were more likely to participate in external professional development activities. Participation in internal professional development activities was not affected by library leaders' encouragement.Conclusion - When library staff are encouraged by library leadership to participate in professional development, they are more likely to do so. Library staff who perceive that their library's leaders recognize and value their professional skills and competencies have a higher sense of professional self-esteem. Library leaders can use knowledge management to come to a better understanding of the knowledge and skills their staff members already possess, and to encourage communities of practice and the sharing of knowledge in the organization.

Findings/Conclusions: Thirty-eight percent of schools did not address feminine hygiene and menstruation in pretrip communications. Predominant themes consisted of an emphasis on health and hygiene, dependence on female leaders, a need for more knowledge and resources, and a desire for normalization.

"Effects of a First-Year Undergraduate Engineering Design Course: Survey Study of Implications for Student Self-Efficacy and Professional Skills, with Focus on Gender/Sex and Race/Ethnicity","Sperling, Jessica; Menna Mburi; Gray, Megan; Schmid, Lorrie; Saterbak, Ann","Background: Students' academic self-efficacy maximizes likelihood for success and retention, yet prior research suggests that historically underrepresented (minoritized) undergraduate students in higher education and in college-level engineering show lower self-efficacy, which has been linked to histories of systemic exclusion. To address such gaps in student success, this work examines the effect of a new first-year undergraduate engineering design course on students' self-efficacy, as measured by students' assessment of their ability to achieve engineering design goals, and their confidence in their professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. It draws upon two aligned survey studies that examine this development: (1) among the students participating in the course during the academic semester; and (2) among both course participants and non-participants in the year following the course. Survey results for all students were considered, with attention to specific demographic subgroups traditionally underrepresented in engineering. Results: Analyses indicate effect of the course on self-efficacy and other examined constructs, such as communication and teamwork, during the course semester and continued effects in engineering design self-efficacy and tinkering self-efficacy in the year following course participation. Results also reveal differences for specific racial/ethnic and gender/sex subgroups in numerous constructs, including suggestion of specific effect for female students. Conclusions: This study's focus on the implication of engineering design education on self-efficacy and other critical professional outcomes, as well as its attention to specific demographic subgroups, adds to research on engineering education and the effect of design-focused coursework using project-based learning. The study indicates an increased potential role for such coursework, as early as the first year of a university trajectory, in fostering student growth and increased representation in the field. Findings on differences by gender/sex and by racial/ethnic groups, including clearer positive effect for female students but more complexity in effect for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, support added research probing experience and outcomes within and across these groups.",2024,,International Journal of STEM Education,11,,,3040236735; EJ1410343,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-024-00467-6,,#639,Sperling 2024,"",""
How Universities Gaslight EDI&I Initiatives: Mapping Institutional Resistance to Structural Change,"MacKenzie, Megan; Sensoy, Özlem; Johnson, Genevieve Fuji; Sinclair, Nathalie; Weldon, Laurel","Despite the visibility of equity, diversity, inclusion, and Indigenization (EDI&I) discourses within large institutions, such as post-secondary institutions, research has chronicled only modest advancements on these stated values.

Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The study was shaped by the following questions: (1) How is ""successful"" support of a transgender child defined by the educators who worked with a child as her gender identity and expression changed? (2) What were the educators' strategies for facilitating the student's in-school transition? (3) What (if any) actions were taken to recognize or affirm gender diversity? This article focuses on one educator advocate's experiences navigating a district administrator's expressions of discomfort with transgender inclusion, which he deployed in situations in which he believed proposals for gender-inclusive policies and practices were ""running wild"" and too far from the institutional status quo. Participants: Interview participants were school personnel, including administrators, teachers, and counselors, who worked in the school while the child was in kindergarten through third grade, and the student's mother.

An Analysis of the Technology Leadership Behaviours of School Principals from the Perspective of Teachers,"Turan, Selçuk; Gökbulut, Bayram","This study aimed to examine the technology leadership behaviours of school principals based on the perceptions of teachers, by employing a mixed method design in which quantitative and qualitative methods were used concurrently. It was conducted with teachers working in public schools in a province in the West Black Sea Region, Turkey. The quantitative data were obtained from 198 teachers using the Technology Leadership Scale, while the qualitative data were collected from 24 teachers through open-ended questions containing the sub-dimensions of the Technology Leadership Scale. The quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, and ANOVA test, while the qualitative data analysis was conducted through the descriptive analysis approach using MaxQDA 2020 software. The results revealed that the teachers participating in the study consider their school principals' levels of technology-related leadership behaviour as sufficient. No statistically significant difference was observed between the technology leadership behaviours, and the variables of the teachers' gender, educational background, and professional seniority. Statistical significance was found between the teachers' perceptions regarding the school principals' technology leadership levels and the variable of teachers' length of work in the same school. The teachers with shorter length of work in the same school regard the technology leadership levels of school principals higher than those with longer length of work.

Preparing Industry Leaders: The Role of Doctoral Education and Early Career Management Training in the Leadership Trajectories of Women STEM PhDs,"Main, Joyce B.; Wang, Yanbing; Tan, Li","While gender diversity in leadership has been shown to benefit organizations and promote innovations, women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions in the industry sector. With increasing numbers of women pursuing PhDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, it is critical to examine how PhD programs contribute to the career paths of PhDs. This study examines the role of doctoral education preparation in communication, management, and technical skills, as well as post-PhD early career management training (ECMT), on PhDs' attainment of leadership positions in industry. Data come from the National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates, and National Research Council Rankings of PhD programs. Using regression analyses, results indicate that ECMT is associated with a higher likelihood of attainment of leadership positions. PhD preparation in management skills also contributes to the attainment of leadership positions. Previous literature has shown that structural inequities and workplace bias contribute to limiting women's progress to leadership positions and that it is critical to address systemic and workplace biases. Research findings suggest that PhD program preparation and increased access to professional development opportunities can help contribute to the enhancement of women's pathways to leadership roles. Structural changes in doctoral education preparation in management skills and increases in ECMT opportunities offered by employers also have the potential to increase the participation of STEM PhDs in leadership roles in industry.",2022,,Research in Higher Education,63,3,400-424,2661234390; EJ1332884,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11162-021-09655-7,,#656,Main 2022,"",""

To determine what sort of barriers and assistance female STEM leaders have encountered, a survey was developed asking women who are in academic leadership positions in STEM about their experiences. The main barriers were similar in the STEM area and in leadership: balancing work/home life, devaluing of achievements, and imposter syndrome. The main two types of assistance in both STEM and leadership were support from spouse/partner, and encouragement from peers. The main barriers women encounter are cultural and will take time to overcome. The main assistance women have had comes from people, not training or institutional structures.",2020,,Education Sciences,10,,,2488223731; EJ1272706,,,#679,McCullough 2020,"",""

The results of our serial and parallel mediation analysis confirmed the CCWAS dimensions, and further indicated that a positive NSE department/unit culture supports women's career satisfaction and may reduce their emotional exhaustion.

Developing a Feminist Identity among Elite Female Students in a Chinese University: A Qualitative Study,"Zheng, Jiaran","The aim of this study is to investigate the forms, significance and effects of feminist identity development among elite young women in a Chinese university environment. Based on fieldwork conducted over 11 months in a Chinese public university with a predominately male student body, this study explores the gendered experiences of eight female student leaders. It finds that there is a contradiction in the participants' identity construction process. On the one hand, these young Chinese women construct a collective identity which is both distant from an elite identity and conforms to several traditional or dominant discourses. On the other hand, they resort to individual efforts to realise their life aspirations rather than participating in collective feminist movements. Such ways of identity construction and the presence of such a significant contradiction can point to the new space and future direction for young women struggling to achieve gender equality in China. Drawing on psychological and sociological theories in feminist studies, this study suggests that participants are actively involving themselves in global feminisms to realise their individual dreams.

In this article we contribute new evidence on the magnitude of the wage premium, and address a puzzle found in previous studies: how to explain the direct pay premium whereby privately educated male workers have higher wages even than their similarly educated peers. It is commonly conjectured that the broader curriculum that private schools are able to deliver, coupled with the peer pressures of a partially segregated section of society, help to inculcate cultural capital, including some key ""non-cognitive"" attributes. We focus here on leadership, organisational participation and an acceptance of hard work. We find that privately educated workers are in jobs that require significantly greater leadership skills, offer greater organisational participation and require greater work intensity. These associations are partially mediated by educational achievement. Collectively these factors contribute little, however, to explaining the direct pay premium. Rather, a more promising account arises from the finding that inclusion of a variable for industry reduces the private school premium to an insignificant amount, which is consistent with selective sorting of privately educated workers into high-paying industries.",2017,,British Educational Research Journal,43,1,7-28,1895987137; EJ1128543,https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3256,,#698,Green 2017,"",""

Data were collected by the utilization of ""Family Leadership Orientation Scale, Social Entrepreneurship Scale, Generativity Scale and Grade Points of Average (GPA) of the students."" Data were analyzed by quantitative analysis techniques. The findings showed that college students were pretty under the influence of economic family leadership with 4.52 average score. Social entrepreneurship (3.71), generativity (3.61) and academic achievement (3.03) were evaluated by the students as good level. There were statistically significant differences in terms of gender and academic achievement for economic and social family leadership orientation. The results of regression analyses showed that the family leadership orientation explains 27% of social entrepreneurship; 16% of generativity and 5% of academic achievement. The family leadership perception, which constitutes three dimensions, namely social, cultural and economic, affects the students' social entrepreneurship and this consequently influences their generativity and academic achievement.

Diversity Exiting the Academy: Influential Factors for the Career Choice of Well-Represented and Underrepresented Minority Scientists,"Layton, Rebekah L.; Brandt, Patrick D.; Freeman, Ashalla M.; Harrell, Jessica R.; Hall, Joshua D.; Sinche, Melanie","A national sample of PhD-trained scientists completed training, accepted subsequent employment in academic and nonacademic positions, and were queried about their previous graduate training and current employment. Respondents indicated factors contributing to their employment decision (e.g., working conditions, salary, job security). The data indicate the relative importance of deciding factors influencing career choice, controlling for gender, initial interest in faculty careers, and number of postgraduate publications. Among both well-represented (WR; n = 3,444) and underrepresented minority (URM; n = 225) respondents, faculty career choice was positively associated with desire for autonomy and partner opportunity and negatively associated with desire for leadership opportunity. Differences between groups in reasons endorsed included: variety, prestige, salary, family influence, and faculty advisor influence. Furthermore, endorsement of faculty advisor or other mentor influence and family or peer influence were surprisingly rare across groups, suggesting that formal and informal support networks could provide a missed opportunity to provide support for trainees who want to stay in faculty career paths. Reasons requiring alteration of misperceptions (e.g., limited leadership opportunity for faculty) must be distinguished from reasons requiring removal of actual barriers. Further investigation into factors that affect PhDs' career decisions can help elucidate why URM candidates are disproportionately exiting the academy.",2016,,CBE - Life Sciences Education,15,3,1-9,1871583491; EJ1115159,https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.16-01-0066,,#705,Layton 2016,"",""

Perceived Online Education Barriers of Administrators and Faculty at a U.S. University in Lebanon,"El Turk, Sahar; Cherney, Isabelle D.","The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the perceived barriers obstructing the implementation of online education by administrators and faculty at the School of Arts and Sciences of a U.S. university located in Lebanon. The aim of this study was to offer a solution to the most important perceived barriers to online education that informs administrative decisions concerning the appropriate modalities of online instruction that may be implemented at the university. The exploratory factor analysis identified 8 factors out of 35 possible perceived barriers to online education. Faculty and administrators perceived the structural barriers and the pedagogical barriers as very important. Faculty also perceived technical barriers as very important. As a first step toward offering online instruction, the university leadership could offer blended traditional and online education instruction for suitable courses in the School of Arts and Sciences with the goal of assessing feasibility and acceptance. The implementation of this solution may be smoother if facilitated using various leadership styles.

"Gender, Religion, and Sociopolitical Issues in Cross-Cultural Online Education","Zaidi, Zareen; Verstegen, Daniëlle; Naqvi, Rahat; Morahan, Page; Dornan, Tim","Cross-cultural education is thought to develop critical consciousness of how unequal distributions of power and privilege affect people's health. Learners in different sociopolitical settings can join together in developing critical consciousness--awareness of power and privilege dynamics in society--by means of communication technology. The aim of this research was to define strengths and limitations of existing cross-cultural discussions in generating critical consciousness. The setting was the FAIMER international fellowship program for mid-career interdisciplinary health faculty, whose goal is to foster global advancement of health professions education. Fellows take part in participant-led, online, written, task-focused discussions on topics like professionalism, community health, and leadership. We reflexively identified text that brought sociopolitical topics into the online environment during the years 2011 and 2012 and used a discourse analysis toolset to make our content analysis relevant to critical consciousness. While references to participants' cultures and backgrounds were infrequent, narratives of political-, gender-, religion-, and other culture-related topics did emerge. When participants gave accounts of their experiences and exchanged cross-cultural stories, they were more likely to develop ad hoc networks to support one another in facing those issues than explore issues relating to the development of critical consciousness. We suggest that cross-cultural discussions need to be facilitated actively to transform learners' frames of reference, create critical consciousness, and develop cultural competence.

"Demographic Factors and Job Satisfaction: A Case of Teachers in Public Primary Schools in Bomet County, Kenya","Chirchir, Reuben","The success of any school depends among others on the social capital including teachers, students, parents and other stakeholders who support the business of imparting knowledge. Satisfied and committed teachers impact both on individual student performance and general academic standards of the school. The study explored job satisfaction among primary school teachers in relation to certain demographic variables. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the influence of demographic factors on job satisfaction of teachers in public primary schools in Bomet County, Kenya. This was done by conducting a survey using a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 848 teachers in 129 primary schools participated in the study. Descriptive and Inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. The overall finding was that teachers were ambivalent on job satisfaction, meaning that they were not sure whether they are satisfied with their jobs. However, teachers were satisfied with their colleague co-teachers and happy when assigned administrative duties. Teachers were more satisfied when authority was delegated to them. It is evident that school leadership needs to improve in ways of supervision, systems of reward, ways of communication, and working conditions. It was further established that there was significant differences in the level of satisfaction of male and female teachers for satisfaction with administrative duties (t = 2.645) and satisfaction with teaching (t = 2.448). It was also found that male teachers are more satisfied with administrative duties (m = 3.2; s.d. = 1.05) than female teachers (m = 2.91; s.d. = 1.18). Similarly, male teaches are more satisfied with teaching (m = 2.6; s.d. = 0.70) than female teachers (m = 2.5; s.d. = 0.79). This implies that female teachers are not keen on taking up additional administrative duties in the school. Overall, there was no significant difference between the levels of job satisfaction between male and female teachers. On the other hand, it was found that job satisfaction was positively correlated with the ""age of respondent"" (r = 0.092; p<0.01) and ""experience in teaching"" (r = 0.081; p<0.05).",2016,,Journal of Education and Practice,7,13,152-158,1826540596; EJ1102798,,,#713,Chirchir 2016,"",""

INCREASING FEMALE VISIBILITY IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS BY DISMANTLING MALE HEGEMONY IN ZIMBABWEAN STATE UNIVERSITIES,"Chitsamatanga, Bellita Banda","Using a sample of 21 purposively selected participants from 2 State Universities in Zimbabwe in Midlands and Masvingo provinces respectively. The study sought to establish if male hegemony alongside the consequences of contemporary discrimination enhanced lack of gender knowledge in the promotion of female academics to positions of leadership. A qualitative approach was used in line with the interpretivist paradigm. A case study design was adopted to support the data collection techniques. Qualitative data were inductively analysed and consisted of identifying, coding and categorizing patterns found in the data through face-to-face interviews and focus group interviews. Findings reveal that male hegemony and vestiges of contemporary discrimination are still present in universities and continue to subordinate female academics' critical mass to positions of leadership due to persistence of lack of gender knowledge and micro-politics. As part of educating the university community about gender knowledge, gender related programs, training and workshops had been carried out in collaboration with external and internal gender experts and activists. Results further illuminate that the promotion of gender knowledge and tackling male hegemonic tendencies and consequences of contemporary discrimination are not optional accessories but sine-quo-non for addressing the dearth of female leadership in universities. The study recommends that as a benchmark to promoting visibility of females in leadership positions gender policies be implemented by involving policy implementers and policy makers starting from the policy formulation process. Gender audits remain vital as they will provide a context to re-envision universities as spaces that are more inclusive and gender just. Formalized monitoring and evaluation should be carried out regularly using a monitoring and evaluation framework this will promote female visibility and a move towards gender equality. Additionally, universities should mainstream gender into their strategic plans towards promoting and sustaining gender equality and equity. As a way of addressing gender imbalances in decision making processes, gender awareness-raising and capacity-building programmes should be ongoing and regularly reviewed in order to determine their effectiveness in curbing ideals of male hegemony in university spaces.",2023,,Gender & Behaviour,21,3,21940-21951,3153911951,,,#734,Chitsamatanga 2023,"",""
The Role of Women Students’ Perception on Sports Leadership Career Aspiration in South African Universities: A Mediation-Moderation Model,"Gama, Nqobile P; Muofhe, John; Shepherd Dhliwayo; Chebo, Abdella K","Purpose:One of the most prominent realities of the sports industry across the world is the under-representation of women in leadership positions. The study investigated women students’ perception of sports leadership roles, media, and gender-based stereotypes towards sports leadership career aspirations (SLCA).Methodology:A quantitative research method was adopted and data was collected using a questionnaire from a convenient sample of 97 women sports students. Descriptive statistics, the ordinary least squares technique, and hierarchical regression analysis were employed for moderation roles while OLS regression analysis was used to examine the mediation role.Findings:The study reveals that the perception of women students of sports leaders and the role of the media improves their aspiration for a career as sports leaders. In addition, it shows that the women’s positive perception of sports leaders will indirectly boost their aspirations to become sports leaders since they feel that sports leadership is exciting and enjoyable. Women sports students perceive that the role played by media contributes to the extent of leadership positions occupied by women, which in turn influences the extent of women’s aspiration to the sports leadership career. Furthermore, the study indicates that as women’s academic qualifications are improved, their aspiration toward a sports leadership career is increased.Originality:The study focuses on the leadership aspirations of women sports students who are being groomed to address gender misrepresentation in leadership in general, and in sports leadership in particular. Studies and media coverage on women's sports and women's leadership are skewed towards men, and any study on the latter contributes to a desired equitable balance or at least increased woman participation.Implications:Strategies are suggested to develop and absorb women sports students who aim to become sports leaders in the future.

An intensive research plan was developed, and 1,120 outcomes were obtained. Finally, 35 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the study. A comprehensive and systematic approach is followed, with the goal of not just summarizing current empirical studies on the subject, but also including an aspect of analytical critique besides organizational policies.FindingsThe findings show that organizations with female chief executive officers (CEOs) are more likely to innovate. When female CEOs come on board, organizations are more likely to engage in creative activities. Research also reveals that female CEOs who head organizations are more likely to engage in new and creative business practices that are environment friendly. Moreover, developing nations are encouraged to accelerate the adoption of structural transformation initiatives that would provide women with access to information and technologies.Research limitations/implicationsThis research is limited to literature published between 2013 and 2022.Practical implicationsIt is important to select the organizational response to board female representation institutional logic to reflect the intended sort of performance. Organizational stakeholders were unfavorable to female leadership, implying that such perceptions harm women but benefit men.

Champions of gender equality: female and male executives as leaders of gender change,"de Vries, Jennifer Anne","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine male and female executives as leaders “championing” gender change interventions. It problematizes current exhortations for male leaders to lead gender change, much as they might lead any other business-driven change agenda. It argues that organizational gender scholarship is critical to understanding the gendered nature of championing. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on a feminist qualitative research project examining the efficacy of a gender intervention in a university and a policing institution. Interviews with four leaders have been chosen from the larger study for analysis against the backdrop of material from interviewees and the participant observation of the researcher. It brings a social constructionist view of gender and Acker’s gendering processes to bear on understanding organizational gender change. Findings – The sex/gender of the leader is inescapably fore-fronted by the gender change intervention. Gendered expectations and choices positioned men as powerful and effective champions while undermining the effectiveness of the woman in this study. Research limitations/implications – Further research examining male and female leaders capacity to champion gender change is required. Practical implications – This research identifies effective champion behaviors, provides suggestions for ensuring that gender equity interventions are well championed and proposes a partnership model where senior men and women play complementary roles leading gender change. Originality/value – This paper is of value to practitioners and scholars. It draws attention to contemporary issues of leadership and gender change, seeking to bridge the gap between theory and practice that undermines our change efforts.",2015,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",34,1,21-36,2084927148,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-05-2013-0031,,#753,deVries 2015,"",""
"Follow the Leader: A Relational Demography, Similarity Attraction, and Social Identity Theory of Leadership Approach of a Team's Performance","Wells, Janelle E; Aicher, Thomas J","While voluminous research exists on managerial successions and the decline of female head coaches, limited research has evaluated the impact of the coach's gender on a team's performance. Therefore, this study focused on gendered coaching successions to determine if the gender of the head coach influenced the team's performance when controlling extraneous variables (e.g., revenues, expenses, and team statistics). Utilizing the theoretical foundations of relational demography (Tsui et al. in Productivity and interpersonal relations in work teams characterized by diversity, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, pp 97-130,  1995 ) , similar-attraction paradigm (Byrne in The attraction paradigm. Academic Press, New York,  1971 ) and social identity theory of leadership (SITL; Hogg in Pers Social Psychol Rev 5:184-200,  2001 ), we hypothesized coaching successions to similar demographic leader-member dyad relationships would positively impact team performance. Data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Equity in Athletic Data Analysis websites were collected on all Division I women's basketball head coaching successions from 2003 to 2010.

Stepping Stones: Nine Lessons from Women Leaders in Academic Medicine,"Palmer, Megan M; Hoffmann-Longtin, Krista J; Walvoord, Emily C; Dankoski, Mary E","Women now make up half of all medical school matriculates; yet few women hold leadership positions in academic health centers. The reasons for this gender gap are complex and have been the subject of much discussion. However, the experiences of women who successfully ascend to positions of senior leadership are rarely examined. It is critical to develop a greater understanding of women's paths to leadership positions in order to inspire and enable more women to seek such opportunities. Using a semi-structured protocol, we interviewed 16 women leaders who were willing to share their career journeys in a public forum. These leaders were asked to share pivotal moments or milestones, referred to as ""stepping stones,"" in their careers. The interviews were taped, transcribed and analysed for significant patterns and consistent themes. Nine themes were identified and included: hold fast to your values; be open to unexpected opportunities; surround yourself with people who believe in you and people you believe in; be assertive in your communication and actions; continually refine your leadership skills; don't take things personally; stay organized; build positive relationships and welcoming environments; and when and if necessary, prove them wrong. The women leaders had strikingly similar lessons to share. This study develops a deeper understanding of the career paths of women in leadership positions, setting the stage for future study as well as encouraging and empowering more women to climb the leadership ladder.

Female educational leadership in the UK and Greece,"Mitrouss, Anastasia; Mitroussi, Kyriaki","The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on investigating the role of gender on educational leadership in the context of two differing cultures. The focus will be on exploring whether gender appears to impact on the leadership roles in education by examining the extent of female participation in leadership across educational levels in Greece and the UK, highlighting differences and similarities between them. This paper examines secondary data on a number of issues, like the proportion of women in lower and higher ranking teaching posts across education sectors. Such data are retrieved from official national and international statistics, such as UNESCO, Eurostat, the Office of National Statistics UK and the Higher Education Statistics Agency, UK, as well as previous academic studies. The results of the analysis reveal that in both countries, fewer women than men reach top rank positions in education, particularly in secondary and higher education. The investigation will rely on the use of secondary data collected from a number of diverse national and international sources as well as from existing literature. The choice of secondary data is judged to be appropriate on the basis of this paper and its research aim. Examination of women's presence across educational sectors in the two selected countries required obtaining information about actual and not representative, overall numbers or percentages of women in educational posts. Such information can only be positively retrieved by national or international, official statistics, while even these, the investigation revealed, can show variations between them. The paper should raise awareness to women's under-representation in leadership positions in education, especially at the secondary and the tertiary education levels. Leadership has been acknowledged as a decisive component in education namely due to the improvements it brings in many areas. The complexity and diversity surrounding leadership has turned attention to the effect of a number of factors on the practice of leadership educational context, such as gender and culture. Therefore, the present paper concentrates on an exploration of the effect of gender in leadership in education.

Advancing Women Into Educational Leadership in Developing Countries: The Case of Uganda,"Sperandio, Jill; Kagoda, Alice Merab","The need for women in leadership positions in schools in developing countries is important to ensure sensitivity within schools for the wellbeing of adolescent girls, to provide girls beginning to consider career choices with role models of women decision-makers and leaders, and to address issues of social justice by providing gender equity between adults within the education profession. This article examines the distribution of women in educational leadership in one developing country, Uganda in East Africa. It describes the potential leadership positions open to women in both public and private education, the qualifications and processes required to access them, and the reasons why women may not take advantage of the available opportunities. The article concludes with a discussion of the factors that must be considered when designing training to better position women to move into school leadership and countrywide educational decision-making. Women must be present in leadership positions in education systems worldwide to provide a gendered perspective on educational change and development, and to ensure social justice through gender equity at leadership and decision making levels. The 4th World Conference on Women (1995) called for governments worldwide to ""create a gender sensitive education system in order to ensure. . . full and equal participation of women in educational administration and policy and decision making"" (Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action [BPA], 1995, Chap. IV, Article 82). The BPA Mission Statement asserts that equality between women and men is not only a matter of human rights and a condition for social justice, but also a condition for ""people-centred sustainable development"" (BPA, 1995, section 1). The presence of women in leadership roles at the secondary school level and above contributes to sensitivity within schools for the well-being of adolescent girls and provides girls beginning to consider career choices with role models of women decision-makers and leaders. It is also imperative that women be actively involved in leading educational change given the vital role that the education system of a country plays in both national development and the development of a gender equal society. For women to be active participants in the change and development process, they must be present and provided with the necessary skills and understanding needed to participate effectively in educational leadership and policy-making at both school and national levels. Yet women remain under-represented in educational leadership in most developing countries, of which the Republic of Uganda in East Africa is one. Uganda has an excellent record of promoting gender equity in all aspects of life (Wakoko & Labao, 1996; Mutibwa, 1988; Kwesiga, 1997; Ministry of Gender And Community Development,1997, Ministry of Gender, Labour and Community Development,1999). The period from 1990 to the present has seen a rapid growth in the women's movement in Uganda. This has been evidenced by the encouragement of the establishment of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) promoting women's rights and their physical and economic well-being, the appointment of a woman Vice President and a number of female government ministers vocal on women's issues, and the hosting of a major international women's conference (Women's Worlds, 2002) to coincide with the opening of a new department of Women's Studies at Makerere University in the capital city of Kampala, amongst other developments (Ikiriza, 2002). In the field of education, attention has focused on accelerating girls' full and equal participation and retention in schools through a number of initiatives including the Girls' Education Movement (GEM) and the National Strategy for Girls' Education in Uganda, in combination with Universal Primary Education (UPE) providing both boys and girls with free primary education (Ministry of Education and Sports [MoES], 1997). Currently only 45% of the female population of secondary school age who have passed the primary school exit examinations attend secondary school, and relatively few girls (less than 10% of those enrolled at the primary level) access higher institutions of learning due to these low enrolment rates at the secondary level (MoES, 2006a ; MoES, 2004; Nsubuga, 2006). But Uganda, in common with the majority of other developing countries, still struggles to meet the goal of 30% representation of women in leadership roles in education and other areas that the Beijing Platform considered critical for women to have an impact on decision-making (BPA, 1995, sections 181,182). In this article I examine the distribution of women within the leadership of the secondary school sector, both government-aided and private, in Uganda. I use interview data collected during a month of fieldwork in Uganda in 2006 together with an analysis of documents and statistics provided by the Ministry of Education and Sports to describe the potential positions available to women within the context of policies at government and ministry levels. I examine the policies that earmark positions for women, the requirements women must meet and the processes they must go through when seeking access to these positions, using as a case study a 2005 recruitment drive for secondary school administrators. I consider the effect of an expanding private secondary school sector on the availability of leadership roles for women. I conclude the article with a discussion, from a critical feminist perspective, of the implications of the current pattern of women in leadership positions in Ugandan secondary school, together with suggestions for further research that could inform a model of leadership training for women in developing countries worldwide.

In Search of Leaders: Gender Factors in School Administration,"Hoff, Dianne L; Mitchell, Sidney N","Research points to a current and growing shortage of school leaders, yet qualified women are still under represented in school administration. The purpose of this study was to examine the career paths of male and female school leaders and their perceptions of gender factors that affect entry and advancement in leadership. Results reveal that gender socialization, belief in meritocracy, and the influence of patriarchy create a cycle of discrimination. Further, both men and women admitted the existence of gender barriers that disproportionately harm women. Implications for schools, university preparation programs, professional associations, and school leaders are discussed. . Across the country, school districts face a struggle in attracting and retaining talented leaders. Several studies have suggested reasons for this, including long hours, poor salaries, increased demands for accountability and an aging administrative workforce that is nearing retirement (Adams, 1999; Cooper, Fusarelli, & Carella 2000; Normore, 2004; RAND, 2003). School districts report shrinking applicant pools (NAESP, 2003) at a time when turnover rates are increasing, a trend which threatens to ""cut the legs out from under schools' ability to improve"" (Buckingham, Donaldson, & Marnik, 2006, p. 37). A leadership crisis appears to be on the horizon, which will challenge the entire profession to think differently about school leadership and who will fill leadership roles. At the same time, university programs in educational leadership are thriving and schools are loaded with talented teachers. There is a puzzling disconnection between supply and demand for leaders which cannot be completely explained by the disincentives that accompany school administrative roles. The fact that women represent only 18% of the nation's superintendents (Grogan & Brunner, 2005), in comparison to 75% of the nation's teaching force (U.S. Department of Education, 2005), may shed light on the problem. Indeed, a qualified talent pool does exist, and statistics show that this pool consists increasingly of women, who for some time have represented the largest percentage of both the teaching profession and educational leadership preparation programs (Grogan & Brunner, 2005; Shakeshaft, 1999). Yet women remain underrepresented in leadership roles, particularly in high school principalships and superintendencies, the positions that carry the most responsibility and influence and highest salaries (Grogan & Brunner 2005; Keller, 1999; Shakeshaft, 1999). Numerous scholars have argued that gender-related factors often deter women from entering school administrative roles and impede their progress toward advancement (e.g., Estler, 1975; Grady, 1992; Marshall & Kasten, 1994; Valian, 1999). One such factor is the persistence of gender norms, which appears frequently in the literature and warrants a brief discussion.

Institutionalizing Inequalities in Canadian Universities: The Canada Research Chairs Program,"Side, Katherine; Robbins, Wendy","To position Canada as a world leader in the ""knowledge-based"" economy, in 2000, the Canadian government established a multi-million-dollar initiative to appoint 2,000 scholars as Canada Research Chairs (CRC). Women are seriously underrepresented among CRC research ""stars,"" and no data are kept for other equity groups. Eight women initiated a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in 2003 in an attempt to remedy inequities, and a national discussion has ensued over excellence and equity. We provide a brief outline of the CRC Program and demonstrate how it perpetuates a narrow conception of innovation and excellence, which further institutionalizes inequalities for women and faculty members from other equity groups in Canadian universities. We describe the strategy of the human rights complaint and remedies negotiated in the settlement of 2006. We argue for a broader conceptualization and contextualization of ""excellence,"" and for research not in the private, but the public good.

Drawing parallels with an emerging and impressive body of work on the gender gap in STEM, the authors raise many questions to propel research in this area forward. One, in particular, concerning 'the content of early beliefs and attitudes about political leadership' struck us as especially intriguing. Before understanding the specifics of political leadership, we argue that a close examination of the way that people construe and define leadership more broadly is helpful. We know much concerning the masculine construal of leadership among adults and its implications for perpetuating gender discrimination and discouraging women’s participation in leadership. However, far less is known concerning how children construe leadership—a gap that raises a number of questions: When do stereotypes about leadership emerge among children? Do these leadership stereotypes change over the lifespan, and if so, how? Furthermore, to what extent do stereotypes about leadership in childhood and adolescence resemble the content of leadership stereotypes in adulthood? Our focus in this commentary is the content and development of leadership stereotypes. We frame our discussion by first considering several theories alluded to in the target article and continue by reviewing what is known about beliefs and attitudes about leadership among adults. Using the organizational literature on leadership and gender as a starting point, we consider the gaps that exist in our knowledge of how children construe leadership and review several new and existing findings that raise additional questions for future research.

Medical student leader performance in an applied medical field practicum,"Barry, Erin S.; Dong, Ting; Durning, Steven J.; Schreiber-Gregory, Deanna; Torre, Dario; Grunberg, Neil E.","Introduction: Many medical schools in the United States are introducing leader and leadership curricula. However, there is a large gap regarding how to assess leader performance during undergraduate medical education. With the guidance of a conceptual framework, leadership assessment measures can be developed, learners can make expected improvements in performance over time, and assessment measures can be used in relevant, applied, medical teaching settings. Uniformed Services University (USU) medical students are educated to become healthcare leaders who can perform effectively in various settings. Medical students are assessed on multiple occasions for elements of leader performance during 'Operation Bushmaster' – the capstone military medical field practicum event for fourth year medical students—by experienced faculty. A conceptual framework guides the assessment approach for leader performance during Bushmaster. The USU Leader and Leadership Education and Development program developed an assessment tool to measure student leader performance used in a military medical field practicum. The present paper examines whether: (1) leader performance can be measured at Bushmaster; (2) leader performance changed during Bushmaster; (3) leader performance elements are related to each other; and (4) overall leader performance is related to other medical academic performance. Materials and Methods: Trained faculty assessed students’ leader performance. Data from three cohorts of USU medical students (N = 509) were collected. All data were collected, compiled, deidentified, and analyzed with approval from the USU Institutional Review Board (Protocol number: KM83XV). Descriptive statistics, repeated measures t-tests, trend analyses, and correlation analyses were performed. Results: Data were available from 483/509 [95%] students. Results revealed that: (1) average leader performance was satisfactory; (2) overall leader performance and performance on each of the major elements of leader performance significantly improved over the course of Bushmaster; (3) major elements of leader performance were significantly correlated with each other and with overall leader performance; (4) leader performance was not correlated with students’ performance on the MCAT total score or USMLE Step exam scores. Conclusion: With the guidance of a conceptual framework, the assessment tool was used to assess leader performance in a relevant, applied, medical teaching setting. The findings of this study indicate that leader performance can be measured. Additionally, leader performance appears to be a separate skillset from medical academic performance and both types of performance can be taught and developed. This was a retrospective correlation study and was conducted during a military medical field practicum at a single institution. Gathering additional validity evidence of the assessment tool is needed. With additional validity evidence, the assessment tool could be applied to other medical exercises in different settings and help with the assessment of leader performance beyond medical school.

Psychosocial distress among unpaid community health workers in rural Ethiopia: Comparing leaders in Ethiopia's Women's Development Army to their peers,"Maes, Kenneth; Closser, Svea; Tesfaye, Yihenew; Abesha, Roza","There is a growing critical social science literature on volunteering in health programs in non-western, low-income countries, yet few have mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the psychological and social wellbeing of unpaid community health workers in such contexts. We address this issue with data from unpaid community health workers (CHWs) and other women who comprise Ethiopia's state-organized Women's Development Army. We draw on qualitative and cross-sectional survey data collected between 2013 and 2016 to test links between various aspects of psychosocial and economic wellbeing and volunteer status in a rural context. We surveyed 422 adult women in Amhara state, 73 of whom were unpaid CHWs in the 'Army'. We also conducted interviews and focus group discussions with health officials, salaried Health Extension Workers, volunteer CHWs, and other adult women. Analyses of our qualitative and quantitative datasets show that volunteer CHWs are actually worse off than their peers in various psychosocial and economic respects, and that CHW recruitment processes are the most likely explanation for this difference. Additionally, the unpaid CHW position adds work to already burdened shoulders, and makes women—especially unmarried women—vulnerable to negative gossip and high levels of psychological distress. To a limited extent, the volunteer CHW position also bolsters married women's subjective socioeconomic status and confidence in achieving future gains in status. By showing that unpaid CHWs do not necessarily enjoy psychosocial benefits, and may experience harm as a result of their work, these findings reinforce the recommendation that CHWs in contexts of poverty be paid and better supported.

The stories that make us: Leaders’ origin stories and temporal identity work,"Zheng, Wei; Meister, Alyson; Caza, Brianna Barker","The stories we tell about our origins can shape how we think and act – helping us make sense of and communicate who we have 'become' over time. To better understand the role that origin stories play in individuals’ work lives, we explore how 92 men and women leaders make sense of 'becoming' a leader (origin stories) and 'doing' leadership (enactment stories). We find that, despite the uniqueness of their experiences, their narratives converge around four frames, being, engaging, performing, and accepting, through which they understand, articulate, and enact their leader identities. We theorize that these narrative frames serve as sensemaking and identity work devices which allow them to create temporal coherence, validate their leader identity claims, and offer them behavioral scripts. Our findings also unearth key gender differences in the use of these frames, in that men used the performing frame more often and women tended toward the engaging frame. These findings provide novel insights into the ways in which the gendered context of leadership becomes embedded in leaders’ understandings of who they are and what they intend to do in their roles.

Community detection with opinion leaders’ identification for promoting collaborative problem-based learning performance,"Chen, Chih-Ming; You, Zong-Lin","In the 21st century when knowledge-based economy is emphasized, the cultivation of autonomous learning and problem-solving abilities presents the importance. With web-based collaborative problem-based learning (CPBL), learners could more conveniently cultivate their problem-solving abilities through autonomous learning. Nevertheless, learners are often guided to solve a target problem by the information announced by teachers during the CPBL processes. Individual learners often could not effectively absorb such standard information, thus ignoring the important information from teachers. In the information communication theory, the two-step flow of communication through opinion leaders has been proved that it can better change audiences’ attitudes than the one-step flow of communication through mass media. This study thus employs the modularity Q function as the fitness function of genetic algorithm to optimally detect learning communities and uses PageRank measure to accurately find out community opinion leaders according to the social network interaction data of learners in the CPBL process. Based on quasi-experimental design, this study examines whether learners in the experimental group using the two-step flow of communication through opinion leaders to convey information for solving the target CPBL missions could more significantly enhance web-based CPBL performance, social network interaction and group cohesion than learners in the control group using the one-step flow of communication through teachers’ information. Analytical results show learners in the experimental group remarkably outperform those in the control group on learning performance and peer interaction under a CPBL environment. Particularly, female learners in the experimental group notably outperform female learners in the control group on learning performance, while there is no significant difference in male learners between both groups. More importantly, learners in the experimental group present significantly higher group cohesion than those in the control group. This study confirms that using the two-step flow of communication instead of the one-step flow of communication traditionally used in web-based learning environments could significantly promote web-based CPBL performance, social network interaction and group cohesion. © 2018 British Educational Research Association.",2019,,British Journal of Educational Technology,50,4,1846-1864,,10.1111/bjet.12673,,#782,Chen 2019,"",""
The role of leadership and communication in internal city branding,"Piehler, R.; Roessler, A.; Burmann, C.","Purpose This study aims to investigate the brand-oriented leadership of a city's mayor and city online brand communication as brand management-related antecedents of residents' city brand commitment. It thus examines if city brand managers can apply internal branding concepts from the corporate branding domain in a city branding context. Design/methodology/approach The relationships between the brand management-related antecedents and the internal city branding (ICB) objective are tested through structural equation modeling using cross-sectional survey data of 414 residents of a German city. Findings Both the brand-oriented leadership of the mayor in terms of acting as a role model by living the city brand and its identity and by showing commitment to the brand and the city's online brand communication in terms of its quality have positive effects on residents' city brand commitment. Moderation analyses reveal no significant differences between the path estimates for age, place of birth, duration of residency and education. However, the results differ significantly for gender. Research limitations/implications As this study's sample is limited to only one city in Germany, further research needs to investigate the relationships in different cities and other countries to ensure the generalizability of the results. Future studies might also include other aspects of city brand communication, as well as cognitive and behavioural ICB objectives. Practical implications To increase residents' city brand commitment, city brand managers should ensure that a city's online brand communication is adequate, complete, credible, useful and clear. Furthermore, through creating awareness for the importance of a mayor's brand-oriented leadership and through educating and training the mayor to engage in this specific form of brand-oriented transformational leadership, city brand managers can increase residents' emotional attachment with the city brand. Originality/value This study integrates internal branding research from the corporate branding domain with place and city branding research.

Using Team-Based Learning to Promote Engineering Students' Performance and Self-Efficacy in a Technical Writing Class,"Zha, Shenghua; Wu, Shenghua; Estis, Julie M.","Introduction: Technical writing is an essential skill set for engineering students. Many studies have been conducted, but very few have used experimental or quasiexperimental design to identify an optimal instructional method in a technical writing class. Situating the case: Team-based learning (TBL) is a well-structured learning method that prior studies have found to enhance students' academic performance. TBL includes individual and collaborative learning activities from lower to higher cognitive levels. Peer leadership, as evidenced in other studies, uses appointed student leaders to promote equal and active group participation and shows a potential to solve the gender issue found in engineering class collaborations. About the case: In this case, we infused peer leadership in TBL in three technical writing sessions of an engineering lab class. Appointed student leaders were responsible for initiating and sustaining discussions, asking each group member's input, and seeking collective decisions on solutions. The other class used traditional TBL activities. Methods/approach: Nonparametric analyses were conducted to compare students' technical writing skills and self-efficacy, as well as gender differences in two classes. Results/discussion: Students in the peer-led TBL class showed better technical writing skill retention than their counterparts in the traditional TBL class. The gender difference was identified in the traditional TBL class. However, we did not find any difference in students' self-efficacy between the peer-led and traditional TBL sections, though both observed a significant improvement at the end.

Guppies Prefer to Follow Large (Robot) Leaders Irrespective of Own Size,"Bierbach, David; Monck, Hauke J.; Lukas, Juliane; Habedank, Marie; Romanczuk, Pawel; Landgraf, Tim; Krause, Jens","Body size is often assumed to determine how successfully an individual can lead others with larger individuals being better leaders than smaller ones. But even if larger individuals are more readily followed, body size often correlates with specific behavioral patterns and it is thus unclear whether larger individuals are more often followed than smaller ones because of their size or because they behave in a certain way. To control for behavioral differences among differentially-sized leaders, we used biomimetic robotic fish (Robofish) of different sizes. Live guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are known to interact with Robofish in a similar way as with live conspecifics. Consequently, Robofish may serve as a conspecific-like leader that provides standardized behaviors irrespective of its size. We asked whether larger Robofish leaders are preferentially followed and whether the preferences of followers depend on own body size or risk-taking behavior (""boldness""). We found that live female guppies followed larger Robofish leaders in closer proximity than smaller ones and this pattern was independent of the followers’ own body size as well as risk-taking behavior.

Likeability versus Competence Dilemma: Text Mining Approach Using LinkedIn Data,"Erfani, Abdolmajid; Hickey, Paul J.; Cui, Qingbin","Women are significantly underrepresented in construction and engineering industry leadership roles despite having comparable qualifications, experience, and degrees. Improvements require a better understanding of the factors leading to the underrepresentation of females in the construction industry. While prior studies report that a male-dominated culture in construction negatively impacts females' career advancement, minimal research explores the role congruity theory and the likeability and competency dilemma among construction leaders. When striving to succeed in traditionally male-dominated fields, women face a unique challenge because they need to defy gender stereotypes created by cultural norms, encapsulated by the likeability versus competency dilemma. Females who accomplish traditionally male tasks and demonstrate independence, assertiveness, self-reliance, and power are no longer seen as likeable. Through analyzing publicly available LinkedIn recommendations, this paper proposed a data-driven approach for examining the likeability and competency dilemma for female construction leaders. Results showed that female leaders in construction were seen as competent in the same way as their male counterparts, but far less likeable (a likeability score of 28% compared to 51% for males). Developing a text mining model to predict the gender of the person receiving a recommendation, this paper also highlights unconscious bias in describing and reacting to leaders' successes. The machine learning model accurately predicted the gender of the person receiving the recommendation with more than 86% accuracy. Despite possessing the sufficient capability to handle traditionally male work successfully, women receive negative judgment from colleagues, creating challenges in their career paths. Finally, the paper contributes to social role theory and role congruity theory by highlighting the differences in gender roles and leadership roles for women in the construction industry. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2023,,Journal of Management in Engineering,39,3,,,10.1061/JMENEA.MEENG-5213,,#803,Erfani 2023,"",""

Yet, others draw on the queen-bee syndrome to postulate that some female CEOs may rather strengthen gender-pay disparities in upper echelons – by favoring out-groups (male) more than their in-groups (female). We bring together these opposing theoretical arguments to develop a ‘beyond CEO gender’ perspective, arguing that the effects of CEO gender on TMT gender-pay disparities should be considered in conjunction with the corporate leaders' values – as reflected by their political ideology. Our research demonstrates that conservative-female CEOs compensate female (versus male) executives lower compared to all other CEO gender-ideology categories (i.e., female-liberal CEOs, male-liberal CEOs, and male-conservative CEOs). Overall, our work contributes to theory on the CEO-TMT interface by highlighting the role of the CEO as the ‘architect’ of executive remuneration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Long Range Planning,55,3,,,10.1016/j.lrp.2021.102126,,#806,Kalogeraki 2022,"",""
"Impact of Provider Prior Use of HIE on System Complexity, Performance, Patient Care, Quality and System Concerns","Feldman, S.S.; Hikmet, N.; Modi, S.; Schooley, B.","To date, most HIE studies have investigated user perceptions of value prior to use. Few studies have assessed factors associated with the value of HIE through its actual use. This study investigates provider perceptions on HIE comparing those who had prior experience vs those who had no experience with it. In so doing, we identify six constructs: prior use, system complexity, system concerns, public/population health, care delivery, and provider performance. This study uses a mixed methods approach to data collection. From 15 interviews of medical community leaders, a survey was constructed and administered to 263 clinicians. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance was used, along with Tukey HSD tests for multiple comparisons. Results indicated providers whom previously used HIE had more positive perceptions about its benefits in terms of system complexity (p = .001), care delivery (p = .000), population health (p = .003), and provider performance (p = .005); women providers were more positive in terms of system concerns (p = .000); patient care (p = .031), and population health (p = .009); providers age 44-55 were more positive than older and younger groups in terms of patient care (p = .032), population health (p = .021), and provider performance (p = .014); while differences also existed across professional license groups (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)) for all five constructs (p p = .017), population health (p = .018), and provider performance (p = .018). There were no statistically significant differences found between groups based on a provider's role in an organization (patient care, administration, teaching/research, other). Different provider perspectives about the value derived from HIE use exist depending on prior experience with HIE, age, gender, license (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)), and type of organization setting (hospital, ambulatory clinic, medical office, other). This study draws from the theory of planned behavior to understand factors related to physicians' perceptions about HIE value, serving as a departure point for more detailed investigations of provider perceptions and behavior in regard to future HIE use and promoting interoperability.",2022,/,Information Systems Frontiers,24,1,121-31,,10.1007/s10796-020-10064-x,,#807,Feldman 2022,"",""

Fuzzy detection of leadership for learning perceived by principals and teachers,Yun-Chin Tai; Dian-Fu Chang,"This study aims to determine different perspectives on leadership for learning (LL) in current education settings. A total of 51 participants voluntarily joined this study, including 23 (45.1%) principals and 28 (54%) teachers from elementary schools in Taiwan. Of all the participants, 45.1% (n = 23) were male and 54.9% (n = 28) were female. Using the self-designed fuzzy questionnaire, we employed means and Wilcoxon rank-sum test (WRST) to evaluate principals' and teachers' different perceptions of leadership for learning. The findings reveal that principals had higher perceptions of LL, compared with teachers, while the gender did not display significant difference with WRST.

Board gender diversity and ESG performance: The mediating role of temporal orientation in South Africa context,"Abdelkader, M.G.; Gao, Y.; Elamer, A.A.","Prevailing research on the interaction between board gender diversity (BGD) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance presents equivocal findings, particularly in the context of developing countries. This study ventures into an exploratory examination of this association, situated in the socio-cultural milieu of South Africa, a region where the lower social status of women often leads to a bias towards short-term perspectives. Drawing on the role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders, this study aims to investigate the mediating role of short-term orientation (SHRT) in the BGD-ESG relationship. We further explore how the preference of female directors toward SHRT varies depending on their tenure on the board and across family and non-family firms. The empirical findings, drawn from an examination of publicly listed non-financial firms on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2015 to 2020, indicate a negative relationship between BGD and ESG, with SHRT predominantly mediating this association. Additionally, the tenure of female directors attenuates their preference for SHRT. Notably, we found the effect of BGD on SHRT is less pronounced in family firms, where the choices of female directors are more aligned with the family firm's long-term orientation. Our findings contribute to both theory and practice by advancing our understanding of the BGD-ESG relationship and providing practical implications for organizations, leaders, and policymakers.

Oman's labour force: an analysis of gender in management,"Kemp, L.J.; Madsen, S.R.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of affairs in the Sultanate of Oman for the presence (or absence) of women in senior and managerial roles in private companies. The study also investigates where women are located within the organisations (e.g. as board members, chief officers, vice presidents, top management, division or unit heads). Design/methodology/approach - This is a quantitative study that analysed gender in the largest 122 private and publicly listed organisations in Oman. The study is based on data available from the Zawya database that tracks information about companies in the Middle East and North Africa region. Findings - Women are employed in Oman in small numbers when compared with the number of men. Women remain extremely underrepresented in senior roles in Omani organisations currently. Women are found slightly (but not significantly) more in departmental management roles (particularly in human resource management, marketing/communication, public relations, and project management) and in the transport and finance industries. Research limitations/implications - The Zawya database did not contain complete data on each company analysed. Hence, this is a descriptive study and lacked advanced statistical techniques for comparison and relationship analysis. Practical implications - This study increases the academic knowledge on international issues in gender and management. The study also provides insights for government leaders, educators, and scholars who work to help prepare women for leadership in this region.

How leaders influence followers through the use of nonverbal communication,"Talley, L.; Temple, S.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to address the relationship between a leader’s use of nonverbal immediacy (specific hand gestures) and followers’ attraction to the leader. This study provides initial evidence that certain hand gestures are more effective than others at creating immediacy between leaders and followers. Design/methodology/approach – In an experimental study, participants (male=89; female=121) were shown one of three videos of an actor, as leader, using three positive hand gestures, three defensive hand gestures, and no hand gestures, which have not been previously operationalized (and were grouped arbitrarily by the experimenter). Three hypotheses were tested using a 3×2 ANOVA (by group and gender) for main and interactional effects. Findings – The independent variable, positive hand gestures (M=2.4), was perceived by participants as more immediate than the other two independent variables, defensive hand gestures (M=−19.2) or no hand gestures (M=−21.6). Analysis of data indicate that participants perceived leaders with no hand gestures and defensive hand gestures to be distant or non-immediate and the leader with positive hand gestures to be more immediate or attractive. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited as a pilot study establishing differences between specific hand gestures for the first time. Practical implications – The research provides initial evidence that the hand gestures arbitrarily defined as “positive” create more immediacy between the followers and the leader than usage of “negative” gestures and no gestures. Social implications – The current research can act as a motivator for leaders to fast forward relationships with followers through the use of specific hand gestures. Originality/value – The results suggest the possibility that some hand gestures are more effective than others.",2015,/,Leadership & Organization Development Journal,36,1,69-80,,10.1108/LODJ-07-2013-0107,,#813,Talley 2015,"",""

We present demographic data based on surveys of its members from 2014, 2015 and 2016, during the fourth phase of SDSS (SDSS-IV). We find about half of SDSS-IV collaboration members were based in North America, a quarter in Europe, and the remainder in Asia and Central and South America. Overall, 26%-36% are women (from 2014 to 2016), up to 2% report non-binary genders. 11%-14% report that they are racial or ethnic minorities where they live. The fraction of women drops with seniority, and is also lower among collaboration leadership. Men in SDSS-IV were more likely to report being in a leadership role, and for the role to be funded and formally recognized. SDSS-IV collaboration members are twice as likely to have a parent with a college degree, than the general population, and are ten times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. This trend is slightly enhanced for female collaboration members. Despite this, the fraction of first generation college students is significant (31%). This fraction increased among collaboration members who are racial or ethnic minorities (40%-50%), and decreased among women (15%-25%). SDSS-IV implemented many inclusive policies and established a dedicated committee, the Committee on INclusiveness in SDSS. More than 60% of the collaboration agree that the collaboration is inclusive; however, collaboration leadership more strongly agree with this than the general membership.

Trunk postural control in unstable sitting: Effect of sex and low back pain status,"Lariviere, Christian; Gagnon, Dany H.; Mecheri, Hakim","Background Adequate neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine is required to prevent lumbar injuries. A trunk postural control test protocol, controlling for the influence of body size on performance, was implemented to carry out between-subject comparisons. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of sex and low back pain status with the use of two measures of trunk postural control, the first based on chair motion, and the second based on trunk motion. Methods Thirty-six subjects (with and without low back pain) performed three 60-s trunk postural control trials with their eyes closed while seated on an instrumented wobble chair, following a calibration procedure. Chair and trunk angular kinematics were measured with an optoelectronic system. A chair-based stabilogram and a trunk-based (lumbar spine) stabilogram were created using the angular motions produced in the sagittal and frontal planes. Twenty body-sway measures were computed for each stabilogram. Findings The calibration task efficiently controlled for the influence of body size. Several sex effects were detected, with most of them originating from the trunk-based measures. Subjects with low back pain and healthy controls showed comparable trunk postural control. Interpretation Sex differences were substantiated for the first time, but almost only with the trunk-based stabilogram, showing that the kinematic information captured on the trunk segments is quite different from what is captured on the wobble chair. Contrary to previous studies, pain status was not related to lowered trunk postural control, which can be attributed to the patients recruited or measurement reliability issues. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Activism from the global feminist movement has applied multi-dimensional coercive and normative pressures to develop a ""pipeline"" and ""catalyst"" for women's board appointments. Simultaneously, the absence of targeted action on other diversities and the intensification of directors' professional requirements have institutionalized the group's social and demographic profile.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThese findings are relevant to policymakers and corporations, highlighting the role of social movements for disrupting the status quo and the multidimensional institutional pressures needed to destructure entrenched appointment practices. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2024,/,Corporate Governance: An International Review,32,4,625-44,,10.1111/corg.12559,,#818,Wright 2024,"",""
A thorn by any other name: the acceptability of terminology for subtle slights in UK workplaces,"Smith, I.A.; Griffiths, A.","Purpose Employers are increasingly attempting to mitigate subtle but harmful forms of employee rudeness and slights. These include ""microaggressions"", ""everyday discrimination"" and ""workplace incivility"", among others. It is unclear which of these various terms is most acceptable for introducing the topic in the workplace. This paper explores human resources (HR) leaders' considerations about the terms and the organisational context that allow for successful implementation. Design/methodology/approach 16 expert interviews were conducted with HR leaders from large organisations in the United Kingdom. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to explore interview transcripts. Findings HR leaders reflected on various terms for subtle slights, largely according to how understandable (coherent) and emotionally resonant (provocative) they appeared. They did not converge on any universally accepted term. Less abstract terms were regarded as most acceptable for a broad audience. There was a view that leaders, often representing dominant groups, would find provocative terms such as microaggressions less acceptable than under-represented groups; the latter would find their experiences of subtle slights validated by terms such as microaggressions. Participants suggested that understanding the need for change was a necessary precursor to participation in training. Compliance-based approaches were considered less helpful. Implications for the design of training initiatives are presented whereby several terms could be used and explained.

Gender and innovation policy in Canada and Sweden,"Rowe, A.M.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a comparative case study of national innovation system in Canada and Sweden from the perspective of gender equality. The case study focuses on public policy to illuminate the formal aspects of innovation systems as they are conceived by the state in relation to gender, diversity and social inclusion. Formal policy measures are contrasted with interview data to provide a holistic picture of innovation policy as it relates to gender equality in both countries. Design/methodology/approach - This paper relies on data from 44 qualitative interviews with innovation leaders in the public sector, private sector and academia in Canada and Sweden, as well as a sample of innovation and gender experts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in Paris, France, between 2012 and 2014. The theoretical framework draws on feminist institutionalism to explain the gendered interactions of institutions in innovation spaces. Findings - This study finds that Sweden is a global policy leader in the development of gender-conscious innovation policy, while Canada has yet to consider a gender-conscious approach to innovation policy. Gender-conscious innovation policy norms have not traveled across the OECD because of administrative solos and political opportunity structures. Research/limitations implications - Each of the people contacted to sit for an interview was chosen primarily on their professional title and their ability to speak from a place of knowledge about innovation in their country and or industry, and this creates a success bias within the study focusing on the knowledge of elites in the field. Practical implications - This study explores how policy might be re-imagined to support gender equality and diversity, thus changing the institutional landscape to support a wider range of innovations and distributing the benefits of innovation in a more equitable way.

Navigating the family business: a gendered analysis of identity construction of daughters,"Hytti, U.; Alsos, G.A.; Heinonen, J.; Ljunggren, E.","Previous research has explored the difficulties daughters experience entering family business management, but few studies have focused on their experiences of succession. Previously, a gender-as-a-variable perspective has been widely adopted such that the gendering of succession remains understudied. This article addresses this gap by conducting a gendered analysis of how daughters navigate family businesses and construct identities as family business leaders. Using narrative analysis and case study research, our findings suggest that daughters construct and negotiate their gender and leadership identities in their interactions with others by opposing, expanding and making use of the gendered scripts available to them. They move between concealing their leader identity and producing a masculinised identity as a strong owner. This necessitates tempered disruption and switching between different identities in different contexts. We conclude by discussing the theoretical aspects of a gendered perspective as they relate to identity construction in family businesses.",2017,,International Small Business Journal,35,6,665-86,,10.1177/0266242616675924,,#827,Hytti 2017,"",""

The first rest phase was followed by the load phase, in which the subjects were administered a 20-minute sustained attention test. The number of correct answers and errors was evaluated. A BIOPAC apparatus continually recorded thoracic respiration, electrodermal activity, finger temperature, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Females on pads made 58% fewer errors than females on chairs; the number of errors was closely related to the depth of their breathing (tidal volume).

Validation of dimensions of the learning organization questionnaire (DLOQ) in a Vietnamese context,"Nguyen-Duc, T.; Phuong, T.T.; Le, T.T.B.; Nguyen, L.T.T.","Purpose. The main purpose of this study was to validate the Dimensions of Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ) in a Vietnamese context. Using the DLOQ as a research tool, this study also investigated the impact of demographic features on participants' perceptions of learning organizations (LOs). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 748 valid responses to a version of the DLOQ translated into Vietnamese. Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis were used to test the reliable internal consistency and validity of the DLOQ in a Vietnamese context. Then, one-way ANOVA analyses and independent sample t-tests were used to assess the differences produced by the characteristics of respondents and their enterprises. Findings. The results of this study show that three versions of the DLOQ are applicable to a Vietnamese context. The findings of this study also suggest that several demographic features produced significant differences in respondents' perceptions of organizational learning. Research limitations/implications. There are several limitations of this study. First, this study used self-reporting, and individual perspectives of questions can bring about perception bias. Also, the length of the original version of the DLOQ (i.e. 43 questions) might impact the results, because of participants' lack of patience and focus. In addition, various levels of organizational learning may cause some confusion, leading to misinterpretation. Finally, the overrepresentation of large state-owned enterprises in the service industry in the sample may have caused bias when interpreting the results. Future research should be conducted to further validate and extend the findings of this study for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 98% of businesses in Vietnam. It is strongly suggested that scholars use the validated Vietnamese DLOQ to measure the impacts of learning culture on learning-related results in Vietnam, such as individual/team/organizational performance, staff satisfaction and so on. Finally, future research should consider making appropriate study designs to collect and analyze data from various resources and not be limited to self-reported questionnaires. This would minimize common method bias. Practical implications. Application of the DLOQ provides valuable insights and understanding for use in designing and evaluating efforts to learn at all levels in Vietnamese enterprises. Social implications. Regarding designing, adjusting and implementing strategies to boost the learning capacity of an organization, the findings of this study also imply that business leaders and practitioners in Vietnamese enterprises can build strategies for enhancing LO culture without biases stemming from gender or management level. However, education level and work experience should be considered critical features that could impact the effectiveness of such strategies. Also, understanding and applying the DLOQ when building LOs will promote Vietnamese businesses' competitiveness and international integration. Originality/value. Using statistical results, this study confirmed that a rigorously translated Vietnamese version of the DLOQ produced reliable measurement scores with a construct validity sufficient to measure LOs in a Vietnamese context.",2023,/,Learning Organization,,,511-31,,10.1108/TLO-04-2022-0041,,#830,Nguyen-Duc 2023,"",""
Test-Retest Reliability of a Pendant-Worn Sensor Device in Measuring Chair Rise Performance in Older Persons,"Wei Zhang; Regterschot, G.R.H.; Schaabova, H.; Baldus, H.; Zijlstra, W.","Chair rise performance is incorporated in clinical assessments to indicate fall risk status in older persons. This study investigated the test-retest reliability of a pendant-sensor-based assessment of chair rise performance. Forty-one older persons (28 females, 13 males, age: 72-94) were assessed in two sessions with 3 to 8 days in between. Repeated chair rise transfers were measured after different instructions. Relative and absolute test-retest reliability of chair rise measurements in individual tests and average over all tests were evaluated by means of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM) as a percentage of the measurement mean. Systematic bias between the measurements in test and retest was examined with paired t-tests. Heteroscedasticity of the measurements was visually checked with Bland-Altman plots. In the different test conditions, the ICCs ranged between 0.63 and 0.93, and the SEM% ranged between 5.7% and 21.2%. The relative and absolute reliability of the average over all tests were ICC = 0.86 and SEM% = 9.5% for transfer duration, ICC = 0.93 and SEM% = 9.2% for maximum vertical acceleration, and ICC = 0.89 and SEM% = 10.0% for peak power.

An assessment of workplace wellness policies and programs of universities in the Asia-Pacific,"Hsiao, V.; Stoltzfus, N.; Withers, M.","BACKGROUND:Universities could positively impact the health and well-being of employees through workplace wellness programs (WWP).OBJECTIVE:To assess the prevalence of WWP among Asia-Pacific universities, identify gaps and challenges, and solutions to challenges.METHODS:An online survey was sent to members of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities to assess programs on physical fitness, nutrition/weight, mental health/stress, family support, chronic disease prevention, and safety.RESULTS:Employees at 28 universities in 13 economies completed the survey on behalf of their university. Most common WWP were paid maternity/paternity leave (89.3% /85.7%), disaster preparedness training (85.7%), fitness challenges (78.6%), written policies regarding discrimination/hate speech (75.0%), and quiet rest areas (71.4%). However, few addressed childcare, breastfeeding support, workplace sexual harassment, tobacco use, or mental health. Programs rarely aligned with the reported goal of increasing employee morale, but instead resulted from government mandates. Many universities offered sporadic, one-off programs but lacked comprehensive, coordinated programming and adequate evaluation procedures. Key challenges were low employee participation, limited budget, and lack of leadership support.

Assessment of Diversity Outcomes in American Medical School Admissions: Applying the Grutter Legitimacy Principles,"Baugh, A.; Baugh, R.F.","In the last 30 years, except for female participation, the enrollment of Latinx, African Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan natives, and disadvantaged students in medical school has been constant; however, increasing enrollment of these minority populations is feasible, if admissions committees make two changes in approach. First, the traditional belief that matriculation merit is a linear function of past academic performance must be rejected. Second, once the threshold needed to complete medical school in four years and to pass licensing examinations at the first attempt has been met, all candidates are equally qualified, and matriculation decisions must be based, in part, on societal interests. In Grutter vs. Bollinger, the United States Supreme Court determined that graduate admission committees can and should consider societal interests. Each admission decision represents a substantial government investment in each student, as the Medicare Act directly subsidizes much of the cost of medical education. As Grutter explained, there is a societal interest in the public having confidence in, and access to, the medical school training that will prepare tomorrow’s medical, professional, and political leaders. Our analysis suggests that medical school admissions are biased towards academic achievement in matriculants, beyond acceptable thresholds for graduation and licensure. We believe medical schools must shift their admissions strategies and consider noncognitive factors in all candidates as determinative once minimum acceptable academic standards have been met.",2020,06/,Sustainability,12,12,5211 (17 pp.),,10.3390/su12125211,,#837,Baugh 2020,"",""
Psychogeography - providing a lens on corporate culture and its potential impact on career success: a novel and efficient approach,"Wardale, D.; Lord, L.","Psychogeography refers to the loose interface between psychology and geography. Specifically it examines how we impact on the environment and the environment impacts on us. As a process it involves intimately observing the environment and seeing what may have been previously unobserved. Participants then construct meaning from these observations. This paper describes how we used a time-limited psychogeography approach followed immediately by a focus group as research method. The aim was to determine if examining participants’ work environment would potentially enable them to identify enablers and barriers to career success. The findings from these two short interventions are compared to the more often used semi-structured interview approach to reveal that the psychogeography provided another lens to the research. Interestingly factors that were uncovered in the psychogeography and focus groups were generally different to those identified in the interviews. The participants were a group of high-potential academic women at a large public university in Western Australia. They were enrolled in a career and leadership development program aimed at assisting women access promotions and other senior roles leadership within the university Much of the women’s career development literature focuses on ‘fixing women’ and not the system. To that end we wanted to use a method, in addition to interview questions, to uncover aspects of the corporate environment that might impact on women’s decisions to progress their careers. We asked participants to dérive, stroll or wander within their university campus with a view to observing any ‘career enablers and barriers at work’. To not impose any further burden on their time, and to manage the wealth of data generated by the psychogeography, we asked the women to immediately share their insights through a structured focus group discussion. Participants found the psychogeography exercise a novel approach to discovering and rediscovering their work environment. The findings revealed aspects of the work environment that had not previously been overt. These included participants’ appreciation of students having fun and a carnival atmosphere within the campus yet a simultaneous concern at the lack of quiet spaces to support scholarship and research; a disparity of investment in infrastructure improvements across various schools and faculties, which led to discussions of how disparately workload was managed by different managers; staff being segregated from students and other staff with security doors; the number of steps at the university and the impact this would have on some people with a disability. One pleasing and unexpected outcome of the psychogeography exercise was the level of energy and collegiality it generated. The exercise was conducted at an early stage in an eight-month career development program and its use heightened participant’s awareness of aspects of their work environment’s impact on career success that may have otherwise remained uncovered or unexamined. Our view is that psychogeography; within a limited timeframe is a valuable method to employ. When the data from such a method is captured though a focus group the impost on participant’ times is lessened, the quality of data is retained with the combined research method producing novel findings that may be different to other more traditional qualitative research methods. In our case, they helped uncover aspects of university culture and enculturation to which many research participants had been previously oblivious.",2017,05/,Electronic Journal of Business Research Methods,15,2,99-108,,,,#838,Wardale 2017,"",""

International experience and imitation of location choices: The role of experience interpretation and assessment and its board-level microfoundations,"Spadafora, E.; Giachetti, C.; Kumodzie-Dussey, M.K.; Elango, B.","Research summaryDrawing on the information-based imitation and information-processing perspectives, we examine how experience interpretation and assessment-and in particular its board-level microfoundations-affects the relationship between a firm's international experience and its decision to imitate the market leader's location choices. Our results show that the negative relationship between international experience and imitation of location choices is positively moderated by board turnover, board age, and board equity ownership but not influenced by board gender diversity. These findings advance our understanding of the interplay between information-based motives for imitation and firms' information processing and organizational learning. Specifically, we contribute to research on the effect of international experience on firms' mimetic behavior by pointing out the relevance of experience interpretation and assessment from a microfoundations perspective.Managerial summaryOur study provides indications for executives attempting to predict competitors' global strategy. When it comes to location choices, we find that companies with less international experience are more likely to follow the market leader, while those internationally experienced are more likely to follow their own path. Moreover, lower board turnover, relatively younger directors, and smaller equity ownership can favor the articulation and exploitation of the lessons offered by prior international experiences, thus further reducing the company's inclination to imitate the leader's location choices. Firms seeking an independent path toward internationalization can therefore use corporate governance-and in particular board-level factors-to enhance their ability to interpret and assess their international experience. © 2023 Strategic Management Society.",2023,/,Global Strategy Journal,,,111-46,,10.1002/gsj.1428,,#841,Spadafora 2023,"",""
Influence of the entrepreneur's personal values in business governance style and their relationship with happiness at work,"Foncubierta-rodriguez, M.-J.","Purpose Happiness management is receiving increasing attention in business, and this is reflected in the literature. But any business management option has to be grounded in a true awareness or belief that it will be a suitable and appropriate choice. In this belief the personal values of those who have the power to lead the way to weigh heavily. In this sense, there are personal values that, when used as guidelines in the management of a company, seem to promote the happiness of employees in the work environment. The purpose of this paper is to find the personal values of the entrepreneur. As a secondary objective, the authors also study whether these values are associated with certain entrepreneurs' socio-demographic factors (gender and age). Design/methodology/approach The group to be studied is the Spanish business community. An exploratory study is carried out, first, with the definition of value constructs according to Schwartz's personal values model and, second, with a relational analysis, measuring association effects through logistic regression. Findings Two higher-order personal values of the entrepreneur are found that seem to contain all the elements that would lead to management styles that would facilitate happiness at work. These values emerge from a dimension model of Schwartz's theory of basic human values. MVP which, however, does not follow its four adjacent/antagonistic dimensions, but is composed of three dimensions adjacent to each other and, therefore, complementary. Moreover, some stereotypes in the literature on the relationships between personal values and certain socio-demographic factors are broken down and their effects on happiness at work are revealed. Research limitations/implications One of the limitations of this work is the relatively small sample size. In this sense, it would be useful to check whether the overall results are repeated in larger samples. Another limitation is that this is a portrait of the group at a given time. Given the experimental nature of this type of work, especially in the case of socio-demographic factors, it would be advisable to carry out a follow-up longitudinal analysis with a time horizon. This would allow a more precise investigation of the effects of the variables mentioned above. In addition, a third limitation is that the authors are studying the collective of Spanish entrepreneurs, and in the study of personal values, culture has a determining influence (Schenck, 2016; Boer and Boehnke, 2016; Perozo and Paz, 2016). It would also be worthwhile considering this study by sector: are the values the same for entrepreneurs in different sectors?; or in some specific sectors, for example, are there differences between entrepreneurs with tech businesses versus non-tech businesses or those who make the circular economy or the green economy a guideline for their organizations? Thus, technology companies must be open to change. Openness and innovation are for their entrepreneurs' key values to ensure their performance (Tseng, 2010; Van Auken et al., 2008). However, in these organizations, there is a framework of conflicting values between the required flexibility and the values of power and control that the entrepreneur needs, and wants, to have (Albarraci´n et al., 2014). On the other hand, personal values determine green self-identity and moderate its relationships with ecological care and the moral obligation of the entrepreneur (Blankenberg and Alhusen, 2019; Barbarossa et al., 2017). Therefore, it could be analysed whether these values are maintained in entrepreneurs in these sectors, influencing, as discussed in this paper, greater happiness in the work context; and whether they are conditioned by gender or age (Fotieva, 2021; Li et al., 2020). It would also be helpful to study the socio-demographic influence further, to analyse the possibility of interaction or confounding effects between socio-demographic variables and some other variables not addressed in this paper. For example, does purchasing power or income level, affect personal values? And do the values that give content to F2, power and control, lead the entrepreneur to a higher level of income level or vice versa? Do other factors play a role? In fact, for Hirigoyen (2008), values such as altruism, benevolence and universalism are considered as obstacles to the development of the company. Subsequently, authors such as Salas-Vallina (2018) and Boubakary (2015) conclude that far from that idea, these axiological elements would lead to more significant business development through the satisfaction and happiness they generate in employees and stimulate their productivity, matching with the conclusions. It would be interesting, as a complement to the approach of this work, to carry out a study on the happiness at work of the entrepreneur's employees, being the group of employees surveyed. Knowing the profile of values of an entrepreneur through the scale proposed in this work, it would be possible to analyse whether this is associated with greater or lesser perceived happiness among his/her employees. As mentioned above, from the methodological point of view, a risk of using the multidimensional scaling modelling for the analysis of personal values is that the respondent reflects more what he/she considers socially desirable than his/her true perception. This bias is one of the main limitations of psychological research. However, the fact that European Statistical Office surveys are guided by experts, both in processing -knowing how to deal with social desirability in personal values research (Danioni and Barni, 2020) - and in data collection, eliminates this limitation.",2022,/,Corporate Governance: The International Journal of Business in Society,22,3,592-617,,10.1108/CG-05-2021-0197,,#842,Foncubierta-rodriguez 2022,"",""
Female underrepresentation in project-based organizations exposes organizational isomorphism,"Baker, M.; French, E.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the structural career barriers in project-based construction and property development organizations in Australia, and explore how these affect women and their project careers. It applies the insights of the institutional theory to explain how the process of normative isomorphism continues to reproduce female underrepresentation in those organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on an exploratory interpretive approach, this study consisted of 16 in-depth interviews with female project managers from the Australian construction and property industry. Findings - The research shows that organizational practices may contribute to the ongoing female underrepresentation in the Australian construction and property development industries. The structural career barriers unique to project organizations include work practice, presenteeism, reliance on career self-management and the “filtering of personnel” in recruitment and promotion practices.

Leveraging organizational performance via knowledge management systems platforms in emerging economies: Evidence from the Egyptian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry,"Shehata, G.M.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of adopting knowledge management systems (KMSs) on firms’ performance. Although many organizations have adopted the notion of KMS, there is little evidence on the effect of KMS on a firm’s performance, especially in an emerging economy like the Egyptian one. An intensive literature review is conducted not only to synthesize but also to establish the conceptual foundations for the systemic perspective of knowledge management and its potential impact on knowledge management performance in an emerging information and communication technology (ICT) industry. This systemic perspective fits with the evolutionary nature of such an emerging industry in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study of this work is conducted on knowledge-intensive firms operating in the field of ICT. The paper is descriptive in nature where a quantitative research design is adopted to survey senior managers’ perceptions – from both national and multinational enterprises operating in Egypt – on the pay-off maintained from creating an integrative KMS. The primary data are collected from 90 managers holding significant top positions related to the knowledge management area. A linear simple regression test is conducted to discover the initial association between the conceptual model’s key variables. Findings – The results of this work reveal that there is a positive association between each of the six elements that constitute a KMS, namely, knowledge: creation, acquisition, codification, sharing, transfer and measurement, and the perceived knowledge management performance. Besides, there is a significant positive association between the adopted total KMS and perceived knowledge management performance. This study provides strong evidence that KMSs are essential to improve firms’ performance. The results of t-test and analysis of variance assert that the gender, types of business, year of experience and age of respondents have no significant difference to perceived knowledge management performance resulting from KMS. Research limitations/implications – The findings reflect the fact that informants have to deploy six components that constitute a KMS to realize improvements in knowledge management performance. This work also highlights a number of findings of great value to managers in the ICT sector. Yet, the empirical study does not cover all the issues which are linked to KMS implementation. Issues such as culture, trust and leadership role in building a significant KMS are not examined in this work. Also, the generalizability of the findings to other industries must be considered carefully. Although the findings are statistically significant, the framework developed may be quite specific to the ICT organizations. Practical implications – This paper enhances managers’ understanding in deploying the notion of KMSs to leverage their corporate performance. It also provides managers in emerging markets with an integrative perspective to fundamental issues that encounter them when they put those KMSs into practice. Social implications – This research advances understanding of the application and benefit of KMS in ICT firms in several ways: it provides a better understanding of KMS and practices currently being applied in the Egyptian ICT firms. There had been little or no industry-wide empirical research on this topic to date, it provides a better understanding of knowledge processes in the ICT sector; specifically, the links between knowledge acquisition, creation, codification, sharing, transfer and measurement, and their links to performance, the measurement instruments developed for this research constitute a reliable set of construct measures that provide a basis for future research. Originality/value – This paper advances the knowledge management subject by synthesizing past studies into an integrative KMS that directs scholars’ attention on how to examine the notion. It is claimed that KMS help those managers improve core business processes, management decisions and, accordingly, firms’ performance. Besides, this study suggests a set of implications for managers in an emerging market that has recently adopted the notion of KMSs. This study also reflects the viewpoints and perceptions of key managers in a strongly evolving knowledge-intensive industry that has an increasing impact on the GDP of an entire nation throughout the past two decades.",2015,/,VINE,45,2,239-78,,10.1108/VINE-06-2014-0045,,#844,Shehata 2015,"",""
"It's Not What You Say, But How You Sound: CEO Vocal Masculinity and the Board's Early-Stage CEO Compensation Decisions","Nair, K.; Haque, W.; Sauerwald, S.","Growing research in evolutionary psychology suggests that having a deep, masculine voice is beneficial to males in leadership positions because it signals physical strength. However, how this phenomenon plays out at the top of the modern organization is not clearly understood. We posit that CEO vocal masculinity positively influences early-stage CEO compensation for male CEOs by biasing directors' perceptions of CEO quality. Challenging the pervasive notion that evolved biases are deterministic, we also examine how environmental conditions (i.e., industry competitiveness) and audience characteristics (i.e., female representation on the compensation committee) moderate the effect of CEO vocal masculinity. Longitudinal analyses on a unique dataset consisting of interviews and speeches of male CEOs from publicly listed UK firms provide support for our hypothesized predictions.

Sparse network embedding for community detection and sign prediction in signed social networks,"Hu, Baofang; Wang, Hong; Yu, Xiaomei; Yuan, Weihua; He, Tianwen","Network embedding is an important pre-process for analysing large scale information networks. Several network embedding algorithms have been proposed for unsigned social networks. However, these methods cannot be simply migrate to signed social networks which have both positive and negative relationships. In this paper, we present our signed social network embedding model which is based on the word embedding model. To deal with two kinds of links, we define two relationships: neighbour relationship and common neighbour relationship, as well as design a bias random walk procedure. In order to further improve interpretation of the representation vectors, the follow-proximally-regularized-leader online learning algorithm is introduced to the traditional word embedding framework to acquire sparse representations. Extensive experiments were carried out to compare our algorithm with three state-of-the-art methods for community detection and sign prediction tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than the comparison algorithms on most signed social networks. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019,,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,10,1,175-186,,10.1007/s12652-017-0630-1,,#846,Hu 2019,"",""
Mixed-gender ownership and financial performance of SMEs in South Africa: a multidisciplinary analysis,"Kengne, B.D.S.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the presence of women among owner-stakeholders affects firms’ financial performance. Particularly, it extends the corporate governance literature by linking stakeholder theory and gender differences to explain why gender composition of ownership matters for firms’ performance. As the management of small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) revolves around owner-managers and their individual characteristics that are likely to affect their achievements, the study further investigates the relationship between the gender composition of ownership and the firm survival. Design/methodology/approach - Using survey data on SMEs for 2007 and 2010, this study uses a panel-level heteroskedasticity technique and a probit methodology to assess the effect women’s presence among owners may exert on SMEs performance and survival, respectively. Findings - Results indicate that firms jointly owned by men and women appear to perform better than those owned by men although the presence of women among owners does not correlate with firm survival. Research limitations/implications - While the findings of this study shed some light on the performance impact of gender composition of firm ownership, reports based on the presence of women among owners may not present the full picture. Whether the ownership is shared equally between different genders might provide further insides on the magnitude and/or robustness of such effect. Moreover, a small sample period (T = 2) was used to analyse a single industrial sector (manufacturing), and even though the Hausman test confirmed the use of random-effects specification, caution should be taken when generalizing the findings to other cases. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the leadership in mixed-gender context propels a perspective of women as a valuable resource within SMEs, but relying on it to sustain the survival would be unwise. Social implications - South Africa scores particularly high on positive actions towards women entrepreneurship, and this is compounded in the SMEs sector by managerial attitudes that could offer positive developments for women. Originality/value - The positive and significant relationship between women’s presence among owners and SMEs financial performance in South Africa complements the almost exclusively reported negative impact of gender diversity on firm performance. Consequently, mixed-gender owners’ team can be used as a fulcrum to promote SMEs growth in South Africa.",2016,/,International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship,8,2,117-36,,10.1108/IJGE-10-2014-0040,,#847,Kengne 2016,"",""
The relationship between demographic factors and managers’ perception of unethical tone at the top,"Lasakova, A.; Remisova, A.","Purpose - Unethical tone at the top (UTAT) carries a lot of risks and unsolicited results for both the people and companies. The purpose of this paper is to uncover the systematic differences in managers’ perception of UTAT based on their demographic characteristics, and subsequently to specify some useful recommendations to inform how companies can assist in increasing managers’ sensitivity to the harmful top-down practices and thus support ethicality in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach - Eight demographic factors that, based on prior findings from the literature, might play a role in varying perception of UTAT were examined on data from 772 management professionals working in diverse industries. The Kruskal-Wallis test statistics was utilised to infer significant differences in perceptions of UTAT among managers. Findings - Findings suggest that male managers tended to perceive UTAT as significantly less harmful than did their female counterparts. Similarly, top managers inclined to perceive UTAT as less detrimental than the middle and line management levels. Managers with higher tenure (10± years of managerial experience) perceived UTAT as more detrimental in contributing to unethical leadership decisions and workplace culture. Respondents who have studied business-oriented programs perceived UTAT to be less harmful for the company than the non-business students. Interestingly, age, level of education, span of control and even the ethics training received during career were all found to be not relevant in this respect. Originality/value - Based on solid empirical findings this study fills the gap in literature on the tone at the top and helps in understanding what can be done in organisational practice to improve managers’ awareness of the damaging effects of UTAT and thus to minimise threats to an ethical workplace culture.",2019,/,Journal of Management Development,38,1,25-45,,10.1108/JMD-07-2018-0213,,#848,Lasakova 2019,"",""
Why Trump and Clinton won and lost: the roles of hypermasculinity and androgyny,"Powell, G.N.; Butterfield, D.A.; Xueting Jiang","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine perceptions of the “Ideal President” (IP) and presidential candidates in the 2016 US presidential election in relation to gender stereotypes and leader prototypes. Design/methodology/approach - In all, 378 business students assessed perceptions of either the IP or a particular candidate on measures of masculinity and femininity. Androgyny (balance of masculinity and femininity) and hypermasculinity (extremely high masculinity) scores were calculated from these measures. Findings - The IP was perceived as higher in masculinity than femininity, but less similar to the male (Donald Trump) than the female (Hillary Clinton) candidate. IP perceptions were more androgynous than in the 2008 US presidential election. Respondents’ political preferences were related to their IP perceptions on hypermasculinity, which in turn were consistent with perceptions of their preferred candidate. Social implications - Trump’s high hypermasculinity scores may explain why he won the electoral college vote, whereas Clinton’s being perceived as more similar to the IP, and IP perceptions’ becoming more androgynous over time, may explain why she won the popular vote. Originality/value - The study extends the literature on the linkages between gender stereotypes and leader prototypes in two respects. Contrary to the general assumption of a shared leader prototype, it demonstrates the existence of different leader prototypes according to political preference. The hypermasculinity construct, which was introduced to interpret leader prototypes in light of Trump’s candidacy and election, represents a valuable addition to the literature with potentially greater explanatory power than masculinity in some situations.",2018,/,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",37,1,44-62,,10.1108/EDI-08-2017-0166,,#849,Powell 2018,"",""
Innovation by foreign researchers: relative influences of internal versus external human capital,"Goel, R.K.; Goktepe-Hulten, D.","Innovation productivity of expatriate researchers and human capital that empowers them is an important issue; however, with a scarcity of relevant data, formal empirical evidence has been limited. This paper uses a rich dataset of foreign researchers at a leading German research institution to study the drivers of their innovation productivity (measured by patents and invention disclosures). Another contribution is that we examine the relative effectiveness of internal (institution-specific) and external human capital. These findings are compared to the behavior of native researchers. Results, based on a survey sample of nearly 1000 foreign researchers and taking account of the interdependence between invention disclosures and patenting, show that internal administrative leadership positions (especially group leaders) enhanced propensities to innovate, while purely academic positions (professor or guest researcher) did not positively impact innovation. With regard to external human capital, foreign researchers who were business owners or nascent entrepreneurs were more likely to innovate. Internal (institutional) experience mattered more than industry experience. Doctoral degrees seemed relatively more effective for patenting than for invention disclosures. No significant gender differences in innovation productivity were found. In contrast, while many of the influences were similar for domestic researchers, they experienced positive innovation spillovers from being directors, but domestic female researchers faced special innovation challenges. Finally, domestic professors, unlike foreign professors, did not experience negative tendencies towards innovation.",2021,02/,Journal of Technology Transfer,46,1,258-76,,10.1007/s10961-019-09771-8,,#850,Goel 2021,"",""
Board experiential diversity and corporate radical innovation,"Genin, A.; Ma, W.; Bhagwat, V.; Bernile, G.","Research SummaryHow does board experiential diversity affect corporate radical innovation? We find that the combined diversity of directors' educational, industrial, and organizational experiences spurs the quantity and quality of path-breaking patents developed at a firm. Instrumental variable analysis leveraging exogenous variation in firm access to the nonlocal supply of directors with diverse experiences indicates causality, which is corroborated by difference-in-differences tests. Firm heterogeneity suggests experientially diverse directors spur radical innovation by better serving the firm's advisory needs rather than via improved governance. Our findings enrich theoretical insights into how corporate board leadership may affect innovation and long-term value creation at the firm.Managerial SummaryThis study offers practical guidance on director recruitment. Board directors with diverse educational, industrial, and organizational experiences can support the invention of radical technology. This type of innovation can create substantial economic and social value. Noting the benefits of diverse experiences in the boardroom, corporate executives can search beyond the traditional director pedigree (e.g., Ivy League-educated financiers), where female and minority individuals remain underrepresented. In doing so, the firm can find more qualified candidates to assemble a demographically and intellectually diverse board, thus cultivating an inclusive corporate culture conducive to shareholder and stakeholder value creation. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2023,/,Strategic Management Journal,,,2634-57,,10.1002/smj.3499,,#851,Genin 2023,"",""
"Open-plan office, employees’ enactment, interpretations and reactions to territoriality","Monaghan, N.; Ayoko, O.B.","Purpose - Research on the physical work environment and employee territorial behavior in the field of organizational behavior is limited. In particular, while the prevalence of territorial behaviors in organizations is not new, little is known about how the physical work environment (e.g. open-plan offices) may influence the enactment, interpretation and reactions to territoriality. The purpose of this paper is to explore the connection between the physical environment of work (e.g. open-plan office), employee territorial behaviors (including infringement) and affective environment. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by means of in-depth-interviews from 27 participants from two large Australian public organizations involved in recruitment, marketing, consulting and education. Findings - Results revealed that employees’ personalization in the open-plan office is driven by the nature of their tasks, appointment, duration of time spent on their desk, level of adaptation to the open-plan office configurations and the proximity of desks to senior managers, hallways and passers-by. Additionally, affective environment has a critical effect on employee personalization and the enactment and perception of territoriality and infringements in open-plan offices. Additionally, the authors found that the affective environment is dynamic and that employees in open-plan offices experienced emotional contagion (positive and negative). Research limitations/implications - Due to the demographic make-up of one of the participating organizations, less than a third of participants were male. While the data did not suggest any disparity in the territorial behaviors of male and female, future research should include an even representation of male and female participants. Similarly, the authors did not examine the impact of ethnicity and cultural background on employees’ territoriality. However, given that the workforce is increasingly becoming multicultural, future research should explore how ethnicity might impact the use of space, work processes and productivity in open-plan office. Additionally, scholars should continue to tease out the impact of affective environment (positive and negative) on team processes (e.g. conflict, communication, collaboration and the development of team mental models) in the open-plan office. Practical implications - The results indicate some practical implications. Noise and distraction are indicated in the results. Therefore, human resource managers and organizational leaders should work with employees to develop some ground rules and norms to curb excessive noise in the open-plan office. Additionally, the authors found in the current study that the affective environment is dynamic and that employees in open-plan offices experienced emotional contagion (positive and negative). Managers should watch out for how individuals react to the prevailing emotions and moods in the open-plan office with the intention of diffusing negative emotions as quickly as possible, for example, by changing the topic under discussion in the open-plan office. The results speak to the need for more active collaboration and engagement between policy makers, workspace architects, designers and employees especially prior to the building of such workspaces. Social implications - The results suggest that effective employee interactions in open-plan office may be enhanced by positive emotional contagion and office affective environment. Originality/value - So far, little is known about the impact of the physical work context (e.g. open-plan offices) on the enactment, interpretation and reactions to territoriality. The current paper explores the connection between the physical environment of work (e.g. open-plan office), employee territorial behaviors (including infringement) and affective environment. The findings demonstrate for the first time and especially in an open-plan office that ownership and personalization of objects and workspaces are more likely to be driven by the amount of time spent at one’s desk, the nature of employees’ appointments and tasks. Additionally, the present research is one of the first to report on affective environment dynamism in the open-plan office.",2019,/,International Journal of Manpower,40,2,228-45,,10.1108/IJM-10-2017-0270,,#852,Monaghan 2019,"",""

Design/methodology/approach A global online survey, involving over 34,000 respondents, indicated, from a list of 14 possibilities, the role model category from whom they learned to lead. Respondents indicated their age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, educational level, hierarchical level and job function. Chi-square analysis was used to identify how these factors may have affected the choice of role models distribution. Findings Family member (parents, siblings and other family outside of the immediate family) was found to be the most important role model category when it came to learning how to lead. Ranked second was immediate supervisor/manager. The rank order in terms of frequency of role model choices was not substantially different across demographic characteristics, though there were statistically significant differences regarding the relative importance of the various role model categories by demographics.

Let’s talk about TEX—Understanding consumer preferences for smart interactive textile products using a conjoint analysis approach,"Offermann-Van Heek, Julia; Brauner, Philipp; Ziefle, Martina","Interactive textiles are reaching maturity. First technology augmented textiles in form of clothes and furnitures are becoming commercially available. In contrast to the close link between technological development and innovations, future users’ acceptance and usage of such interactive textiles has not been integrated sufficiently, yet. The current study investigates future users’ consumer behavior and acceptance of interactive textiles using a scenario-based conjoint analysis study, which was presented in an online questionnaire (n = 324). Two prototypical interactive textiles were focused on: a smart jacket and a smart armchair. To assess the textile products, the participants had to choose the preferred product alternative consisting each of the acceptance-relevant factors ""connectivity"", ""input modality"", ""feature range"", ""usability"", and ""ease of cleaning""and their respective levels. The results revealed that the ""ease of cleaning"" is the most important decision criterion for both textile devices (even more important for the smart jacket), followed by ""feature range"", ""connectivity"", and ""usability"". In contrast, the ""input modality"" is perceived as least important. The study also identified user profiles based on the projected consumer behavior (""adopters"", ""rejecters"", and ""undecided"") for both products. Besides the differences in product evaluation and projected consumer behavior, the user groups are significantly influenced by the individual affinity to textiles (both products) and gender (smart jacket).

Responses unveiled how macro- and microaggressions impede career pathways to leadership positions and, therefore, representation. We identify ways in which socio-hydrology can benefit from a representation justice lens by considering the following: (1) how power and politics shape the composition of the water sector and decision-making processes; (2) how available quantitative data do not account for lived experiences of individuals in the water sector; and (3) how intersectionality cannot easily be accounted for in current socio-hydrological models.

This study aims to: A) identify clinician expectations and factors that influence EMR acceptance; B) evaluate perceived usability, technology proficiency and satisfaction; and C) assess the impact of EMR big bang implementation on allied health workflows at three Australian tertiary hospitals. Methods Repeated measures study pre and six-months post EMR implementation. User acceptance was evaluated with online surveys: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (pre), System Usability Scale and open-ended questions (post). A four-hour time-motion study evaluated changes in allied health inpatient workflows. Results Surveys were completed by 224 allied health clinicians (47% response rate) pre, and 196 (41%) post-implementation. Pre-implementation, 96% of respondents felt using the EMR was a good idea and they would find it useful. Six-months post-implementation 88% liked interacting with the EMR. 64% found it easy to use and most didn't require technical support (78%). While 68% of participants felt very confident, 51% believed they were not using the EMR's full potential. Post-implementation half of participants agreed significant upskilling was required and that EMR workflows were not quick to learn.

Competencies of quality professionals in the era of industry 4.0: a case study of electronics manufacturer from Malaysia,"Kannan, K.S.P.N.; Garad, A.","Purpose - This study investigates the competencies required for quality management professionals to meet the needs of industry 4.0. The authors use a case study strategy at an electronics manufacturer in southern Malaysia, to adapt their role to be relevant in the industry 4.0 environment. In doing so, this study answers the following four questions: (1) How are the changing technological trends expected to impact the future role of quality in industry 4.0? (2) What are the competencies gap between current and future roles of quality professionals? (3) What are the views and practices related to quality roles? (4) How can the gaps identified be closed to meet the quality challenges of industry 4.0? Design/methodology/approach - The research methods consist of a comprehensive review of literature on the technological trends towards industry 4.0 and the impact on the role of quality and competence that may be required in the future, as well as internal document review on the current roles of quality professionals in an electronics manufacturer in southern Malaysia, to identify the competence gap. Empirical data was collected based on surveys conducted on 64 quality professionals with a response rate of 96.88%. Interviews were conducted on three decision-makers from critical areas in the electronics manufacturer for viewpoints from three different perspectives: finance, operations and talent development. Findings - Quality professionals will require technical competencies to interpret large amounts of data from processes to make strategic decisions, the use of new AR tools and be aware of data security risks. Methodological competencies will be required to use data to identify the source of problems, to access reliable sources of learning and the ability to use new tools for solving complex problems efficiently. Social competencies will be required in communications across multi-sites, suppliers and customers in new collaborative virtual platforms, with the ability to retain tacit and explicit knowledge, in a decentralized environment that will require leadership ability to make decisions. Personal competencies required will be the ability to work in a flexible workplace and time and more frequent work-related changes. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of the study is based on what the authors currently know of the future, which may not be much for the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer, who have not been exposed much to the technology yet. The potential for the future landscape to change dramatically with rapid technology changes may also result in a different set of skills for future quality professionals. The quality professionals who were involved in this study were the quality executives, engineers and managers, irrespective of their gender, age, length of service and experience in the field of quality. Therefore, these variables were not taken into consideration for this research. Practical implications - This research helped to identify the role of quality in industry 4.0 and key competencies that the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer will require to adapt to their role in industry 4.0. However, based on the questionnaire and the interview comments of key personnel, it can be concluded that quality professionals lack awareness of their new roles in industry 4.0. This could be due to the fact that the new technology is not implemented by quality professionals but by the innovation team based in Singapore headquarters, as was also advised by the operations head. Social implications - The benefit of industry 4.0 technology is clearly shown by Philips's new Dutch factory with robotized technology that was able to produce the same output with one-tenth of the workers of its China factory (Rifkin, 2014, chapter 8). Rojko (2017, p. 80) also shared a similar view that industry 4.0 is expected to reduce production costs by 10-30%, logistics costs by 10-30% and quality management costs by 10-20%. The importance of this research can be seen from the findings of ""The Future of Jobs"" (2018, p. 22), which suggests that the window of opportunity for organizations to leverage the new technology to re-skill is within the period of 2018-2022, in order to enable employees to reach full potential in the high value-added tasks. The electronics manufacturer may need to keep to this timeline to maintain its competitive advantage. Originality/value - The purpose of this paper was to determine the competence gap of current quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer with the competencies required in industry 4.0. This led to the third objective, to identify the views of stakeholders based on the propositions derived from the gaps identified, to triangulate the findings, to conclude the competency gaps of the current quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer. Finally, the objective of this paper was to make a recommendation on how to prepare the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer for their role in industry 4.0. The research identified the technical, methodological, social and personal competencies gap of the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer by looking at the changes expected in industry 4.0 from four aspects, factory (people and process), business, product and customers.",2021,/,International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management,,,839-71,,10.1108/IJQRM-04-2019-0124,,#858,Kannan 2021,"",""
Exploring the Relationship between Top Management Team Characteristics and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis,"Habek, P.; Saeed, F.","In the evolving landscape of corporate governance, the role of Top Management Teams (TMTs) has transcended traditional decision-making paradigms, becoming integral to the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

This study employs a literature review and bibliometric analysis of the existing literature up to 2023, utilizing the Scopus database to discern trends and patterns in the TMT-CSR relationship. Findings reveal that TMT characteristics, including diversity in gender, age, and professional background, significantly influence CSR strategies, enhancing organizations' responsiveness to stakeholder needs. Notably, diverse TMTs demonstrate a greater capacity for developing comprehensive CSR initiatives, particularly when led by executives committed to sustainability and ethical practices. The analysis indicates a growing scholarly interest in this intersection, with a marked increase in publications over the past decade, highlighting the strategic importance of TMTs in shaping CSR outcomes.

The number of 30CST repetitions and the stopwatch-based TUG duration were recorded. Instrumented features were computed from the smartphone embedded inertial sensors. Four logistic regression models were fitted and the Areas Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) were calculated and compared using the DeLong test. Standard clinical and instrumented measures of 30CST both showed equal moderate discriminative ability of 0.68 (95%CI 0.60-0.76), p = 0.97. Similarly, for TUG: AUC was 0.68 (95%CI 0.60-0.77) and 0.65 (95%CI 0.56-0.73), respectively, p = 0.26.

Are hybrid sit–stand postures a good compromise between sitting and standing?,"Noguchi, M.; Glinka, M.; Mayberry, G.R.; Noguchi, K.; Callaghan, J.P.","Potential alternatives for conventional sitting and standing postures are hybrid sit-stand postures (i.e. perching). The purposes of this study were (i) to identify where lumbopelvic and pelvic angles deviate from sitting and standing and (ii) to use these breakpoints to define three distinct postural phases: sitting, perching, and standing, in order to examine differences in muscle activations and ground reaction forces between phases. Twenty-four participants completed 19 1-min static trials, from sitting (90°) to standing (180°), sequentially in 5°trunk–thigh angle increments. The perching phase was determined to be 145–175° for males and 160–175° for females. For both sexes, knee extensor activity was lower in standing compared to perching or sitting (p p < .001), requiring ∼15% of body-weight.

Would diversified corporate boards add value? The case of banking institutions in Malaysia,"Jubilee, R.V.W.; Khong, R.W.L.; Woan Ting Hung","Purpose - Board diversity has gained increasing attention and has been widely posited as a driver for firm value. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the relation of gender diversity of corporate boards with the value of banking institutions in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprised of ten banking institutions listed on Bursa Malaysia with data observations from 2007 to 2016. Panel data techniques were employed to investigate the relationship between having female directors and firm performance in terms of values generated as indicated by Tobin’s Q. Findings - The results revealed a positive relationship between the proportion of female director and the value of the bank. Interestingly, this study found that appointment of female independent directors tends to be negatively related to the value of such institutions. Practical implications - There remains a shortage of research studying the impact of gender equality on corporate boards in Malaysia generally and in the banking sector specifically. Thus, this study contributes a significant knowledge on the value implication of board diversity. The findings also provide useful insights on the developmental policy initiated by the government to increase female participation in the top management.

Carbon capability of urban residents and its structure: Evidence from a survey of Jiangsu Province in China,Jia Wei; Hong Chen; Xiaotong Cui; Ruyin Long,"With the improvement in people’s living standards, emission reductions in consumption have become more significant. Accordingly, we defined the concept of the carbon capability of urban residents. We analyzed in depth the generation mechanism and evolution process of capability and further constructed an advanced five-dimensional model of carbon capability that embodies carbon values, carbon identification capability, carbon choice capability, carbon action capability, and carbon influence capability. We also proposed and gave a clear explanation of the connotations of the multi-layered levels of carbon capability, which include the threshold level, shaping level, effective level, maturity level, and leadership level. Based on our survey of 890 urban residents in Jiangsu Province, we statistically analyzed the current situation of urban residents’ carbon capability and the differences in the social demographic variables. The results indicate that carbon identification capability and carbon influence capability are the main segments hindering carbon capability, the detection rate of inferior value is almost 50%, and there is an obvious “multi-layered gap” phenomenon that is evident from carbon values to carbon influence capability. With the upgrading of education that has occurred, carbon values, carbon identification capability, and carbon selection capability have all been strengthened gradually and the gap between carbon identification capability and carbon values is getting larger, but the gap between carbon action capability and carbon identification capability shows a U-shaped variation trend. With the increase in income levels, the gap between carbon action capability and carbon choice capability shows an inverted U-shaped variation trend. Except for carbon identification capability, the mean values of the capability of men are all lower than those of women as well as the gap between carbon action capability and carbon choice capability. This study provided a guide for policy from the viewpoint of achieving a sustainable improvement in urban residents’ carbon capability.

Understanding labor conflicts in Chinese manufacturing: a Yin-Yang harmony perspective,Tachia Chin; Ren-huai Liu,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to employ a Yin-Yang harmony perspective to propose a novel circled 5C model to understand the unique harmonizing process of how conflicts are resolved in China. Despite increasing research on labor conflicts in Chinese manufacturing, Western theories still can not explain how Chinese culture influences conflict management. Design/methodology/approach – The authors investigate a large manufacturer where a severe labor strike happened in South China. A mixed-methods research design is adopted. The scale of Chinese harmony and analysis of variance are used to identify the underlying unharmonious factors triggering the labor strike. The grounding theory approach (a case study) was adopted to further examine the proposed 5C model. Findings – “Harmony with corporate system”, “Harmony between departments” and “Harmony with firm leader” were found to arouse employee grievances the most. Differences in age, gender, marital status, educational level, tenure and position were discovered to affect workers’ perceptions of workplace harmony. The proposed 5C model was supported. Practical implications – As a lesson in handling escalating labor conflicts, this study allows foreign investors to better understand how to cope with relevant labor strife issues in China. In addition, this project integrates research with consultancy service, which can be seen as an exciting step forward in bridging academics and practitioners. Originality/value – Based on Yin-Yang harmony thinking, this study suggests an integrative, context-specific concern – concern for harmony for China to transcend the Western dual-concern model regarding the choice of coping with conflicts.

Competency based superior performance and organizational effectiveness,"Shet, S.V.; Patil, S.V.; Chandawarkar, M.R.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between competency-based performance management and organizational effectiveness (OE). It signifies the importance of developing competency-based performance concept in organizations. Since conventional performance management systems (PMSs) are diminishing and as organizations are looking for breakthrough PMSs, this research attempted to fill the gap from stakeholder’s perspective - employee, manager and organization in devising new approach in PMS. Design/methodology/approach - The research design involved developing scale for “competency-based superior performance” and validating scale for “organizational effectiveness,” The data for this survey are collected from 292 respondents through structured questionnaire. Hypotheses depicting aforementioned relationships were empirically tested in the context of competency-based performance practices in organizations based in India.

Learning to lead from outsiders: The value of career communities as a source of external peer coaching,"Kotlyar, I.; Richardson, J.; Karakowsky, L.","Purpose – An increasingly popular method of facilitating employee and leadership development is via a career community (Parker et al., 2004), where individuals self-organize to obtain career support. This study was driven by the following research question: how do external peer coaching groups – which are a form of career community – impact leadership development? The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of a research study that examined one such career community focussed on providing peer coaching for managers in business organizations. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with participants who attended a leadership development program that was based on harnessing a career community for the purpose of peer coaching. The authors report the results of the study and its implications for leadership development programs. Design/methodology/approach – The authors chose a qualitative methodology to conduct this exploratory examination, where the authors conducted in-depth interviews with participants in a unique leadership development program which involved peer group coaching supplemented by one-on-one personal coaching. A key reason for adopting a qualitative methodology was that the authors were looking for a deeper understanding of interviewees’ perceptions and experiences regarding peer coaching. The first component of the leadership program involved eight peer coaching sessions over a 12-month period. Participants met in small, exclusive groups – typically in cohorts of seven to eight peers, but as many as 12 peers – every six weeks to discuss a variety of topics relevant to their jobs and stage of career and to provide each other with peer coaching and advice. Each group was comprised of people from different organizations. Sessions were led by a facilitator and lasted three hours each. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 17 graduates of the program. The sample comprised 14 women and three men. Interviews were audio taped and transcribed verbatim and then analyzed using thematic analysis (King, 2004) to identify the key themes in interviewees’ experiences of the respective program. Findings – Thematic interpretation of participants’ responses yielded the following four major themes: first, the value of a learning community; second, the utility of a formal approach to peer coaching; third, the value of diversity and “externality”; and fourth, the value of an open learning environment (each fully described in the manuscript). The study revealed that external peer coaching and personal coaching deliver distinct types of value as part of a complete leadership development program. Research limitations/implications – This was a case study and specific to one leadership development program. Consequently, the authors cannot necessarily generalize the findings. Practical implications – The findings draw critical attention to the major contribution that learning communities can make toward leadership development. Although many leadership development programs assume that “leadership” is best learned from top leaders (e.g. Presidents and CEOs), organizations can acquire unique benefits by leveraging the concept of peer coaching, which can produce substantial results by having managers at the same organizational level learn from each other. In addition, the study underscores the potential value of external sources of peer coaching and leader development. Organizations may further maximize such benefits by sending their mid and senior-level managers to external peer coaching programs, which can deliver unique value in addition to any internal leadership development initiatives. Social implications – This study underscores the need to better bridge the gap between two literatures – careers and leadership development. Career scholars explore the activities involved in developing careers (e.g. career communities) and leadership development scholars explore activities involved in developing leaders. This study demonstrates the value of integrating knowledge from both these literatures to suggest that learning communities can impact leadership development in significant and positive ways. Originality/value – This study makes a novel contribution to the literature addressing leadership development. It draws attention to the use of career communities for leadership development – an issue which has largely been ignored. In addition, while much of the extant research has focussed on either academic or student participants, the study focussed on business professionals.

Influence of factors unrelated to environmental quality on occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings,"Schiavon, Stefano; Altomonte, Sergio","Occupant satisfaction in office buildings has been correlated to the indoor environmental quality of workspaces, but can also be influenced by factors distinct from conventional IEQ parameters such as building features, personal characteristics, and work-related variables. A previous study by the authors analyzed occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings on a subset of the Center for the Built Environment survey database featuring 21,477 responses from 144 buildings (65 LEED-rated). The data suggested that, when evaluated comprehensively, there is not a practically significant influence of LEED certification on occupant satisfaction. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact on users' satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings of factors unrelated to environmental quality, including consideration of office type, spatial layout, distance from window, building size, gender, age, type of work, time at workspace, and weekly working hours. The results show that such factors statistically significantly influence the difference in occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings, but the effect size of such variations is, for most, practically negligible. However, tendencies were found showing that LEED-rated buildings may be more effective in providing higher satisfaction in open spaces rather than in enclosed offices, in small rather than in large buildings, and to occupants having spent less than one year at their workspace rather than to users that have occupied their workplace for longer. The findings suggest that the positive value of LEED certification from the point of view of occupant satisfaction may tend to decrease with time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,,Building and Environment,77,,148-159,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.03.028,,#867,Schiavon 2014,"",""
"Fashion orientation, shopping mall environment, and patronage intentions","Michon, R.; Chebat, J.-C.; Hong Yu; Lemarie, L.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore female fashion shoppers’ perception and response to the mall environment. Specific objectives include a conceptual model of female fashion shoppers’ experience in a mall environment incorporating fashion orientation, store personality, shopping mall perception, shopping value, and patronage intentions. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical testing is done with a latent path structural equation model. Data collection was carried out in a firmly controlled mall intercept survey which produced 312 usable questionnaires. Findings – Results show that shoppers’ fashion orientation hypothesized to be a personality trait is not an antecedent to the perception of the mall environment. Instead, fashion orientation moderates the perception of product and service quality, hedonic shoppers’ response, and patronage intentions. The perceived mall personality has a focussed impact on the perception of product and service quality. The mall’s sophistication image influences the perception of product quality. On the other hand, the mall’s enthusiasm image atmosphere affects the perception of service quality. Perceptions of product and service quality are correlated and trigger positive hedonic and utilitarian shopping benefits. Research limitations/implications – Because findings from this study cannot be generalized to other situations, the research should be replicated to a variety of mall formats and shopper segments. Furthermore, other fashion-orientation factors (fashion leadership, fashion interest, and anti-fashion attitude) should be considered. However, along with model complexities, increased sample sizes are also required. Future studies may also include male shoppers to investigate differences in fashion motivation and mall shopping experience. Practical implications – It is concluded that the person-place congruency theory is confirmed and that the shoppers’ fashion orientation should be included in the set of segmentation variables. Shopping malls cannot be everything to everyone without risking diluting their image. Downtown urban malls have the opportunity to adopt a well-defined positioning in order to differentiate themselves. Large suburban malls should partition themselves to remove image ambiguities. Mall managers must primarily work on the “meaning” of the mall atmosphere rather “mood.” Fashion shoppers are task oriented. Mall managers should design malls to facilitate the shopping experience with highly functional designs, simple layout, and clear signage in support of wayfinding. Originality/value – Although fashion consumers have been studied from diverse perspectives, there is limited research on the experience of fashion shoppers in a mall setting. This study partly fills this gap in the literature by investigating how female fashion shoppers respond to the shopping center environment and commit to mall patronage.",2015,/,Journal of Fashion Marketing & Management,19,1,3-21,,10.1108/JFMM-09-2012-0055,,#868,Michon 2015,"",""
Accurate conformational stability and cationic structure of piperidine determined by conformer-specific VUV-MATI spectroscopy,So Young Eom; Yu Ran Lee; Chan Ho Kwon,"Piperidine has received attention in pharmaceutical synthesis and biochemical degradation because of its conformational activity. We explored the conformational structures of piperidine in the neutral (S0) and cationic (D0) ground states by conformer-specific vacuum ultraviolet mass-analyzed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectroscopy, which provides high-resolution vibrational spectra for the corresponding cationic conformer. To identify conformers corresponding to the obtained VUV-MATI spectra, equilibrium structures of piperidine conformers in the S0 and D0 states were determined at various density functional theory levels, and potential energy surfaces associated with the conformational changes were constructed. Notably, the chair form interconverting between the equatorial NH and the axial NH conformers (Chair-Eq and Chair-Ax) in piperidine lies on the global minimum of the S0 state, but only the axial-like NH conformer (Chair-Ax-like) in chair form exists in the D0 state. The vibrational assignment of the observed spectra was accomplished through Franck–Condon (FC) analysis for adiabatic transitions between two Chair-Eq and Chair-Ax conformers and a cationic Chair-Ax-like conformer. Rigorous FC analysis revealed the precise structure of a cationic Chair-Ax-like conformer induced by removal of an electron from the lone-pair sp3 orbital of the nitrogen atom in piperidine. The adiabatic ionization energies of Chair-Eq and Chair-Ax conformers converting to a cationic state were determined to be 64 704 ± 4 cm−1 (8.0223 ± 0.0005 eV) and 64 473 ± 4 cm−1 (7.9936 ± 0.0005 eV), respectively. Consequently, the difference between their adiabatic ionization energies allowed the accurate determination of the conformational stability of Chair-Eq and Chair-Ax conformers in piperidine (231 ± 4 cm−1).",2020,/,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,22,39,22823-32,,10.1039/d0cp04407e,,#869,SoYoungEom 2020,"",""

Comparison of Perceptions of Barriers to Advancement for Women in Radiation Oncology between Men and Women Physicians,"Tam, A.; Thomas, R.; Kaul, A.; Barry, P.N.; Li, Y.R.","Purpose/Objective(s)While women now comprise the majority of medical school matriculants, there continues to be a disparity in representation of women in leadership roles and an attrition in the promotion pipeline in medicine. Prior studies have shown that women physicians face unique barriers to advancement in radiation oncology. Thus, understanding how perceptions of these barriers among men and women differ may shed light on why the ""leaky leadership pipeline"" exists.Materials/MethodsAn anonymous survey was disseminated to the American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO) members via email and social media between February and May 2023. In addition to demographics (age, gender, race, practice setting), respondents were asked to respond to statements about their perceptions of the gender barriers in the following domains: (a) equal access, (b) work-life balance, (c) gender bias, and (d) leadership support using a validated 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analyses with chi-square were performed using STATA.ResultsA total of 1107 respondents completed the survey. A majority of (77.1%) identified as female with 22.0% as male (the rest as either non-binary, transgendered, or decline to answer). More than half (53.8%) of participants were aged 30-39, with 76.0% identifying as (non-Hispanic) White. Only a minority (28.1%) of participants are employed at academic medical centers. Overall, we found that men and female radiation oncologists held similar perceptions, with no significant differences in rating between the two groups for 34 of the 45 statements (75.6%; p>0.05). The domains on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" had the most varied ratings, with significant differences in rating for five (41.7%) of 12 statements and five (26.3%) of 19 statements in the respective domain. For example, from the ""leadership support"" domain, 62.1% of women agreed that their chairs tried to ensure that women physicians were not subject to gender-based biases, compared to 52.9% of men (p = 0.01), and 61.1% of women agreed that their chairs were supportive when women physicians talked about work-family issues, compared to 56.1% of men (p = 0.02). Whereas statements from the ""equal access"" domain, 59.7% of women agreed that women physicians had equal access to career development opportunities (compared to 51.6% of men; p = 0.01) and 61.0% of women agreed that women physicians received equitable salaries (compared to 53.3% of men; p = 0.02).ConclusionIn this survey of radiation oncologists, we found that women and men shared similar perceptions of barriers to advancement for women physicians. However, there were some varied perspectives on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" and, unexpectedly, more men expressed concerns about gender equality within these domains than women physicians.

Consistent with the literature on professional development, we found a disparity between genders in the way engineering leaders were supported, from the level of sponsorship to experiences of negative organisational culture and the way gendered family norms affected leadership advancement opportunities. Drawing from our findings, we present lessons for engineering leadership educators, including the need to centre equity in leadership education. We do this in part to prepare students for the challenges and inequities within current workplace realities, but also to equip them with the knowledge and skills to contribute to more equitable practices and channels towards engineering leadership.",2023,/,European Journal of Engineering Education,48,6,1249-68,,10.1080/03043797.2023.2272819,,#883,Chan 2023,"",""
Qualities of transformative leaders in WASH: A study of gender-transformative leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Gonzalez, D.; Carrard, N.; Chhetri, A.; Somphongbouthakanh, P.; Choden, T.; Halcrow, G.; Budhathoki, R.; Wangchuk, U.; Willetts, J.","Introduction Equal access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for all requires leadership that prioritises and drives inclusion. Inclusive WASH also presents opportunities to advance equality more widely, with WASH a pathway to meaningful participation and empowerment for diverse groups. The concept of gender-transformative leadership-which connects ideas of leadership to transformative models of gender equality in development theory that challenge prevailing power structures-is a relevant lens for exploring inclusive WASH. This article shares findings and reflections from a positive deviance study that aimed to investigate gender-transformative leadership in the WASH sector to explore (i) the factors shaping gender-transformative leadership and the characteristics of gender-transformative leaders; (ii) actions taken by gender-transformative leaders; (iii) the types of outcomes achieved; and (iv) ways to strengthen gender-transformative leadership. Methods The study was undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic and consisted of interviews with 19 leaders in Bhutan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Nepal. We developed a conceptual framework which considers leaders' (i) personal values and traits; (ii) leadership styles; (iii) actions; and (iv) outcomes, influenced by a range of (v) enabling factors and barriers. Results Leaders' personal values and traits included a strong learning orientation, social justice values, humility, courage, and altruism. Leadership styles were primarily empathetic, with leaders guided by a mission to lead by example and pursue equality in their professional and personal lives. Exploration of actions and outcomes revealed a range of inclusion-oriented WASH activities responding to pandemic-related challenges, with associated potential outcomes in shifting norms. However, validation of outcomes was not possible due to the study timeframe and complexity of tracing complex social change in a positive deviance study reliant on self-reporting. Analysis of enablers and barriers to gender-transformative leadership respectively emphasized the importance of educational opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender norms. Conclusion Findings contribute to the body of knowledge on gender-transformative leadership, being the first study to connect this concept to WASH. Future research could build further evidence by applying the conceptual framework to analyze additional contexts or sectors, and by more fully articulating and validating outcomes in terms of their potential for gender-transformative leadership to drive equality both in and beyond WASH.

Women Leadership in the AGU Chapman Conference Series: Convener Impacts on the Science Program Committee,"Keiling, A.; Smith-Keiling, B.L.","Science conferences have increasingly come under a spotlight for inclusion and representation of marginalized groups. Here, we report on our analysis of the representation of women in conference leadership with regard to internal structure and dynamics at the Chapman conference series, spanning a period from 2007 to 2019. Chapman conferences are small, focused meetings in the Earth and space sciences, under the umbrella of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). They follow a two-leveled scientific leadership model, starting at conference inception by the organizing conveners and their selection of an invited science program committee. Our main findings were: (a) The average women proportion was less for the conveners (17%) than for the Science Program Committee (SPC) (24%), which is in line with the AGU demographics of attrition, assuming a different mix of career stages among conveners and SPC. At the individual conference level, the unfavorable case that convener or SPC teams were comprised only of men was nonetheless frequent. (b) On average, mixed convener teams, as opposed to all-men convener teams, selected a higher women representation among the SPC members (18% vs. 28%). (c) There were fewer all-men SPC teams when at least one woman was in the convener team (21% vs. 7%). In conclusion, while there was evidence that equitable representation can be achieved in the leadership, it still lagged in a consistent fashion for individual conferences. Targeted efforts for increased representation-especially at the convener level of the two-leveled conference model-are recommended, as increased women representation at the convener level may improve women representation of the SPC. © 2023 The Authors.",2023,/,Earth and Space Science,,,e2023EA002968 (10 pp.),,10.1029/2023EA002968,,#886,Keiling 2023,"",""

Materials and methods: Program Directors within the Radiology Residency Education Research Alliance were surveyed to gather information about program characteristics, incorporation of diversity in resident recruitment, the sponsoring department's commitment to efforts at expanding diversity, and a summary of their current and past residents, staff and faculty members (academic years 2020 and 2023) with respect to a list of diversity characteristics. Results: Survey response rate was 51 %. Sixty-three percent (15/24) of participating programs have departmental committees dedicated to DEI work; 46 % (11/24) of programs' departments have a Vice Chair for DEI. Sixty percent (15/24) of programs use their social media accounts to advertise their DEI programming efforts. Ninety-six percent (23/24) of programs participating in the survey use diversity factors to select candidates for their program.

Examining the Effectiveness of Gender Equity Initiatives to Support Women in Engineering,"Smith, N.E.; Chowdhury, S.; Costello, S.B.","Globally, women are a minority in the engineering profession. Various initiatives are adopted by employers to support women's career progression and retention in the profession. This paper examines the effectiveness of the common initiatives. Focus groups were conducted with 25 New Zealand based female engineers to explore their experiences and perceptions of women in engineering initiatives. Women discussed the effectiveness, and unintended consequences, of the initiatives. Their responses were coded using the NVivo software to identify key themes, which were then categorized using the universal/selective/indicated model. The findings show that universal initiatives which encompass men and women are well supported with few unintended consequences. These initiatives (e.g., subconscious bias training) focus less on changing or supporting women and more on changing the environment. In contrast, selective initiatives (e.g., female leadership programs) which focus on women, had mixed support and more unintended consequences. Specifically, they emphasize societal stereotypes that men are a better fit for the role of engineer and that women need help to adapt to the male-dominated environment. This study concludes with recommendations for employers to implement that will increase the participation and advancement of women in engineering.",2023,03/01,Journal of Management in Engineering,,,04022078 (10 pp.),,10.1061/JMENEA.MEENG-5014,,#888,Smith 2023,"",""
"I Am a Leader, I Am a Mother, I Can Do This! The Moderated Mediation of Psychological Capital, Work–Family Conflict, and Having Children on Well-Being of Women Leaders","Machin-Rincon, L.; Cifre, E.; Dominguez-Castillo, P.; Segovia-Perez, M.","Gender equality is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Management is one of the jobs that more clearly needs a gender perspective. Women leaders have found a way around the labyrinth to get to the top, which might have developed their personal resources such as psychological capital. Women leaders experience an inter-role conflict when work and family demands are mutually incompatible, affecting negatively their well-being. This study aims to analyze the mediation role that work-family and family-work conflict plays between psychological capital and well-being (engagement and burnout) when moderated by the number of children. In total, 202 Spanish women leaders participated in the study. Results of the mediated moderation model using Model 14 of the macro PROCESS for SPSS software show that psychological capital buffers the negative effects that experiencing work-family conflict has on well-being when having children. The well-being of women leaders is not affected when dealing with family interfering work conflict and having children. As such, women leaders who have children rely on their psychological capital to successfully manage the family demands affecting their work and to reduce the negative effect of work-family conflict on their well-being. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed from the psychology of a sustainability perspective.",2020,03/01,Sustainability,12,5,2100 (22 pp.),,10.3390/su12052100,,#889,Machin-Rincon 2020,"",""

The study utilises the cultural dimensions theory (Hofstede’s insights) and the social exchange concept as theoretical lenses to examine the phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: Using an exploratory qualitative approach, 40 interviews were conducted with senior academics and non-teaching staff working in Nigerian universities. Findings: The findings reveal hierarchical, patriarchal, servile, and interdependent values as the underlying characteristics of organisation culture, shaping the choice of leadership styles in the management of Nigerian universities. As a result, it emerged from the study that positional, formalised exchanges, paternalism, relational approach and gendered reactions to leadership were typically adopted in university administration in this context. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on a small qualitative sample size, which makes the generalisation of findings difficult. However, the study provides a good understanding of cultural hegemony, framing leadership styles different from those of western cultures. Originality/value: The findings of this study help to bridge the research gap concerning the implications of OC, and its influence on leadership behaviours in the Sub-Saharan African context.

"An exploration of sanitation-related decision-making, leadership, collective action, and freedom of movement among women in urban Tiruchirappalli, India","Doma, R.; Patrick, M.; Conrad, A.; Ramanarayanan, V.; Arun, S.; Sinharoy, S.S.; Caruso, B.A.","Introduction: Sanitation research in India has emphasized the disproportionate burden that unsafe and inadequate WASH can have on women and girls. However, there is a gap in research exploring women's agency in relation to their sanitation experiences, and agency is an integral domain of their empowerment. Methods: Cognitive interviews related to sanitation and empowerment were conducted with women in three life stages in India to validate survey tools that measure urban sanitation and women's empowerment; this paper is a secondary thematic analysis of qualitative data generated from 11 cognitive interviews in Tiruchirappalli, India, that focus on agency, specifically the sub-domains of decision-making, leadership, collective action, and freedom of movement. Women had the freedom to move to and from sanitation facilities and initiatives, with no restrictions from household members. Results: We observed differences at the household and community levels with women voicing more confidence, as well as the responsibility, to make sanitation-related decisions in the household than at the community level. Women mentioned strong trust and belief in women's sanitation-related leadership capabilities and support for women-led sanitation initiatives. However, many did not hold leadership positions themselves due to various limitations, from gendered responsibilities to women's lack of self-confidence. Women also discussed anecdotes of collectively working with other women toward improving the local sanitation environment. Discussion: This analysis highlights the value of strong trust and confidence among women in their ability to make important sanitation-related decisions at all levels of society. Maintaining and strengthening trust in female community members and highlighting women-led groups' achievements in the sanitation space should be prioritized. Community spaces must incorporate provisions that encourage women to share sanitation-related opinions in an environment that respects their engagement. WASH programming must engage with authority figures, leaders, and officials when seeking to increase women's agency and involvement with sanitation-related issues.

Views of female students who played the role of group leaders in introductory physics labs,"Doucette, Danny; Singh, Chandralekha","Understanding student views about learning physics in the lab context can be invaluable for efforts to improve student learning. In an ethnographic study in which two researchers observed introductory physics labs, we found that many women in mixed gender groups adopted the role of group leader or project manager and ensured that the group stayed on task and completed the lab work as expected throughout the semester. Here we report on an investigation of the views about the physics lab of four such female pre-medical students with high agency who came across as group leaders in a traditionally-taught introductory physics lab course for bio-science majors, and who strived to ensure that their group did well in the lab. Our findings are based on semi-structured interviews with these students. The interviews focused on diverse issues including the role of their male lab partners, other peers and the teaching assistant in their learning in the physics lab, their views about learning physics in lecture and lab courses, the role of physics labs in promoting conceptual understanding, learning in physics lab compared with other science labs, and the role of bio-inspired labs in their learning.

Findings Academic self-concept mediated the relationship between gender and leadership for all subjects and for self-reported heterosexual subjects but not for self-reported nonheterosexual subjects. Research limitations/implications Gender differences in leadership perceptions still exist and appear as early as the college years. The fact that academic self-concept did not mediate the relationship between gender and self-perceptions of leadership for nonheterosexual students might be explained by considering research that has identified different levels of gender conformity between straight and gay individuals. Practical implications Student self-perceptions of leadership could be improved if opportunities were provided for students showing that people other than White, male, heterosexuals can also be effective leaders.

A barriers thematic map, with quantitative logic, and a prevalence chart have been developed, with the aim to uncover inequalities and provide orientation to develop inclusion and equal opportunity strategies within different work environments. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review method was adopted across five electronic databases. Rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to select relevant publications, followed by critical appraisal of the eligible articles. The geographical target was Europe, with a publication time range spanning the period from 2000 to 2015. Certain specialized international studies were also examined. The key themes were identified using summative content analysis and the findings were analyzed using qualitative meta-summary method to formulate hypotheses for subsequent research. Findings - In total, 26 barriers were identified across the aforementioned sectors. A high degree of barriers commonalities was identified, with some striking differences between the prevalence of barriers across sectors. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study may need further validation using statistical methodology given the knowledge base gaps regarding the range of barriers and the differences in their prevalence. Bias and interpretation in reporting anchored in different theoretical frameworks ought to be further examined. Additional variables such as ambiguously stated barriers, sector overlap, women’s own choices, cultural and educational background and analysis in the context of the economic crisis, ensuing austerity and migratory pressure, are also worth exploring. Practical implications - Women’s notable and persisting underrepresentation in top leading positions across sectors reflects a critical drawback in terms of organizational and societal progress particularly regarding inclusion and balanced decision making. Practice-related blind spots may need to be further examined and addressed through specific policies. Originality/value - The comparative nature of barriers to women leadership across three sectors allows the reader to contrast the differences in gender inequalities and to comprehend inclusion challenges in healthcare, academia and business.

Measuring the Effectiveness of a Multicomponent Program to Manage Academic Stress through a Resilience to Stress Index,"Figueroa, Carlos; Ayala, Andres; Trejo, Luis A.; Ramos, Bertha; Briz, Clara L.; Noriega, Isabella; Chavez, Alejandro","In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent program that includes psychoeducation in academic stress, mindfulness training, and biofeedback-assisted mindfulness, while enhancing the Resilience to Stress Index (RSI) of students through the control of autonomic recovery from psychological stress. Participants are university students enrolled in a program of excellence and are granted an academic scholarship. The dataset consists of an intentional sample of 38 undergraduate students with high academic performance, 71% (27) women, 29% (11) men, and 0% (0) non-binary, with an average age of 20 years. The group belongs to the ""Leaders of Tomorrow"" scholarship program from Tecnológico de Monterrey University, in Mexico.

During the evaluation test, an assessment of the psychophysiological stress profile is performed while the participants undergo a stress test; it includes simultaneous recording of skin conductance, breathing rate, blood volume pulse, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Based on the pre-test and post-test psychophysiological variables, an RSI is computed under the assumption that changes in physiological signals due to stress can be compared against a calibration stage. The results show that approximately 66% of the participants improved their academic stress management after the multicomponent intervention program. A Welch’s t-test showed a difference in mean RSI scores (t = −2.30, p = 0.025) between the pre-test and post-test phases.

Multigenerational classrooms in higher education: equity and learning with technology,"Lowell, V.L.; Morris, J.M., Jr.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss potential challenges learners from different generations may have with current instructional methods using educational technologies in the classroom. The authors hope to create awareness to help improve equity in learning opportunities and assist educators in understanding the needs of multigenerational classrooms. Design/methodology/approach - In a narrative review of the literature, the authors present the current findings of the literature on generations in higher education and concerns for equity in learning opportunities. Findings - It is commonplace in undergraduate programs for learners of multiple generations to attend classes together and research has shown that historical context and generational experiences affect the values, attitudes and learning preferences of each generation. Therefore, higher education institutions should be aware of the demographic profile of their students, as well as the external populations from which they may recruit students, to ensure they are cognizant of the needs of these populations and can provide equality in learning opportunities. Practical implications - To assist with the needs of this changing student population, university leaders must consider generational characteristics to ensure equity in learning opportunity. Specifically, university leaders and educators in the classrooms will need to adapt and adjust for a changing student population providing instruction that meets the needs of multiple generations of learners, often within one classroom. Originality/value - Often when we think of diversity in the classroom we think of age, gender, race or even culture. Today we must add diversity in generations. Unlike other equity issues in education such as access (McLaughlin, 2010), educators may not be considering the equity in the design of their instruction to provide equitable learning experiences based on a learners’ knowledge and skills established by their experiences with technology. The lack of knowledge and skills a learner has with technology based on their experiences may create barriers to their ability to understand and complete instructional content involving technology (Wager, 2005). To ensure all learners can be successful, educators should strive to provide equality in learning opportunities when designing instruction including technology.",2019,/,International Journal of Information and Learning Technology,36,2,78-93,,10.1108/IJILT-06-2018-0068,,#903,Lowell 2019,"",""

Our respondents emphasize that women can be good leaders utilizing skills of listening, collaboration, and organization and it is not necessary to show agentic qualities to be considered a good leader. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research,35,8,588-599,,10.1080/02827581.2020.1825787,,#906,Larasatie 2020,"",""
"Rescuer, decision maker, and breadwinner: Women's predominant leadership across the post-Wenchuan earthquake efforts in rural areas, Sichuan, China","Hou, Chaoping; Wu, Haorui","Community engagement in disaster risk reduction activities assists women to discover and build their capacity for leadership before, during, and after disaster. In the study of the entire process after an extreme event, previous research has been scarce in the examination of women of different ages’ capacities of engagement, leadership, and resilience. Developed during 10 years of ongoing research after the Wenchuan earthquake, this paper employs qualitative research methodology that scrutinizes women's leadership at different stages of their lifespans during all the post-disaster stages (emergency rescue, short-term reconstruction, and long-term recovery and mitigation) that took place after the Wenchuan earthquake, in the rural areas of Sichuan Province, China. This paper discovers that (1) during the emergency rescue stage, women became rescuers augmenting and supporting the urgent response; (2) during the short-term reconstruction stage, women served as decision makers guiding the reconstruction of housing and communities; and (3) during the long-term recovery and mitigation stage, many women took on the role of breadwinner, managing the family livelihood and long-term development. From the perspective of built environment, this paper argues that women's leadership in managing existing and obtaining new resources (internal and external), in parallel effort alongside the official missions, not only strengthened the men's dominant aftermath efforts, but also promoted gender equity engagement in post-disaster reconstruction and recovery as well as powerfully advanced resilience capacity at individual, family, and community levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Safety Science,125,,,,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104623,,#908,Hou 2020,"",""
Workplace implications for female leaders from stereotype threat in a video conferencing context,"Donnelly, R.; Ryan, A.","Purpose - This study considered the use of video conferencing virtual backgrounds with employees located in a large multinational corporate organisation in Ireland and the USA to discern if background images evoking gendered stereotypes of leadership can cue stereotype threat in female technology workers undertaking a leadership activity, thus negatively effecting performance. This study aims to contribute to the body of research on stereotype threat by establishing whether virtual backgrounds used in video conferencing software are inherently identity safe or whether their use could have a negative performance impact on marginalised groups. Design/methodology/approach - Using a mixed methods research design with 22 participants in two countries working in the one large organisation, using two quantitative methods (an experiment and a survey) and one qualitative method (semi-structured interviews), the study examined the relationship between performance on the leadership activity and exposure to gendered backgrounds on a video conference call. Findings - It found that female leaders undertaking a leadership test experienced more anxiety and achieved lower scores on average when exposed to a male-gendered virtual background compared to male colleagues or female leaders exposed to a female gendered background. It was also found that these leaders were aware of the stereotype of leadership being White and male, and showed symptoms of prolonged exposure to stereotype threat in the workplace. While the authors still are working through a post-pandemic environment, it may be judicious for organisations to restrict the use of virtual backgrounds to identity-safe ones, specifically chosen by the company. Research limitations/implications - The study makes several practical recommendations, indicating actions which can be taken at the individual, team and corporate levels. Re-running this experiment in a more controlled environment with a larger sample set could yield more definitive, statistically significant results and contribute more to the literature. Practical implications - Some individual impacts were found via the interviews. Male leaders in the organisation need to do more to mentor and endorse their female colleagues. By doing this, they can counter the negative effects of solo status and the subsequent performance degradations of their female counterparts, while also setting an example for other leaders. Participation in the mentoring programme and initiatives such as Dare and value, inclusion, belonging, and equity should be encouraged and supported. Reverse mentoring should also be encouraged among the population of male leaders to aid in allyship and bias-awareness. Social implications - Teams should note that a democratic vote is not always the best way to decide on the names of teams, projects or meeting rooms. These may skew towards niche interests that can serve to alienate members of the team who do not associate themselves with that interest. Rather, the teams should strive to be fully inclusive and educated on the need for identity-safety. Team events may also serve to alienate members if teams are not mindful of the need to be inclusive. Activities, such as ""go-kart"" racing and physical or competitive team events have been highlighted as unsuitable for some team members, and should be avoided in favour of inclusivity. Originality/value - A significant body of research has documented the effect to which stereotype threat can be triggered by both the physical environment and by the use of various technology media. However, there is a dearth of research exploring the relationship between stereotype threat, defined as ""the concrete, real-time threat of being judged and treated poorly in settings where a negative stereotype about one's group applies"" (Steele et al., 2002, p. 385), and video conferencing software features, such as virtual backgrounds.",2023,/,International Journal of Organizational Analysis,31,8,106-30,,10.1108/IJOA-04-2023-3741,,#909,Donnelly 2023,"",""
Labelling them is negating them. A phenomenological study of stereotypes and followers’ experiences about women leadership in Pakistan,"Samo, A.H.; Qazi, S.W.; Buriro, W.M.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discover stereotypical beliefs of followers about female leadership and their possible outcomes in an organizational setting. Design/methodology/approach - With phenomenological methodology, this study used a qualitative approach, and credible data were gathered through semi-structured interviews from the employees of the education industry of Pakistan. Stereotypical beliefs and their outcomes were extracted through thematic analysis. Findings - The results show that female leaders are considered less fit for leadership role, which results in a reluctance in followership, the gap in communication and ineffective performance. Followers also tend to believe that women are less fit for pressure, resulting in a lack of trust and an intergroup conflict. The third stereotype that emerged from the results is that women are considered less fit for professionalism, which culminates in personal expectations, adverse effect on tasks and miscommunications. Research limitations/implications - This study is confined to the local context, and the results suggest that while female leaders are mild and a personal approach may have a positive effect on followers but in Pakistani society, they are considered less fit for an overall leadership role. Moreover, these stereotypes breed prejudgment and overshadow women’s identity as leaders. This paves the way forward for further exploratory inquiry of female leadership and the empirical test of these stereotypes and their outcomes. Practical implications - This study is a standpoint for organizations, present and potential female leaders to be conscious of existing stereotypes and their dire outcomes. It can also be used in government policymaking for initiatives to mitigate these stereotypes to harvest diversity and female empowerment. The leading leadership trainers of Pakistan can also be benefited from the contextual scientific information about female leadership. Social implications - A society like that of Pakistan, which is striving to mitigate the gender inequality gap in every walk of life, needs to scientifically know the assumptions in the minds of people regarding women. The present study serves this purpose for women in a leadership capacity in an organizational setting. Originality/value - This study is the first of its kind in the local context and paves the way for further research in diversity in leadership.",2019,/,Management Research Review,42,3,391-411,,10.1108/MRR-04-2018-0170,,#910,Samo 2019,"",""

Conceptual and theoretical frameworks for leveraging makerspaces to encourage and retain underrepresented populations in STEM through learning by design,"Nichols, L.; Gorsky, R.; Corum, K.","Amidst this era of rapid technological advancement, the impact of White dominance in STEM causes inequity throughout the design, implementation, and function of modern technologies. Evidence of this includes AI systems that perpetuate racial and gender biases, medical devices that are incompatible with non-White medical needs, and hiring algorithms that prioritize the White male experience. Though not a panacea, greater representation of traditionally marginalized groups in the STEM workforce will help reduce and safeguard against digital racism, sexism, and ableism. Advocates of greater representation in STEM fields suggest that makerspace pedagogy and design that is rooted in equity and inclusivity can attract students from traditionally marginalized groups and make STEM more accessible and welcoming to all. To this end, this paper proposes a modification of the TPACK theoretical framework (Koehler and Mishra in Contemp Issues Tech Teach Educ 9(1):60-70, 2009) that centers knowledge of technological and inclusive practices in Makerspaces, giving rise to the Maker Technology, Pedagogy, Inclusion, and Content Knowledge (MakerTPICK) theoretical framework.

This framework outlines the process for makerspace leaders to create and sustain an inclusive makerspace through the MakerTPICK framework, be they teachers in a school setting or makerspace coordinators outside of the field of K-12 education.

Black Girl Magic or Queen Bee: An Exploration of Gendered Leadership in South African Business,"Ramnund-Mansingh, A.","Gendered research is plagued by an array of challenges within a South African business context and the unique political landscape. Even with well-established equity legislation and corporate governance compliance, the number of women in leadership remains bleak. The King IV reporting requirement of women at the board level places significant pressure on the existing employment equity goals for organizations in South Africa. Black women who attain leadership positions are criticized for being token affirmative action placements, and the lack of support is driving them out of the C-suite.

Challenges and barriers to e-leadership participation: Examining the perspectives of Malaysian secondary school teachers,"Ping, C.S.; Tahir, L.M.; Rosli, M.S.; Atan, N.A.; Ali, M.F.","In recent years, the role of information and communication technology (ICT) has increasingly impacted school instructional and leadership practices. With the assistance of ICT, interactions between school leaders and teachers have undergone tremendous changes that have reduced face-to-face contact. However, only a limited number of studies have evaluated the barriers and challenges to participating in ICT-based e-leadership in schools. Therefore, this sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was designed to examine these challenges and barriers to teachers' participation in e-leadership platforms. Feedback from samples of 260 current secondary school teachers was obtained via a survey using the convenience sampling method. The internal consistencies of the items were also checked using exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses. Parametric tests such as the independent t-test and ANOVA were conducted to determine the differences between teachers' perceptions based on their demographic factors: age, gender and years of teaching experience. In addition, regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between teachers' demographics and the challenges they encountered. Furthermore, 10 teachers were interviewed to obtain detailed explanations of the challenges and barriers they faced while participating in e-leadership systems. Thematic analysis was employed to assess the interview transcript data. The quantitative findings revealed that the challenges faced by teachers included ineffective ICT equipment in schools, ICT equipment in schools that needs to be updated, lack of understanding in using the ICT system, a lack of knowledge derived from limited support courses and workshops to assist educators, ineffective school's ICT system and disturbance of their free time. From interview sessions, teachers have mentioned significant issues related to internet networks, teachers' willingness to ignore certain issues, and perceived intrusions on privacy. In examining differences related to challenges and barriers to e-leadership based on teachers' demographics, the ANOVA and independent t-test analyses revealed that most of these differences were non-significant, except for teachers' gender and teaching experience.

"The influence of gender, and race/ethnicity on advancement in information technology (IT)","McGee, K.","With increased attention paid to the lack of diversity in U.S. technology firms, little attention is paid to women already in the technology workforce who aspire to senior leadership roles. This research study focused on understanding the experiences of African American/black, Asian American, European American/white, and Hispanic American/Latina women who advanced from technical/operational IT roles to senior IT executive (SITE) roles in corporate America. Previous research solely focused on gender, race, or ethnicity provided an insufficient and limited description of women's advancement journey. Rather than treat gender and race/ethnicity as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis, this study approached the topic from a gender intersectionality perspective and used the individual differences theory of gender and IT as an analytical lens. Specifically, the study examined women's career progression in a more nuanced manner-observing gender within race or ethnic group-which provided greater insight into the participants' advancement journey.The intent of this study was to understand how individual and organizational factors influenced each participant's career progression and what role, if any, gender and race/ethnicity played in the journey. As a result of the analysis, six themes emerged: Pathways to the SITE Role; Informal Networks; Bias; Credibility and Legitimacy; Support; and Technical Skills. Issues of gender and race/ethnicity permeated most of the factors and influenced whether the factors helped or hindered. Although some findings support existing research on women's career barriers, the intent was not to generalize the findings to all women. Rather, the study's results demonstrate that racial and ethnic variations among the women in addition to a variety of other factors contribute to different career progression experiences.

Gender disparity in leadership boosts affective commitment and tacit knowledge sharing about libraries,"Sharif, S.; Lodhi, R.N.; Iqbal, K.; Saddique, F.","Purpose This study aims to use an authentic leadership style to explore that whether male or female leadership of private academic institutions highly influences affective organizational commitment and tacit knowledge sharing among the library teachers. Additionally, this study encompasses the trust of library teachers and justifies whether the trust under male or female leadership highly moderates the effect on tacit knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach By using structural equation modeling, this study tests two leadership models (e.g. male and female leadership models). Using a convenient sampling approach, the researcher collects data from library teachers of private academic institutions in district Sheikhupura, Pakistan through face-to-face interaction. The study administered 650 survey questionnaires among the library teachers; however, 403 questionnaires were answered validly and reliably. The response rate was 62%. Findings The study found the direct and indirect effect of authentic leadership on affective organizational commitment and tacit knowledge sharing however, male authentic leadership influence on affective organizational commitment and tacit knowledge sharing was quite higher than female authentic leadership. Resultantly, the library teachers were more committed to sharing tacit knowledge under male leadership than female. Nevertheless, the moderating role of trust was found in female leadership but not in male leadership. Simply, the library teachers under male leadership were hesitant to trust others, so the chain of sharing hidden ideas and image of libraries was not found in male leadership. Practical implications Private academic institutions need authentic leaders to shape the knowledge economy of libraries and the structure of the academic institutions. For this reason, this study provides practical implications for managers that male leadership should be hired in academic institutions because it has a higher influence on librarians' commitment and tacit knowledge sharing among peers as compare to female leadership.

Changes in motion patterns among pregnant women turning while carrying an object after rising from a chair,"Sunaga, Yasuyo; Takahashi, Makoto; Anan, Masaya; Shinkoda, Koichi","During pregnancy, changes in physical function, such as increases in the mass and volume of the abdomen, affect spinal alignment and the postural control system. Pregnant women often experience changes in motion patterns, as well as an increased risk of falling, during routine tasks such as rising from a chair and carrying objects. The present study aimed to analyze changes in motion patterns among pregnant women when performing a motion task involving rising from a chair, picking up plates, and walking forward while carrying the plates after turning. The study participants were nine pregnant and seven nulliparous women. The pregnant women were examined between the 16th and 18th, 24th and 25th and 32nd and 33rd weeks of gestation.

Does leadership gender diversity drive corporate social responsibility and organizational outcomes? The role of organization size,"Ali, M.; Grabarski, M.K.; Ahmed, S.; Imtiaz, N.","Corporate scandals, environmental damages, and employment conditions have highlighted the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR). However, little is known about (1) the simultaneous effects of board and top management team (TMT) gender diversity on CSR, (2) the mediating role of CSR between leadership (board/TM) gender diversity and organizational outcomes, and (3) the above-noted effects vary between large versus small organizations. Drawn from social role theory, we test our hypotheses using multisource time-lagged data from 248 organizations. The results indicate that both board and TMT gender diversity are positively associated with CSR. Moreover, CSR had a positive effect on both perceived organizational performance and employee productivity, with CSR also mediating the relationship between board gender diversity and perceived organizational performance. The findings also show the moderating effect of organization size on the CSR-organizational outcomes relationship. Our results refine (differential effects of gender diversity on CSR depending on the role), extend (some unprecedented effects were found for perceived organizational performance and employee productivity), and qualify (effects were significant for large organizations) social role theory. Our research addresses the above-noted knowledge gaps and informs the contextual leadership gender diversity practice for improved CSR and organizational outcomes.

Factors affecting the patient safety activities of hospital nurses: A cross-sectional study focusing on shared leadership,"Kim, Bokyung; Yu, Soyoung","Shared leadership is a team state of mutual leadership influence among peers. The current study investigates the effects of nurses’ perceptions regarding shared leadership and organizational commitment on the patient safety activities of nurses. Results have been reported on the effectiveness of shared leadership across multiple disciplines, including healthcare. In this descriptive study, the participants were 160 nurses working at 2 hospitals in South Korea. Data were collected from October 14 to 21, 2020, using a structured questionnaire measuring shared leadership, organizational commitment, and patient safety activities. The STROBE checklist was used to ensure the quality of reporting. Shared leadership averaged 3.72, organizational commitment averaged 3.35, and patient safety activities averaged 4.28 out of 5. The difference in patient safety activities according to the participant's general characteristics showed significant statistical differences in terms of the education level, current working ward, and number of department workers. Through regression analysis, shared leadership was identified as the variable that influenced patient safety activities the most. To increase the quality of the patient safety activities of nurses, it is necessary to build an organizational culture formation and development system so that all staff can participate in not only problem-solving but also decision-making, while exercising shared leadership. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Safety Science,174,,,,10.1016/j.ssci.2024.106460,,#930,Kim 2024,"",""
"The influence of female agentic and communal leadership on work engagement: vigour, dedication and absorption","Dunlop, R.; Scheepers, C.B.","Purpose The purpose of this study is investigating the influence of leadership on work engagement. The definition of leadership is primarily couched in culturally masculine terms (and known as an agentic leadership style) that disfavours women, who are often perceived as being communal leaders who are compassionate and humble. The research gap addressed is whether communal and agentic leadership styles of female leaders have positive associations with work engagement. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative study was undertaken by applying purposive non-probability sampling and using an online survey with screening questions to ensure the respondent reported to a senior female manager. The survey consisted of reliable and valid Likert scales: agentic and communal leadership styles were assessed using the Agency-Communion-Inventory (AC-IN) scale with 20 questions and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) with three sub-scales: vigour, dedication and absorption. The 153 usable responses in this study were used to conduct validity and reliability tests and to apply multiple regression to test associations. Findings Both agentic and communal leadership have a positive impact on work engagement when exhibited by a female. Although agentic leadership had an influence on all the elements of work engagement, communal leadership had a far stronger impact. Originality/value Female managers with communal leadership styles need to realise that they have more influence on their employees' emotional, physical and cognitive connections to their work than female managers with agentic leadership styles. Those with agentic leadership styles need to exhibit a communal style as well, so as to enhance the influence they have on their employees' work engagement.",2023,/,Management Research Review,,,437-66,,10.1108/MRR-11-2021-0796,,#932,Dunlop 2023,"",""
Gender Representation and Leadership in Local Transport Decision-Making Positions,"Hiselius, L.W.; Kronsell, A.; Rosqvist, L.S.; Dymen, C.; Stepanova, O.","This paper aims to analyse and further capture nuances of gender representation in local political decision-making bodies, focusing on implications for transport policy. Since gender is highly relevant for both attitudes towards transport policy as well as political votes, data on the gender and political colour of executives (members of presidiums) of transport-related committees, councils, and boards is analysed. The study is aimed at the local level, since municipal transport policy decisions include areas with clear differences between masculinity and femininity norms. The mapping of representation reveals, in line with other studies, that women are underrepresented in the most leading position (as chairperson of the City Board 31-37%), and that presidiums of transport-related committees, especially, are highly dominated by men (72-74%) with no clear positive trend in female representation identified over the studied years. The result suggests that transport-related decisions are disproportionally shaped by men as well as masculine norms, with implications for the transition towards transport sustainability.",2023,/,Sustainability,,,11280 (13 pp.),,10.3390/su151411280,,#933,Hiselius 2023,"",""
Leaving women to hold the baby: the real reason for the gender gap?,"Vella, H.","Despite continued efforts, the engineering and technology sector is failing to close the so-called gender gap, with ratios of women in the industry compared to men still shockingly low. Only 12.37 per cent of UK engineers are women, and females hold only 5 per cent of leadership positions in the technology sector, according to PwC. Yet, while the industry is deploying various initiatives, little attention has been given to inequality around parental leave policies that discriminate against women and leave them, quite literally, `holding the baby'. Evidence of the so-called `pregnancy penalty' is both ample and damning. The University of Bristol in October 2019 provided some stark statistics. It found only 27.8 per cent of women from more than 3,500 new parents were still in full-time work or self-employed three years after childbirth, compared to 90 per cent of new fathers. This contrast in employment status post-partum is due to a myriad of reasons; many directly connected to where childcare duties fall. And while who is tasked with ‘holding the baby’ is considered a personal choice, the reality is that current parental leave policies make women carers by default.",2020,02/,Engineering & Technology,15,1,52-5,,,,#934,Vella 2020,"",""
Context and person-oriented leader in teams: a meta-analytical review,"Ceri-Booms, M.","Purpose - The research studies the role of contextual moderating variables on the relationship between person-oriented leadership behaviors (POLBs) and team performance. The authors claim that the varying effect sizes between POLBs and team performance are large because of the context the team is functioning in. Therefore, based on the framework of Johns (2006), this paper aims to investigate the moderating role of the relevant demographic (leader gender), social (in-group collectivism and team size), task (skill differentiation) and methodological (common method bias and the rater of the team performance) contextual variables in the study. Design/methodology/approach - The authors accumulated evidence from 48 independent primary studies (N team = 4,276) to run the meta-analytic analyses. The authors followed the procedures described by Schmidt and Hunter (2015). For the categorical moderators, the analyzes were aided by the Hunter-Schmidt meta-analysis programs (2.0) (Schmidt and Le, 2014), which is an interactive software using a random-effects model. In the analyzes for the continuous moderators, the authors used Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) statistical package for the social sciences macros and run meta-regressions using a random-effects model with unrestricted maximum likelihood. Findings - The results indicate that the relationship weakens when female leaders exhibit these behaviors and when the team size increases. On the other hand, in-group collectivism strengthens the relationship. The study also found that the common method bias and the assessment method of the team performance are significant moderators altering the relationship. Practical implications - The study highlights the perceptual differences and biases based on leader gender. Acknowledging these biases may help practitioners to appreciate the female qualities in leadership and decrease the undervaluation of female effectiveness. To create high-performing teams, leaders in high ingroup collectivist countries are expected to develop a family feeling in the team by showing their concern for personal issues and build close interpersonal relationships. Researchers should use multiple sources to assess the predictor and criterion variables and also opt for more objective assessment methods for team performance. Originality/value - With this study, the authors follow a substantively different perspective compared to the past meta-analytic reviews on this relationship. Rather than testing the inquiry whether there is a relationship between the two variables, the authors specifically focus on the role of contextual moderating variables. Several researchers have acknowledged that contextual considerations are critical in leadershipteam performance research. Nevertheless, the body of research remains to be not cohesive. Thus, the study answers a call in the leadership area for a more context-based and cohesive understanding of the effects of leadership on team performance.",2020,/,Team Performance Management: An International Journal,26,1-2,91-121,,10.1108/TPM-11-2019-0111,,#935,Ceri-Booms 2020,"",""

This article provides systematic evidence of (a) female participation rates from the perspective of published journal articles in 46 Scopus medical subject categories 1996-2018 and (b) gender differences in citation rates 1996-2014. The results show female proportion increases 1996-2018 in all fields and a female majority of first-authored articles in two-fifths of categories, but substantial differences between fields. A paper is 7.3 times more likely to have a female first author in Obstetrics and Gynaecology than in Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine. Only three fields had a female last author majority by 2018, a probable side effect of ongoing problems with appointing female leaders. Female first-authored research tended to be more cited than male first-authored research in most fields (59%), although with a maximum difference of only 5.1% (log-transformed normalised citations). In contrast, male last-authored research tends to be more cited than female last-authored research, perhaps due to cases where a senior male has attracted substantial funding for a project.

"Perceptions of DEIA, Job Satisfaction, and Leadership Among U.S. Federal Government Employees","Junior, C.; Hollywood, N.; Padgett, J.","Aim/Purpose: The quantitative comparative ex post facto research study covered in this paper aims to fill gaps in the literature by focusing on whether gender influences perceptions of leadership; diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA); and job satisfaction among federal employees within the Department of Justice using empirical data. The study also explores whether there are relationships between the perception of leadership and job satisfaction and the perception of DEIA and job satisfaction. Background: Since 2002, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has administered the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), which measures employee perceptions of whether and to what extent successful organizational conditions exist in their agencies. Areas currently assessed within the FEVS include training, job satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, management effectiveness, work-life balance, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. The exploration of variations in perceptions of leadership, DEIA efforts, and job satisfaction among U.S. federal employees by gender and other criteria are crucial areas for research that are underrepresented in the literature. This is not only important for the United States federal government, which is grappling with high attrition rates, but also for public administrations around the world. Methodology: A quantitative ex post facto research design was used to analyze data from responses of U.S. federal employees working for the Department of Justice. Leadership, job satisfaction, and DEIA were all measured using aggregate scores from predetermined question sets. Differences based on gender were analyzed using t-tests. Additionally, chi-squares and Spearman's rank correlations were employed in order to explore whether there is a relationship between the perception of leadership and job satisfaction and the perception of DEIA efforts and job satisfaction among U.S. federal government workers. Contribution: The findings of this study aid in providing empirical data to support the need for federal government leadership to understand the impact of employees' perceptions on their willingness to continue working in the federal government. The research study was grounded in Public Service Motivation Theory, which centers around factors that motivate individuals to pursue and maintain careers in the public service sector. More specifically, this study supported the public service motivation theory in that it looked at gender as a mitigating factor in public service motivation as well as explored the role of leadership and DEIA as a correlating factor to job satisfaction. The results of this research have practical implications for federal government leaders interested in increasing employee motivation and retention and who should be considering the range of socio-cultural and demographic characteristics that have been found in the research to impact employee perceptions and experiences. Findings: The analyses found differences in perceptions of leadership, DEIA, and job satisfaction among United States Federal Government employees based on gender. Additionally, perceptions of leadership and DEIA were both found to influence job satisfaction. The first research question explored in this study used a t-test to consider whether the perception of leadership among U.S. federal employees differed based on participant gender with significance found. The second research question examined whether the perceived job satisfaction of U.S. federal employees differed based on gender, with statistical significance detected. The third research question focused on whether perception of DEIA differed when gender was explored and the results of the t-test indicated a significant difference in perceptions of DEIA when gender was considered. The fourth research question considered the relationship between the perception of leadership and job satisfaction. A Chi-square and a Spearman Rank Correlation were performed, and a relationship was found to exist. Research question five explored whether a relationship exists between the perception of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives and job satisfaction, with significance found following a chi-square and a Spearman rank correlation. Recommendations for Practitioners: Leadership behaviors of managers and the existence of DEIA policies play a critical role in employees' job satisfaction and commitment. The recommendations for organizational leadership in the public service sector include addressing gender inequality in work practices and environments and cultivating more inclusive organizational cultures. Recommendations for Researchers: The lack of inclusion of socio-cultural norms in the research on public service motivation is a gap that has yet to be sufficiently addressed and is an area of research that should be explored. Impact on Society Research on public service motivation in local, state, national, and international government employment can aid organizations in developing strategies for improving recruitment, selection, and retention in public service organizations. This information can advance scientific knowledge on transforming management and leadership practices across sectors. Future Research Future research can expound on what has been done here by examining in more detail how various identities, and more specifically intersecting identities, within the LGBTQIA+ community as well as other historically marginalized groups, impact such factors as perceptions of leadership, job satisfaction, employee motivation and retention, and work-life balance. Perceptions of specific DEIA initiatives should also be further explored.",2024,/,Journal of Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology,21,,1-17,,10.28945/5328,,#938,Junior 2024,"",""

Different forms of industry interactions, including working in industry, industry cooperation and industry consulting, all make TTO-bypassing more likely, with some interesting differences across gender. Further, as expected, academics favoring free public access to their research are less likely to bypass TTOs.

The AAPM website was also used to identify members who have served on the Medical Physics Editorial Board. The Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP) website was used to identify the current directors of graduate and residency programs (as of July 2019). Because gender was not a reported field in any of these categories, gender was assigned by reviewing names and photographs. Percentage representation in these respects was compared to the overall percentage of women in the AAPM in 2019 (23.3%) and reported the number of women working as medical physicists globally (29.8%). Within the AAPM, the percentage of women reporting clinical leadership roles is 12.0% within the US, 13.6% in Canada, and 18.0% in all other countries combined. Women comprise only 7.5% of CAMPEP graduate program directors and 21.5% of residency program directors. The percentage of female presidents in AAPM is 8.1%.

Cameron Young Investigators Symposium Award, the percentage of all female AAPM awardees is less than the percentage of women AAPM members. The lowest percentage of female representation within AAPM is among council chairs with only one woman having held a chair position out of 42 positions (2.4%) from 1970 to July 2019.

Self-efficacy of engineering students at a South African university-findings from a longitudinal study,"Lourens, Ann S.; Pannell, Liesl S.","Internationally and nationally, governments, professional body organisations and higher education institutions and are launching initiatives to attract and retain women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) fields. This article reports on the fourth phase in a longitudinal study aimed at determining the levels of self-efficacy of first-year engineering students at a South African university. It further reports on the impact of co-curricular interventions, presented as a leadership development programme (LDP), that was developed to assist women engineering students (WES) belonging to the Women in Engineering Leadership Association (WELA) to improve their feelings of self-efficacy. It was proposed that these interventions could contribute to WELA members outgrowing their perceived insecurities and negative perceptions and result in well-balanced, self-assured and effective WES, and, in turn, women engineer employees. Participation in and completion of the LDP could thereby improve the retention of women in the field of engineering. To measure the self-efficacy of engineering students, the Self-Efficacy Instrument for Engineering Students (SEIES) was developed. The instrument measured students' perceived motivation and confidence relative to nine identified subscales. The findings of the study indicated no significant differences in the self-efficacy of male engineering students (MES), WES and WELA members, even though the results indicated that WELA members scored slightly higher on most of the subscales measured. Based on this study, it became evident that specifically-designed developmental programmes such as WELA could have a positive influence on the self-efficacy of WES.

Design/methodology/approach - Non-probability sampling technique is employed to collect primary data through a self-administered questionnaire from 492 academicians of a higher education institution situated in western Uttar Pradesh of India. The data set was analyzed using statistical tools like descriptive statistics (z-test and ANOVA), and multiple regression analysis. Findings - Results of the multiple regression analysis reflected direct and significant relationship between inclusive workplace and OCB. It has been observed that organizations with a conducive climate of inclusion, a well formulated inclusive practices and strong leaders’ commitment will result into high level of OCB which is apparent among employees working in a higher education institution western Uttar Pradesh. The results of z-test reflected that male and female employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate. However, there is a significant difference in perception toward inclusive practices and inclusive leadership on OCB. On the other hand, results of ANOVA reflected that with respect to religious orientation there is no significant difference among perceptions toward inclusive workplace. However in case of category employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate in contrast with inclusive practices and inclusive leadership. Research limitations/implications - The present study established the concept of inclusive workplace, entirely on the basis of individual viewpoint. While to examine the cause and effect relationship of an inclusive workplace on OCB, it is recommended to incorporate some moderating or intervening variables. Practical implications - This study provides guidelines for academic institutions to understand and foster an inclusive workplace that will encourage the academicians to exhibit OCB. Originality/value - Very little research had examined the relationship between inclusive workplace and OCB. This research will add value to the existing literature on inclusive workplace and its probable impact on organizations and individuals by examining this relationship with respect to gender, category and religious orientation of employees working in higher educational institution of India.",2018,/,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",37,6,530-50,,10.1108/EDI-03-2017-0054,,#949,Panicker 2018,"",""
Emotional and Motivational Correlates of Leadership Styles: A Comprehensive Framework for Understanding Effective Leaders,"Vidic, Z.; Burton, D.; South, G.; Pickering, A.M.; Start, A.","It is widely believed that contemporary leaders must possess highly developed interpersonal, motivational, social, and emotional skills. However, empirical evidence documenting the specific role emotional intelligence (EI) and motivational constructs play in leadership is equivocal to date (e.g., Harms & Crede, 2010; Lindebaum & Cartwright, 2010; Walter, Cole, & Humphrey, 2011). The current study examined a proposed working leadership model based on four distinct leadership styles LSs; (i.e., servant, transformational, transactional, and passive/avoidant) that could be viewed on an autonomy-sophistication continuum based on readiness and strengths of both leaders and followers. Participants included 535 male and female junior college and high school students at a military academy. Cluster analysis (CA) results revealed four unique LS profiles that capture different combinations of the four LS styles. LS profiles were compared on a range of motivational and EI dimensions. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results revealed support for hypothesized profile differences, including: (a) all three social motivation subscales, (b) both learning and capacity ability beliefs, (c) task but not ego motivational orientation, and (d) three revised EI subscales created when exploratory factor analysis failed to confirm the hypothesized Emotional and Social Competence Inventory factor structure for this cadet sample.",2016,,Journal of Leadership Studies,10,3,22-40,,10.1002/jls.21485,,#950,Vidic 2016,"",""
Relational age and leader-member exchange: mediating role of perceived trust,"Gupta, M.; Bhal, K.T.; Ansari, M.A.","Purpose Drawing on similarity-attraction hypothesis and generational gap literatures, this study aims to examine the impact of age difference in a leader-member dyad on leader-member exchange (LMX). The study hypothesized that relational age would impact the subordinates-reported LMX. However, given that leaders have structural power over subordinates and hence have mechanisms of interaction available to them, the age difference might not determine their perception of quality of LMX. The study also hypothesized that generation gap in values and beliefs leads to lack of trust, on the part of subordinates, which in turn might be the reason for poor quality of LMX. Design/methodology/approach A total of 200 leader-member dyads from five organizations in the National Capital Region of India were used in this study. Data were collected via separate structured questionnaires for leaders and members, which comprised of standard scales of LMX and perceived trust, and demographics. Findings Hypotheses received substantial support from the data with a few exceptions. Only the loyalty dimension of perceived trust mediates the relationship between relational age and member perception of LMX. Research limitations/implications Results have implications for relational age and LMX interventions. However, the results are to be viewed in the light of members' perspective. While this is a common practice in LMX research, it would be interesting to explore leaders' trust and psychological reactions as well, for additional insights into leadership practice. Originality/value Limited work has been done to explore the impact of relational age on LMX, that too mediated by trust. An attempt has been made in this study to do so via leader-member dyads.",2020,/,Journal of Indian Business Research,12,4,563-76,,10.1108/JIBR-05-2018-0144,,#951,Gupta 2020,"",""
Are female leaders more efficient in family firms than in non-family firms?,"Bjuggren, P.-O.; Nordstrom, L.; Palmberg, J.","Purpose - The aim of this study is to investigate whether female leaders are more efficient in family firms than in non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a unique database of ownership and leadership in private Swedish firms that makes it possible to analyze differences in firm performance due to female leadership in family and non-family firms. The analysis is based on survey data merged with micro-level data on Swedish firms. Only firms with five or more employees are included in the analysis. The sample contains more than 1,000 firms. Findings - The descriptive statistics show that there are many more male than female corporate leaders. However, the regression analysis indicates that female leadership has a much more positive impact on the performance of family firms than on that for non-family firms, where the effect is ambiguous. Originality/value - Comparative studies examining the impact of female leadership on firm-level performance in family and non-family firms are rare, and those that exist are most often either qualitative or focused on large, listed firms.

The authors further examine gender and socio-economic status (SES) as important moderators of the proposed relationships. Design/methodology/approach The present investigation consists of a two-study research design, based on data collected from young adult samples across two culturally different countries, namely the UK (N = 267) and Japan (N = 127). Findings The study presents evidence of self-perceptions of leadership influencing LSE and MTL. The results further support the mediating role of leader self-efficacy. Regarding the moderating role of gender, results in both samples showed that the effects of leader self-efficacy on MTL were stronger for males. SES was found to moderate the effects of leadership self-perceptions of negative implicit leadership theories (ILTs) on LSE in the UK sample and the effects of leadership self-perceptions of positive ILTs on LSE in the Japanese sample. Originality/value This study fills the gap of empirical research focused on early adulthood influences on leadership development. In particular, this study has a three-fold contribution, by, firstly, developing a conceptual model that examines the role of young adults' self-perceptions of leadership on their self-efficacy as leaders and MTL; secondly examining contingencies of the proposed relationships; and thirdly testing the conceptual model in two countries.",2021,/,Leadership & Organization Development Journal,42,2,289-315,,10.1108/LODJ-03-2020-0112,,#953,Hoyland 2021,"",""
Leadership: the Act of Making Way for Others,"Wickens, Joelle D. J.; Gupta, Anisha","Conservation in the United States (USA) is an elite field of mostly white, upper-middle-class women. While there have been efforts over the decades to diversify the field, they have not been successful in significantly changing the demographics. In January 2020, the authors embarked on addressing one aspect of diversification: shifting the culture from one of exclusion to one that listens to and takes direction from those who are excluded. We planned a workshop we thought was designed to include the excluded. We found it was still steeped in practices that maintain the dominant culture. This paper outlines how the experience of the global pandemic, the move from an in-person to an online workshop, and the impact of the social justice uprising resulting from George Floyd’s murder fundamentally changed how we designed and led this workshop. Our growth was shaped significantly by developing an understanding of White Supremacy Culture (WSC), a system where perfectionism, defensiveness, paternalism, either/or thinking, individualism, and objectivity help maintain the status quo. This new perspective informed the creation of a series of sessions where we acknowledged, examined, and deconstructed power and privilege. We learned that if we want to achieve inclusion, we must understand the current culture of exclusion and the ways it prevents the work of building inclusive spaces. Though WSC as defined here is specific to the USA, cultures of exclusion exist worldwide. Lessons learned from trying to dismantle WSC in US conservation can be applied more broadly to create equitable professional and social communities around the world. © 2022 The Author(s).

Why do people speak about products online? The role of opinion leadership,"Chai, S.; Choi, B.; Kim, M.; Cheng, T.C.E.","In an online social networking services (SNS) community, a group of users that have great influence on the other users are called opinion leaders. They have received much research attention because they are capable of influencing other people's purchasing behaviors. In this research, we investigate various motivational factors that influence SNS users' electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) intention. In addition, we examine the role of opinion leadership in e-WOM intention. By using survey methodology approach based on prior research, we collected data from 405 SNS users in the U.S. This research utilized the partial least squares technique for analysing empirical data. We find that intrinsic motivational factors embracing altruism, self-efficacy, and self-expression universally influence SNS users' e-WOM intention regardless of opinion leadership. However, extrinsic motivational factors comprising economic rewards, reputation feedback, and social ties only influence SNS users' e-WOM intention through opinion leadership. This research fills a gap in the literatures by establishing a comprehensive research framework including intrinsic and extinct driving forces on E-WOM intention. It emphasizes the significance of opinion leadership in the context of SNS users' purchasing behaviour. This study constructs a research model to discern the differences in the magnitude of impact between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors on e-WOM intention via opinion leadership. Our results confirm that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations positively affect SNS users' perceived opinion leadership. Our research findings imply that firms need to strengthen their efforts in fostering users' perceived opinion leadership to utilize e-WOM in SNS community if they want to use extrinsic motivational factors to promote e-WOM behavior.",2023,/,Information Technology and Management,,,1-17,,10.1007/s10799-022-00359-7,,#955,Chai 2023,"",""
The effect of exploitative leadership on knowledge hiding: a conservation of resources perspective,Limin Guo; Ken Cheng; Jinlian Luo,"Purpose Drawing on conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study aims to explore the influencing mechanism of exploitative leadership on knowledge hiding.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 324 employees of a high-technology company in China by a three-wave questionnaire survey. Hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping approach were employed to test hypotheses. Findings This study found that exploitative leadership was positively related to knowledge hiding and that psychological distress mediated this relationship. Moreover, the results revealed that the positive relationship between exploitative leadership and psychological distress and the indirect effect of exploitative leadership on knowledge hiding via psychological distress were stronger when hostile attribution was high rather than low. Practical implications The findings of this study offer guidance for managers to better undermine the negative effects of exploitative leadership.

Combinative aspects of leadership style and emotional intelligence,"Zhidong Li; Gupta, B.; Loon, M.; Casimir, G.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the leader’s emotional intelligence influences the leader’s preferences for different ways of combining leadership behaviors (i.e. combinative aspects of leadership style). Design/methodology/approach – The authors used a hybrid design to collect the data to avoid common-method biases. The authors described a high-stress workplace in a vignette and asked participants to rank four styles of combining a task-oriented leadership (i.e. Pressure) statement and a socio-emotional leadership (i.e. Support) statement. The authors then asked participants to complete a Likert-scale based questionnaire on emotional intelligence. Findings – The authors found that leaders who prefer to provide Support immediately before Pressure have higher levels of emotional intelligence than do leaders who prefer the three other combinative styles. Leaders who prefer to provide Pressure and Support separately (i.e. provide Pressure 30 minutes after Support) have the lowest levels of emotional intelligence. Research limitations/implications – A key implicit assumption in the work is that leaders do not want to evoke negative emotions in followers. The authors did not take into account factors that influence leadership style which participating managers would be likely to encounter on a daily basis such as the relationship with the follower, the follower’s level of performance and work experience, the gender of the leader and the gender of the follower, the hierarchical levels of the leader and follower, and the followers’ preferred combinative style. The nature of the sample and the use of a hypothetical scenario are other limitations of the study. Practical implications – Providing leadership behaviors that are regarded as effective is necessary but not enough because the emotional impact of leadership behaviors appears to also depend on how the behaviors are configured. Originality/value – This is the first study to show that the emotional intelligence of leaders is related to their preferences for the manner in which they combine task and social leadership statements.
