Can State Family Support Policies Level the Playing Field for Early-Career Women in Plastic Surgery? An Analysis of Web-Scraped Data,Smith R.; ; Karamitros G.; Furnas H.J.; Goulas S.,"BACKGROUND: For the young plastic surgeon, the quantity of first-author peer-reviewed publications plays a prominent role in job offers and promotions. Women surgeons carry a disproportionate share of family responsibilities, contributing to their lower representation in positions of leader- ship and influence. Policies protecting reproductive rights and mandating paid family leave (PFL) boost women's participation and productivity in the workplace. However, these policies vary by U.S., state and territory. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Web-scraped publication data from all PubMed-indexed plastic surgery journals from 2010 to 2022 were evaluated by first-author gender and affiliated state reproductive rights policy and PFL. Female first authors were further compared with men by publication output (1 article; >= 2; >= 5) by gender and by affiliated state policies. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Protective reproductive rights policies were associated with greater representation of female first authors (3.3 percentage points; p value = 0.003). Protective reproductive rights policies and PFL were associated with a decreased publication gender gap (0.13 articles, p value < 0.001, and 0.18 articles, p value < 0.001, respectively). Protective reproductive policies and PFL had an even greater correlation with higher publication output among female first authors. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Protective reproductive rights and mandatory PFL are not only correlated with women's representation among early-career researchers but with a reduction in the publication gender gap. Legislation and policies aimed at supporting women's family responsibilities are associated with higher research productivity among women and likely play a significant role in attracting more women to higher academic ranks and improving gender equity in professional success in plastic surgery.

When Taking Pay off the Table: A Qualitative Study of Gender Equity for Academic Leaders in the US Military,Schulz E.V.; ; Wyatt T.R.; Ma T.; Maggio L.A.,"INTRODUCTION: Although gender inequity persists globally in academic leadership positions, the United States Military has equitable pay and, in academic pediatrics, has equitable gender representation in leadership positions. To better understand how the US Military framework affects physician leaders, pediatricians were interviewed to illuminate the factors that facilitated their success and what barriers they faced in their career. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2022, following institutional review board approval, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 total participants (69% female, 31% male) serving as general pediatricians or pediatric subspecialists in the US Military. These pediatricians were in leadership positions of military academic medicine across seven graduate medical education (GME) sites. The interviews examined the leaders' perceptions of facilitators and barriers to their success. The authors analyzed the interviews using Acker's theory of gendered organizations as a theoretical framework, which explains embedded gender roles within work environments. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Drawing on the theory of gendered organizations, the authors identified that participants described several facilitators to their success, including the availability of mentorship/sponsorship, inclusive leadership, and early and persistent exposure to women leaders in GME training and beyond. Because medicine's ideal worker was normed around the traditional roles of men, men observed and women experienced barriers to leadership success around issues related to childbearing, maternity leave, and microaggressions. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study revealed that equitability for pediatric GME leadership in the military heavily relied on structures and support created by former leaders and mentors. Isolating these structures within a unique context of military academic medicine can illuminate physicians' experiences to address barriers and better support equitable leadership roles in both military and civilian academic medicine.<ovid:br/>Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2024.

Commitment to inclusion: The importance of collaboration in gender equity work,Lee J.K.; ; Levine R.B.; Yousem D.M.; Faraday N.; Skarupski K.A.; Ishii M.; Daugherty Biddison E.L.; Oliva-Hemker M.,"Despite decades of faculty professional development programs created to prepare women for leadership, gender inequities persist in salary, promotion, and leadership roles. Indeed, men still earn more than women, are more likely than women to hold the rank of professor, and hold the vast majority of positions of power in academic medicine. Institutions demonstrate commitment to their faculty's growth by investing resources, including creating faculty development programs. These programs are essential to help prepare women to lead and navigate the highly matrixed, complex systems of academic medicine. However, data still show that women persistently lag behind men in their career advancement and salary. Clearly, training women to adapt to existing structures and norms alone is not sufficient. To effectively generate organizational change, leaders with power and resources must commit to gender equity. This article describes several efforts by the Office of Faculty in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to broaden inclusivity in collaborative work for gender equity. The authors are women and men leaders in the Office of Faculty, which is within the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine dean's office and includes Women in Science and Medicine. Here, we discuss potential methods to advance gender equity using inclusivity based on our institutional experience and on the findings of other studies. Ongoing data collection to evaluate programmatic outcomes in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will be reported in the future.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.",2024,/,Women's Health,20,"(Lee, Levine, Yousem, Faraday, Skarupski, Ishii, Daugherty Biddison, Oliva-Hemker) Office of Faculty, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM), Baltimore, MD, United States(Lee, Faraday) Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine,",,2029840597,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17455057241252574,38742705,#3,Lee 2024,"",""
The Gender Wage Gap Among Early-Career Family Physicians,Sanders K.; ; Jabbarpour Y.; Phillips J.; Fleischer S.; Peterson L.E.,"Purpose: Numerous studies have documented salary differences between male and female physicians. For many specialties, this wage gap has been explored by controlling for measurable factors that influence pay such as productivity, work-life balance, and practice patterns. In family medicine where practice activities differ widely between physicians, it is important to understand what measurable factors may be contributing to the gender wage gap, so that employers and policymakers and can address unjust disparities. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used data from the 2017 to 2020 American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) National Graduate Survey (NGS) which is administered to family physicians 3 years after residency (n 1/4 8608; response rate 1/4 63.9%, 56.2% female). The survey collects clinical income and practice patterns. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed, which included variables on hours worked, degree type, principal professional activity, rural/urban, and region. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Although early-career family physician incomes averaged $225,278, female respondents reported incomes that were $43,566 (17%) lower than those of male respondents (P 1/4.001). Generally, female respondents tended toward lower-earning principal professional activities and US regions; worked fewer hours (2.9 per week); and tended to work more frequently in urban settings. However, in adjusted models, this gap in income only fell to $31,804 (13% lower than male respondents, P 1/4.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Even after controlling for measurable factors such as hours worked, degree type, principal professional activity, population density, and region, a significant wage gap persists. Interventions should be taken to eliminate gender bias in wage determinations for family physicians.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Board of Family Medicine.

Gender income differences among general practitioners with compulsory services in early career stage in underdeveloped areas: evidence from a prospective cohort study in China,Tang H.; ; Li M.; Zheng H.; Zhang X.; Liu X.,"BACKGROUND: Gender equality and the gender income gap in medicine are long-standing global problems. Although gender-related differences have been widely studied in developed countries, they remain unclear in underdeveloped regions. In 2010, China initiated a national compulsory service program (CSP) to train qualified general practitioners in rural and remote areas. This study aimed to evaluate gender income differences for early career CSP and non-CSP (NCSP) graduates in underdeveloped areas. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A cohort study was conducted with 3620 CSP and NCSP graduates from four medical universities in Central and Western China. Baseline surveys and six follow-up surveys were conducted between 2015 and 2022. Incomes, including monthly mean income and proportion of performance-based income, were measured as the key outcome variables. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify the gender income gap. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): NCSP graduates had higher average monthly incomes than CSP graduates. In the seventh year after graduation, the average monthly income for NCSP graduates was 7859 CNY while was 5379 CNY for CSP graduates. After controlling for demographic characteristics, the gender monthly income gap for CSP graduates was expanded from the fourth year (3.0%) to the sixth year (5.9%) after graduation, and that for NCSP graduates was expanded from the fifth year (11.9%) to the seventh year (16.3%) after graduation. Regarding performance-based income, it was 58.9% for NCSP graduates and 45.8% for CSP graduates in the seventh year after graduation. After controlling for performance-based income proportion, the gender income gap was reduced from 5.9 to 4.0% in the sixth year after graduation for CSP graduates, and from 16.3 to 14.4% for NCSP graduates in the seventh year after graduation. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): An extensive and ever-increasing gender income gap exists among young doctors in the early stages of their careers in underdeveloped areas of China. The high proportion of performance-based income among men is one of the main explanations for the observed difference. A more explicit compensation system must be established to enhance support for female health workers.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

From Exclusion to Glass Ceiling: A History of Women in Neonatal Medicine,Obladen M.; ,"The 21st century's medicine is predominantly female: two thirds of medical students now are women. In 375 BCE, Plato argued for equal education for male and female professions, explicitly physicians. In Greece and Rome, tombstones testify for patients' gratitude to women physicians. Christianization opened an era of female subordination. When universities established faculties of medicine during the 13th century, women were excluded and had no place where they could study medicine. Since 1850, female medical studies have been debated. Zurich admitted women from 1864, Paris from 1866. Up until the 1920s, treatment of newborns - especially preterm infants - was in the domain of obstetricians. When pediatricians accepted responsibility for sick newborns, women founded hospitals and public health facilities for infants. After WW2, women took leading roles in research. Their share within pediatrics increased from below 10% to above 60%. But they achieved less than 20% of full professor or chair positions in Europe and less than 35% in the US. Female neonatologists reached fewer positions in editorial boards, authorships, h-factors, keynote lectures, and research grants than did male colleagues. Women pediatricians earned 24% less than did male colleagues. When adjusted for labor force characteristics, the pay gap was still 13%. Women can augment their career chances by setting targets, seeking mentorship, and strengthening self-confidence. Women's careers should be effectively accelerated by institutional support: research offers, part-time work, paid research time, maternity/paternity leave, and support for childcare. Research-oriented neonatology cannot afford to lose female talents.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Authors.

Misconceptions about women in leadership in academic medicine,Hastie M.J.; ; Lee A.; Siddiqui S.; Oakes D.; Wong C.A.,"Despite progress made over the past decade, women are under-represented in positions of leadership in academic medicine. Women physicians face numerous challenges throughout their careers. Despite achieving leadership positions, women in leadership continue to experience the impact of those challenges. In this review, we describe four misconceptions about women in leadership, along with their impact and recommendations. First, we describe differences between mentorship and sponsorship, as well as their impact on attaining leadership positions. Second, the gender pay gap persists throughout women's careers, regardless of leadership positions. Third, we explore the role of self-efficacy in leadership in the context of stereotype threats. Fourth, gendered expectations of leadership characteristics place an undue burden on women, detracting from their leadership effectiveness. Organizations can address the challenges women face by creating robust mentorship and sponsorship networks, establishing transparent and equitable pay policies, promoting and normalizing a broader range of leadership styles, and improving work flexibility and support structure. Ultimately, such changes serve all members of the organization through increased retention and engagement.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.",2023,/,Canadian Journal of Anesthesia,70,6,1019EP  - 1025,2023240682,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12630-023-02458-7,37193865,#7,Hastie 2023,"",""
Factors shaping the gender wage gap among college-educated computer science workers,Sassler S.; ; Meyerhofer P.,"Encouraging women to pursue STEM employment is frequently touted as a means of reducing the gender wage gap. We examine whether the attributes of computer science workers-who account for nearly half of those working in STEM jobs-explain the persistent gender wage gap in computer science, using American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2009 to 2019. Our analysis focuses on working-age respondents between the ages of 22 and 60 who had a college degree and were employed full-time. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of logged wages on observed characteristics, before turning to regression decomposition techniques to estimate what proportion of the gender wage gap would remain if men and women were equally rewarded for the same attributes-such as parenthood or marital status, degree field, or occupation. Women employed in computer science jobs earned about 86.6 cents for every dollar that men earned-a raw gender gap that is smaller than it is for the overall labor force (where it was 82 percent). Controlling for compositional effects (family attributes, degree field and occupation) narrows the gender wage gap, though women continue to earn 9.1 cents per dollar less than their male counterparts. But differential returns to family characteristics and human capital measures account for almost two-thirds of the gender wage gap in computer science jobs. Women working in computer science receive both a marriage and parenthood premium relative to unmarried or childless women, but these are significantly smaller than the bonus that married men and fathers receive over their childless and unmarried peers. Men also receive sizable wage premiums for having STEM degrees in computer science and engineering when they work in computer science jobs, advantages that do not accrue to women. Closing the gender wage gap in computer science requires treating women more like men, not just increasing their representation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Public Library of Science.

Exploring Gender Bias in Six Key Domains of Academic Science: An Adversarial Collaboration,Ceci S.J.; ; Kahn S.; Williams W.M.,"We synthesized the vast, contradictory scholarly literature on gender bias in academic science from 2000 to 2020. In the most prestigious journals and media outlets, which influence many people's opinions about sexism, bias is frequently portrayed as an omnipresent factor limiting women's progress in the tenure-track academy. Claims and counterclaims regarding the presence or absence of sexism span a range of evaluation contexts. Our approach relied on a combination of meta-analysis and analytic dissection. We evaluated the empirical evidence for gender bias in six key contexts in the tenure-track academy: (a) tenure-track hiring, (b) grant funding, (c) teaching ratings, (d) journal acceptances, (e) salaries, and (f) recommendation letters. We also explored the gender gap in a seventh area, journal productivity, because it can moderate bias in other contexts. We focused on these specific domains, in which sexism has most often been alleged to be pervasive, because they represent important types of evaluation, and the extensive research corpus within these domains provides sufficient quantitative data for comprehensive analysis. Contrary to the omnipresent claims of sexism in these domains appearing in top journals and the media, our findings show that tenure-track women are at parity with tenure-track men in three domains (grant funding, journal acceptances, and recommendation letters) and are advantaged over men in a fourth domain (hiring). For teaching ratings and salaries, we found evidence of bias against women; although gender gaps in salary were much smaller than often claimed, they were nevertheless concerning. Even in the four domains in which we failed to find evidence of sexism disadvantaging women, we nevertheless acknowledge that broad societal structural factors may still impede women's advancement in academic science. Given the substantial resources directed toward reducing gender bias in academic science, it is imperative to develop a clear understanding of when and where such efforts are justified and of how resources can best be directed to mitigate sexism when and where it exists.",2023,/,Psychological science in the public interest : a journal of the American Psychological Society,24,1,15EP  - 73,641128950,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15291006231163179,37098793,#9,Ceci 2023,"",""
Equal Pay for Equal Work in the Dean Suite: Addressing Occupational Gender Segregation and Compensation Inequities Among Medical School Leadership,Gottlieb A.S.; ; Dandar V.M.; Lautenberger D.M.; Best C.; Jagsi R.,"In 2022, the Association of American Medical Colleges published data from its annual Dean's Office Staff Compensation and Dean's Compensation Surveys in a new report addressing salary equity among medical school leadership. These data, disaggregated by gender and race/ethnicity, represent earnings of the senior most leaders in the dean suite and have historically been shared only with medical school Deans and principal business officers. The report shows that the highest-ranking decanal positions in U.S. medical schools are filled along the lines of traditional gender stereotypes (with men in clinical affairs and research affairs deanships and women in admissions, diversity affairs, faculty affairs, and student affairs deanships) and that the roles held mostly by men carry grander titles (e.g., senior associate dean vs assistant dean) and significantly higher salaries than those typically held by women. Additionally, within the same decanal positions, women earn lower median compensation than men. In this commentary, the authors describe limited advancement and lower compensation as foregone conclusions for women in medicine and science due to a professional model that places a premium on activities traditionally pursued by men. They define and characterize the impact of this occupational gender segregation in the dean suite and offer a roadmap for an alternative value system that recognizes complementary leadership activities across the mission areas of academic medicine and ensures that the contributions of women in the profession are appropriately recognized, valued, and rewarded.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2023,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,98,3,296EP  - 299,639792152,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000005087,36512834,#10,Gottlieb 2023,"",""
Early-Career Compensation Trends Among Family Physicians,Sanders K.; ; Phillips J.; Fleischer S.; Peterson L.E.,"Purpose: Family medicine incomes are often cited as a key reason for shortages of family physicians. The purpose of this study was to identify family physician income trends and to test how income varies among early-career family physicians. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used data from the 2016 to 2020 American Board of Family Medicine National Graduate Survey (NGS) collected from early-career family physicians (n = 9566; response rate = 63.9%). The NGS asked practice income, practice activities, practice site, and setting. We performed an income trend analysis and conducted multivariate regression to test for associations of personal and workplace characteristics with income. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Average income across the full sample of early-career family physicians (after inflation adjustments) was $224,292. Overall, income growth outpaced inflation from 2016 to 2020. There are significant differences in income based on personal and work characteristics, and income growth varied dramatically. Notably, women respondents reported earnings of $33,522 below those of men respondents in adjusted models. In addition, the incomes of several groups lagged behind inflation, including those practicing geriatrics (-0.67%), employed by the Indian Health Service (-1.72%), and respondents who identified as Black or African American (-0.85%). Greatest increases in inflationadjusted incomes were observed among those in palliative care (4.61%) and at nonfederal government clinics (4.46%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Though income is only one factor physicians consider in deciding where and how to work, it is concerning to see lower incomes among groups that traditionally experience shortages (eg, geriatrics and government-associated practice sites).

Basic Income and the Status of Women in an Established Gender-Equal Welfare State: Results from the Finnish Basic Income Experiment,Kangas O.; ; Ylikanno M.,"Debates on the gendered effects of universal basic income (UBI) tend to bifurcate into two opposing views. On the one hand, UBI is seen as a strong incentive for women to stay at home and be permanently locked into their care responsibilities. On the other hand, UBI is seen as a tool for empowerment, increasing women's autonomy, fortifying their capacity to act, and guaranteeing their individual income and income security. This paper contributes to these debates by asking if UBI enhances women's empowerment or not. Using the survey data compiled in the context of the Finnish basic income experiment (2017-2018), we compare survey responses from the UBI treatment group (n = 586) and the control group (n = 1047). Our results based on chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> statistics and regression analyses show that, while UBI did not affect employment, it was positively associated with individual capacities and confidence in various aspects of life. However, these empowering effects were universal and did not differ between women and men. Our results indicate that UBI is not a gender equality-related issue in established gender-equal Nordic welfare states. On the basis of our findings, we also argue that the previous academic discussion on UBI and on results from various experiments is too universalising. It does not pay sufficient attention to the national social policy contexts where experiments have been carried out.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 by the authors.",2023,/,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,20,3,1733,2021562788,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20031733,36767105,#12,Kangas 2023,"",non-US
Priority strategies to improve gender equity in Canadian emergency medicine: proceedings from the CAEP 2021 Academic Symposium on leadership,McIlveen-Brown E.; ; Morris J.; Lim R.; Johnson K.; Byrne A.; Bischoff T.; Hurley K.; Mann M.; Menchetti I.; Pardhan A.; Pham C.; Sheppard G.; Zia A.; Chan T.M.,"Objectives: Gender inequities are deeply rooted in our society and have significant negative consequences. Female physicians experience numerous gender-related inequities (e.g., microaggressions, harassment, violence). These inequities have far-reaching consequences on health, well-being and career longevity and may result in the devaluing of various strengths that female emergency physicians bring to the table. This, in turn, has an impact on patient healthcare experience and outcomes. During the 2021 Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) Academic Symposium, a national collaborative sought to understand gender inequities in emergency medicine in Canada. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used a multistep stakeholder-engagement-based approach (harnessing both quantitative and qualitative methods) to identify and prioritize problems with gender equity in emergency medicine in Canada. Based on expert consultation and literature review, we developed recommendations to effect change for the higher priority problems. We then conducted a nationwide consultation with the Canadian emergency medicine community via online engagement and the CAEP Academic Symposium to ensure that these priority problems and solutions were appropriate for the Canadian context. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Via the above process, 15 recommendations were developed to address five unique problem areas. There is a dearth of research in this important area and we hope this preliminary work will serve as a starting point to fuel further research.

Recent literature assessing this impact supports equivalent or superior medical and surgical outcomes for women surgeons and physicians. It also reveals superior counseling and communication styles as perceived by patients. However, women in medicine receive lower patient ratings in competence, medical knowledge, and technical skills despite the existing evidence.

Association Between Workforce Gender Distribution and Lifetime Earning Potential in the Pediatric Subspecialties,Catenaccio E.; ; Rochlin J.M.; Simon H.K.,"Objective: Examine the relationship between the gender distribution of the pediatric subspecialty workforce and lifetime earning potential. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We estimated lifetime earning potential for pediatric academic subspecialists using mean debt and compensation data from national physician surveys for 2019 to 2020 and examined the relationship between the workforce gender composition and lifetime earning potential across the pediatric subspecialties using linear regression analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Subspecialties with a higher proportion of women had lower lifetime earning potential (-$55,215 in lifetime earning potential/1% increase in the percentage of female subspecialists; P value .002, 95% CI -$24,429 to -$86,000).

Lower earning subspecialties also tended to train higher proportions of women, suggesting that this trend may worsen over time as pediatrics in general and individual subspecialties in particular become increasingly female predominant.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Academic Pediatric Association",2022,/,Academic Pediatrics,22,7,1153EP  - 1157,2018254152,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2022.02.012,35219852,#15,Catenaccio 2022,"",""

Gender differences in medical errors among older patients and inequalities in medical compensation compared with younger adults,Liu P.; ; Yang Y.; Cheng J.,"Background: Despite growing evidence focusing on health inequalities in older adults, inequalities in medical compensation compared with younger adults and gender disparities of medical errors among older patients have received little attention. This study aimed to disclose the aforementioned inequalities and examine the disparities in medical errors among older patients. <ovid:br/>Method(s): First, available litigation documents were searched on ""China Judgment Online"" using keywords including medical errors. Second, we compiled a database with 5,072 disputes. After using systematic random sampling to retain half of the data, we removed 549 unrelated cases. According to the age, we identified 424 and 1,563 cases related to older and younger patients, respectively. Then, we hired two frontline physicians to review the documents and independently judge the medical errors and specialties involved. A third physician further considered the divergent results. Finally, we compared the medical compensation between older and younger groups and medical errors and specialties among older patients. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Older patients experienced different medical errors in divergent specialties. The medical error rate of male older patients was over 4% higher than that of females in the departments of general surgery and emergency. Female older patients were prone to adverse events in respiratory medicine departments and primary care institutes. The incidence of insufficient implementation of consent obligation among male older patients was 5.18% higher than that of females. However, females were more likely to suffer adverse events at the stages of diagnosis, therapy, and surgical operation. The total amount of medical compensation obtained by younger patients was 41.47% higher than that of older patients. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Except for the common medical errors and departments involved, additional attention should be paid to older patients of different genders according to the incidence of medical errors. Setting up the department of geriatrics or specialist hospitals is also an important alternative to improve patient safety for older people. Furthermore, there may be inequality in medical compensation in older patients due to the tort liability law of China.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Liu, Yang and Cheng.",2022,/,Frontiers in public health,10,"(Liu) School of Public Administration, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China(Yang) School of Government, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China(Cheng) School of Public Administration and Emergency Management, Jinan University,",883822,639225638,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.883822,36211673,#17,Liu 2022,"",""
The Financial Implications of Being a Female Fellow: Does Another Year Help Close the Gap?,Ansert E.; ; Rushing C.J.,"In 2018, the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons Compensation and Benefits Survey illustrated a wage gap between male and female doctors of podiatric medicine in the United States. The purpose of the present study was to assess if an additional year of fellowship training closes that gap. To calculate the net present value, weighted mean general income data from female doctors of podiatric medicine with and without fellowship training was obtained. Demographic and clinical income data (based on 2080 hours) for 17 female graduates from 14 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons recognized fellowship programs was collected using an anonymous online survey. Income from general payments was collected from manual searches of Open Source Payments. Socioeconomic data from the 2018 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons compensation and benefits survey was used to calculate the net present value of the nonfellowship trained doctors of podiatric medicine for comparison. Overall, the net present value of female doctors of podiatric medicine with and without fellowship training was $1.91 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The comparative net present value and cumulative net income difference over 30 years for female doctors of podiatric medicine with and without fellowships was -$492,159.00 and -$820,000.00, respectively. The mean comparative income difference for fellowship trained female doctors of podiatric medicine annually was as follows: clinical (-$26,082.00) and general (+$1101.54). Based on the data, with consideration to the limitations of the study, the financial implications of fellowship on the gender wage gap is currently unclear.

The gender earnings gap in medicine: Evidence from Canada,Kralj B.; ; O'Toole D.; Vanstone M.; Sweetman A.,"Despite the gender gap in physician earnings being of concern to many in Canada, its existence is far from universally accepted and there are no studies covering all physicians/regions or addressing earnings rather than billings. This may explain the lack of serious consideration or remedial action by medical associations and governments in negotiations, or tariff and compensation processes. Our study employs 2016 Canadian Census data linked to Canada Revenue Agency taxation records. Rather than focusing on gross billings, we model physician net earnings (after overhead expenses and controlling for hours/weeks of work) including dividends from corporations. Using OLS, and unconditional quantile regression to document the gap across the earnings distribution, we observe that Canadian female physicians, on average, earn 9.3% less than their male counterparts. The average adjusted gap is slightly smaller for family physicians (8.5%) than other specialists (10.2%). Beyond averages, at the top of the income distribution the gap is double that at the median for both family physicians and other specialists. The gap also varies across provinces, from 6.6% in Quebec to 19.8% in Manitoba. Although our results yield somewhat smaller estimates than those from studies using billings/self-reported income, the magnitudes remain appreciable. The findings substantiate the claim that the gender pay gap in Canadian medicine is pervasive.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,/,Health Policy,126,10,1002EP  - 1009,2019845163,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2022.08.007,35995639,#19,Kralj 2022,"",""

Sex Differences in Salaries of Academic Ophthalmologists in the United States,Emami-Naeini P.; ; Lieng M.K.; Chen J.,"Importance: Representation of women in medicine and ophthalmology has increased in recent years. However, substantial inequities still exist between salaries for male and female physicians. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To evaluate the status of disparities in compensation among US academic ophthalmologists and compare compensation across specialties. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional study analyzed data for full-time academic physicians practicing in 154 accredited US medical schools. Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Salary Report for fiscal year 2019-2020 were used to evaluate disparities in total compensation for female and male academic ophthalmologists. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Median total compensation for female and male ophthalmologists in fiscal year 2019-2020. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Female academic ophthalmologists were paid a mean of $50300 (95% CI, $4600-$96000) less than their male counterparts.

Salary disparities based on gender in academic emergency medicine leadership,Wiler J.L.; ; Wendel S.K.; Rounds K.; McGowan B.; Baird J.,"Objective: There are significantly fewer women than men in leadership roles in health care. Previous studies have shown that, overall, male physicians earn nearly $20,000 more annually than their female physician colleagues after adjusting for confounding factors. However, there has not been a description of physician leadership compensation in relation to gender. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a successive cross-sectional observation study design of 154 emergency departments in the United States from 5 years (2013, 2015-2018) using Association of Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine and Academy of Administrators in Academic EM survey data. The primary variable of interest, leadership role, was attained by recoding the survey responses to assign primary job duty into four main categories: no leadership role, operations leadership, education leadership, and executive leadership. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Overall, 8820 responses were included. Across all survey years, the mean (+/-SD) percentage of women in any leadership role was significantly less than men (44.5% [95% CI: 42.8, 46.2%] vs. 55.3% [95% CI: 54.1, 56.5%]). Women in leadership roles worked more clinical hours than men in the same position (female median = 1008, male median = 960). Women also had significantly lower salaries than men at each of the 5-year time points that data are reported, with unadjusted mean salary differences of -$54,409 per year for executives, -$27,803 for operational leaders, and -$17,803 for education leaders. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female physicians hold fewer leadership roles in academic emergency medicine (EM), and when they do, they work more clinical hours and are paid less than male physicians.

Design A web-based retrospective review of salary for professors in 2016. Setting Faculty from six state-run, publicly funded academic medical centres in the Western USA. Participants 799 faculty members, 225 assistant (51% women), 200 associate (40% women) and 374 full professors (32% women) from general surgery (26% women), obstetrics and gynaecology (70% women) and radiology (34% women). Methods Archived online faculty profiles were reviewed for gender, rank and compensation (total, baseline and supplemental). Total compensation was defined as baseline compensation plus supplemental income. Baseline compensation was defined as base salary minus reductions due to participation in the voluntary Employee Reduction in Time and phased retirement programmes. Supplemental income was defined as additional salary for clinical care and research (eg, grants). Elsevier's Scopus was used to collect data on h-index, a measure of research productivity. Linear regression models were estimated to determine the relationship between these factors and salary. Results Total compensation was significantly higher for men across all professorial ranks in both general surgery (R2=0.159,F(4,299)=14.123,p<0.01) and obstetrics and gynaecology (R2=0.068,F(4,174)=3.172,p<0.05). Women faculty members within these departments earned almost US$75 000 less than their men colleagues. The disparity in salary originates from gaps in supplemental income, as baseline compensation was not significantly different between men and women. No significant gender difference in total compensation for radiology was found (R2=0.01,F(4,266)=0.591,n.s.). Higher h-index was associated with higher baseline compensation across all departments as well as with supplemental income for general surgery.

Data analysis was performed from March to May 2021. Exposures: Gender and subspecialty. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Starting salary, annual salary growth rate, year-10 salary, and earning potential in first 10 years of employment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): This cross-sectional study included compensation data from 24593 female and 29886 male academic physicians across 45 subspecialties. Women had lower starting salaries in 42 of 45 subspecialties (93%), year-10 salaries in 43 of 45 subspecialties (96%), mean annual salary growth rates in 22 of 45 subspecialties (49%), and earning potential in 43 of 45 subspecialties (96%) (median [IQR], $214440 [$130423-$384954], or 10%, less). A 1-year delay in promotion from assistant to associate professor reduced women's earning potential by a median (IQR) of $26042 ($19672-$35671), but failure to be promoted at all reduced it by a median (IQR) of $218724 ($176317-$284466). Equalizing starting salaries could increase women's earning potential by a median (IQR) of $250075 ($161299-$381799) in the subspecialties for which starting salaries for women were lower than those for men.

The gender pay gap in medicine: A systematic review,Hoff T.; ; Lee D.R.,"BACKGROUND: Women are becoming doctors in greater numbers. Despite this, there is evidence of female doctors' continued differential treatment compared to their male counterparts. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review systematically the extant literature on the gender-based pay gap in medicine across time, different medical specialties, and different countries of clinical practice. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Systematic search of three databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies needed to be empirical and contain either an unadjusted or adjusted gender-based finding related to pay. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 46 articles published since 2000 contained a gender-based finding related to physician pay. Thirty-two of these 46 articles presented either adjusted or unadjusted means comparisons (or both) comparing pay between male and female physicians. Eighteen of the 46 articles controlled for one or more variables in examining pay between the two groups. Across almost all studies, female doctors earn significantly less than men, often tens of thousands of dollars less annually, despite similar demographic and work-related profiles. This earnings gap is persistent across time, medical specialty, and country of practice. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The gender-based pay gap is an ongoing crisis within medicine that must be addressed. From a practice perspective, women physicians may benefit from greater organizational awareness of potential workplace bias and the implementation of more supportive policies aimed at better equalizing compensation through greater support and transparency related to salary negotiations, promotional opportunities, and pay scales across various job titles.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

An examination of the magnitude of pay disparities could inform strategies for remediation. OBJECTIVE To examine gender-based differences in pay within a large, comprehensive physician population practicing within a variety of payment systems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) in the 2017 to 2018 fiscal year to estimate differences in gross payments between men and women physicians in Ontario, Canada. Pay gaps were calculated annually and daily. Regression analyses were used to control for observable practice characteristics that could account for individual differences in daily pay. In Canada's largest province, Ontario, medical services are predominantly provided by self-employed physicians who bill the province's single payer, OHIP. All physicians who submitted claims to OHIP were included. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to July 2021. EXPOSURES Physician gender, obtained from the OHIP Corporate Provider Database. Gender is recorded as male or female. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Gross clinical payments were tabulated for individual physicians on a daily and annual basis in conjunction with each physician's practice characteristics, setting, and specialty. RESULTS A total of 31 481 physicians were included in the study sample (12 604 [40.0%] women; 18 877 [60.0%] men; mean [SD] time since graduation, 23.3 [13.6] years), representing 99% of active physicians in Ontario. The unadjusted differences in clinical payments between male and female physicians were 32.8% (95% CI, 30.8%-34.6%) annually and 22.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-23.8%) daily. After accounting for practice characteristics, region, and specialty, the overall daily payment gap was 13.5% (95% CI, 12.3%-14.8%). The pay gap persisted with differing magnitudes when examined by specialty (ranging from 6.6% to 37.6%), practice setting (8.3% to 17.2%), payment model (13.4% to 22.8% for family medicine; 8.0% to 11.6% for other specialties), and rurality (8.0% to 16.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study examined differences in magnitude of annual and daily payment gaps and between unadjusted and adjusted gaps. Comparing the gaps for different specialties, geography, and payment systems illustrated the complexity of the issue by showing that the pay gap varied for physicians in different practice settings.

Here, we analyze the typical barriers for women as doctors in cardiology and point to issues that make the discipline less attractive for both genders. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a cross-sectional study, a standardized online questionnaire was sent to 3873 members of the German Cardiac Society (DGK). Answers from 567 (278 women, 289 men) were analyzed, using comparisons between groups, correlation analyses, and tests of normal distribution. <ovid:br/>Result(s): For 47.4% of respondents (52.0%, of women; 42.8%, of men; p = 0.049), training had lasted longer than anticipated. Average monthly gross income (full-time work) differed significantly between women and men as specialists (p = 0.004) and assistant doctors (p = 0.030). Of women, 32.1% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The main arguments against a career in university medicine were an extremely competitive working climate (66.7% of women, 63.2% of men), lack of work-life balance (66.7% women, 55.3% men), and excessive workload (57.8% women, 62.5% men). As strategies to increase job attractiveness, both mentioned measures to improve the work-life balance, and the flexibility of working times and improved financial provision. Women asked for gender balance at management level (76.3% vs. 32.9% of men) and opportunities for sharing management tasks (82.4% vs. 57.9%). Flatter hierarchies were requested by more men (67.1 vs. 54.8%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Further development of the work culture in cardiology seems necessary. In order to increase the attractiveness of the field overall and to provide equal opportunities in cardiology, more targeted support should be provided to young doctors and more flexibility introduced into work.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2021,/,Herz,46,2,150EP  - 157,2010529892,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00059-021-05027-0,33599803,#34,Dettmer 2021,"",""
Towards gender equity in emergency medicine: a position statement from the CAEP Women in Emergency Medicine committee,Sheppard G.; ; Pham C.; Nowacki A.; Bischoff T.; Snider C.,"As of January 2019, over half of all doctors working in Canada under the age of 40 were women. Despite equal representation in the profession of medicine, women still experience harassment, discrimination, and pay inequity when compared to their male colleagues. Gender discrimination is present at all levels of medical training and negatively impacts women who want to become emergency physicians. The right to gender equity is part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The World Health Organization states that ""gender inequities are socially generated and, therefore, can be changed."" CAEP recognizes that gender equity is important to its members and that it intersects with inequities experienced by other minority groups. This position statement from the committee for Women in Emergency Medicine (EM) is intended to support women and those who identify as women who have chosen EM as their career. Furthermore, it is meant to inform and support policy makers as they consider the unique challenges that women face in their pursuit of excellence in EM.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP)/ Association Canadienne de Medecine d'Urgence (ACMU).",2021,/,Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine,23,4,455EP  - 459,2010769839,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43678-021-00114-x,33709250,#35,Sheppard 2021,"",""
"She's going to sue-20 years after Dr. Brodsky's pay equity lawsuit, the gender gap wages",Flanary V.A.; ; Chandrasekhar S.S.; Bradford C.R.; Yaremchuk K.,"Session Description: In 2001 Dr. Linda Brodsky successfully sued the State University of New York at Buffalo for pay inequity in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and for retaliation because she complained. 'Winning' resulted in some financial restitution, but the personal repercussions from pursuing legal action were significant, and, 20 years later, our specialty continues to see salary and career advancement inequity for women and others that are underrepresented in medicine. In 2020 women physicians made less than men in all medical specialties, but the gender salary gap was the largest in otolaryngology, where women make 77.9% of what men earn (22.1% wage gap), and the gap was higher than in the previous year. There are many contributors to this gender gap, including various remuneration models, unfair distribution of procedures, and unrecompensed roles. These can be deliberate or arise from common misconceptions; they will be discussed and debunked. Institutional and departmental strategies for transparency and opportunities to gain equity will be discussed by legal, human resource experts, and women otolaryngology leaders with stories to tell. Diversity, inclusion, and equity should not just be the buzz words of the time. Acting deliberately to shape our workforce so that it represents our patients and draws from varying experiences is the way to strengthen our specialty. Outcome Objectives: (1) Discover current data surrounding gender wage gap in medical specialties. (2) Know Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 protect against retaliation for complaining about pay inequity.

Has a critical mass of women resulted in gender equity in gynecologic surgery?,Heisler C.A.; ; Mark K.; Ton J.; Miller P.; Temkin S.M.,"Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women. Policies related to pregnancy and parenting may disproportionately affect the careers of women gynecologists.

Pediatric physiatrists who identified as women were more likely to work part-time but were demographically similar to their colleagues who identified as men. The odds of having no leadership role were higher for women (odds ratio=2.17; P=.02) than men. Pediatric physiatrists who identified as men made on average (in US dollars +/- SD) 244,798+/-52,906 annually compared with those who identified as women 224,497+/-60,756. The average annual difference in full-time salary was $20,311 in favor of those who identified as men (95% confidence interval, $3135-$37,486).

Work effort and the physician gender pay gap: Evidence from primary care,Ganguli I.; ; Sheridan B.; Gray J.; Chernew M.E.; Rosenthal M.; Neprash H.,"BACKGROUND: Female physicians are a growing share of the workforce and may achieve better patient outcomes, yet they are paid less than their male counterparts. This persistent wage gap is often attributed in part to women having lower work effort, but evidence-to-date is largely limited by self-report and lack of detail on clinical revenue and known gender differences in practice style. We used a novel database to understand revenue differences by physician gender in primary care. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Using a national sample of all-payer claims and electronic health record (EHR) data from athenahealth, we conducted a crosssectional analysis of 16.3 million office visits in 2017 by primary care physicians (PCPs; internal medicine, family practice, or general practice specialty). Our primary predictor was physician gender and our primary outcomes were visit count, visit revenue, and observed visit length (using EHR time stamps). We estimated multivariate regression models at the annual, day, and visit level adjusting for physician characteristics (age, credential, specialty, clinic sessions per week), patient characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, chronic condition count, payer, newto- physician (defined as no prior visit with that PCP since 2011)), and practice fixed effects. We then stratified results by physician age and patient gender and performed subgroup analyses of visits for patients with 2 or more medical conditions and of specific types (same-day, problembased vs preventive, established vs new patient) and complexity levels (defined by billing code). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Compared to male PCPs in the same practices, female PCPs were younger and worked the same number of sessions per week. Patients seen by female PCPs were more likely to be below age 65, female, nonwhite, and covered by Medicaid or commercial insurance. In 2017, female PCPs earned 10.7% ($38,577) less visit revenue than male PCPs in the same practices and conducted 10.6% (323.9) fewer visits over 2.6% (5.4) fewer clinic days, yet spent 3.6% (1,470.2 minutes) more observed visit time in the year. Per visit, female PCPs earned equal revenue but documented 5.5% (0.2) more diagnoses, placed 11.6% (0.5) more orders, and spent 15.2% (2.8 minutes) longer with each patient. These results were consistent in subgroup analyses by patient gender and health status and by visit type and complexity. Over the year, the gender revenue gap was largest among older physicians (aged 65+ years vs 25-44 or 45-64) while the difference in observed time was largest among the youngest physicians (25-44). All differences were statistically significant at p<0.001. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Female PCPs earned 11% less visit revenue than male PCPs in the same practice due to conducting fewer visits yet spent 4% more time in direct patient care per year.

The primary variable of interest was the adjusted base salary, calculated to be the full-time effort of the physician without any enhancements (e.g., without stipend, release time, extra hours). Institutional predictive variables included U.S. region that ED was in and if the site was an academic or community academic hybrid (""community"") ED. Individual level variables included gender, academic rank, years at academic rank, years at rank within the ED, and primary duty (clinical or other). A series of Wilcoxon tests were conducted to determine if the unadjusted difference in salaries by gender for each year of the survey were significantly different. The effects of relative change in adjusted base salary over time were assessed using a mixed-effects regression model, with institutional- and individual-level predictors included in the model. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Data were provided by 81 departments across the four geographic regions of the United States (Northeast, South, West, and Midwest). Most of the survey respondents across the four time periods of administration were male (65%) and reported primary clinical appointments at an academic ED (94%). Overall salaries increased across the four time points of the data with an overall relative 10.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.6%-12%) change in median salary between 2013 and 2017; the relative percentage change for female respondents was 10.6% (95% CI = 9.4%-11.85%) and 11.1% (95% CI = 10.2%-12%) for males.

What explains wage differences between male and female Brazilian physicians A cross-sectional nationwide study,Mainardi G.M.; ; Cassenote A.J.F.; Guilloux A.G.A.; Miotto B.A.; Scheffer M.C.,"Objective In many countries an increase in the number of women in medicine is accompanied by gender inequality in various aspects of professional practice. Women in medical workforce usually earn less than their male counterparts. The aim of this study was to describe the gender wage difference and analyse the associated factors in relation to Brazil's physicians. Participants 2400 physicians. Setting Nationwide, cross-sectional study conducted in 2014. Methods Data were collected via a telephone enquiry. Sociodemographic and work characteristics were considered factors, and monthly wages (only the monthly earnings based on a medical profession) were considered as the primary outcome. A hierarchical multiple regression model was used to study the factors related to wage differences between male and female physicians. The adjustment of different models was verified by indicators of residual deviance and the Akaike information criterion. Analysis of variance was used to verify the equality hypothesis subsequently among the different models. Results The probability of men receiving the highest monthly wage range is higher than women for all factors. Almost 80% of women are concentrated in the three lowest wage categories, while 51% of men are in the three highest categories. Among physicians working between 20 and 40 hours a week, only 2.7% of women reported receiving >US10 762 per month, compared with 13% of men. After adjustment for work characteristics in the hierarchical multiple regression model, the gender variable estimations (s) remained, with no significant modifications. The final effect of this full model suggests that the probability of men receiving the highest salary level (>=US10 762) is 17.1%, and for women it is 4.1%. Results indicate that a significant gender wage difference exists in Brazil. Conclusion The inequality between sexes persisted even after adjusting for working factors such as weekly workload, number of weekly on-call shifts, physician office work, length of practice and specialisation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Job Negotiations in Academic Medicine: Building a Competency-Based Roadmap for Residents and Fellows,Berman R.A.; ; Gottlieb A.S.,"Negotiation skills are critical to career success, yet many physicians feel ill-equipped to negotiate for professional opportunities. Enhancing competencies in this arena may be especially critical for women and underrepresented minorities to reduce disparities in compensation and resources that begin upon entry into the workforce as junior faculty. This perspective offers a comprehensive overview of negotiation strategies and the job search process for individuals finishing medical training and seeking first-time employment. First, we extrapolate lessons from clinical medicine to provide a negotiation roadmap for residents and fellows. We use both a clinical and an employment scenario to illustrate the concept of principled negotiation in which negotiating partners elicit each other's values and interests and identify options for mutual gain. We then describe approaches to seeking and negotiating job opportunities and discuss typical timelines for these activities. We supply a list of professional needs to consider before a negotiation begins and introduce the concept of a best alternative to negotiated agreement to help ensure essential requirements are met in a final employment offer. Finally, we explore the utility of third-party assistance and published benchmarks and offer best practices for negotiating.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018, Society of General Internal Medicine.",2019,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,34,1,146EP  - 149,624172717,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4632-2,30276658,#49,Berman 2019,"",""
Gender disparity in ICU staffing in Argentina,Estenssoro E.; ; Loudet C.I.; Reina R.; Fernandez A.; Vidal M.G.,"Purpose: Gender disparities in healthcare are striking, notwithstanding an increase in female students and physicians. Underrepresentation of women in leadership positions is well-documented; however, information from low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is still sparse. The Argentinian Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SATI) aimed to characterize the gender composition in Argentine ICUs. <ovid:br/>Methods and Results: Between 8/1/2018 and 1/1/2019, 131 questionnaires were submitted to ICU Department Chairs of SATI research networks. Gender distribution of the different staffing levels, board certification and hospital characteristics were recorded. One-hundred and four were completed, including 2186 physicians; 44% were female. Female participation decreased with highest responsibility: only 23% of Department Chairs were female (P = .002 vs. the rest of the staffing categories, adjusted for multiple comparisons). Residents exhibited the highest proportion of female physicians (47%). Board certification was similar for both sexes (62.3% vs. 62.2%, P = .97). Female/male distribution in public and private hospitals was 47%/53% and 40/60% (P < .01), respectively. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our data provide evidence of an important gender gap in ICU management in a LMIC. Women were poorly represented in the leadership positions, although qualifications were similar to men. Moreover, female physicians worked more frequently in the public health subsector, usually underfinanced in LMICs-a surrogate of a gender pay gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2019,/,Journal of Critical Care,53,"(Estenssoro, Loudet, Reina, Vidal) Servicio de Terapia Intensiva, Hospital Interzonal de Agudos San Martin de La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina(Fernandez) Servicio de Terapia Intensiva Pediatrica, Hospital de Agudos Carlos D.

Compensation of Otolaryngologists in the Veterans Health Administration: Is There a Gender Gap?,Dermody S.M.; ; Litvack J.R.; Randall J.A.; Malekzadeh S.; Maxwell J.H.,"Objectives/Hypothesis: To determine if gender pay disparity exists amongst otolaryngologists employed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). <ovid:br/>Study Design: cross-sectional analysis. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Board-certified otolaryngologists employed at all complex Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) in 2016 were identified. Salaries were collated using the Enterprise Human Resources Integration-Statistical Data Mart dataset. Additional variables, including gender, years since medical school graduation, professorship status, h-index, and geographic location were collected. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed where salary was the primary outcome of interest and gender was accounted for as an independent predictor while controlling for professional characteristics, geographic location, and seniority. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sixty-nine VHA surgical programs with an operative designation of ""complex"" were identified. Two hundred sixty board-certified otolaryngologists, including 197 (75.8%) men and 63 (24.2%) women, were identified. Salary data were available on 210 of these otolaryngologists. In 2016, the mean salary for male and female otolaryngologists was not significantly different ($266,707 +/- $31,624 vs. $264,674 +/- $27,027, P =.918) nor were salaries in early career ($243,979 +/- $31,749 vs. $254,625 +/- $24,558, respectively; P =.416). On multivariate linear regression analysis, number of years since graduation (P =.009) and h-index (P =.049) were independent predictors of salary, but gender, geographic location, and faculty rank were not. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although the gender pay gap persists in many areas of medicine and surgery, otolaryngologists employed at complex VAMCs do not experience gender pay disparity. The use of specific and objective criteria to establish and adjust salaries can reduce and potentially eliminate gender pay disparity.

Association of a Simulated Institutional Gender Equity Initiative with Gender-Based Disparities in Medical School Faculty Salaries and Promotions,Rao A.D.; ; Nicholas S.E.; Kachniarz B.; Hu C.; Redmond K.J.; Deville C.; Wright J.L.; Page B.R.; Terezakis S.; Viswanathan A.N.; Deweese T.L.; Fivush B.A.; Alcorn S.R.,"Importance: Despite progress in narrowing gender-based salary gaps, notable disparities persist in the scientific community. The significance of pay difference may be underestimated, with little data evaluating its effect on lifetime wealth after accounting for factors like time to promotion and savings. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To characterize gender disparities in salary and assess the outcomes associated with a gender equity initiative (GEI). <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Quality improvement study with simulations of salary and additional accumulated wealth (AAW) using retrospectively reviewed Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine annual salary and promotion data. All academic faculty were included in the faculty salary analysis from 2005 (n = 1481) and 2016 (n = 1885). <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Salary and longitudinal promotion data from 2005 to 2016 were used to estimate gender-based differences in salary and time to promotion. The effect of these differences on total salary and AAW, including retirement and salary-based investments, was simulated for a representative male and female faculty member over a 30-year career in 3 scenarios: (1) pre-GEI, (2) post-GEI, and (3) in real time for GEI, beginning with and progressing through these initiatives. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Analyses of salaries of 1481 faculty (432 women) in 2005 and 1885 faculty (742 women) in 2016 revealed that a decade after GEI implementation, the overall mean (SE) salary gap by gender decreased from -2.6% (1.2%) (95% CI, -5.6% to -0.3%) to -1.9% (1.1%) (95% CI, -4.1% to 0.3%). Simulation of pre-GEI disparities correlated with male faculty collecting an average lifetime AAW of $501416 more than the equivalent woman, with disparities persisting past retirement. The AAW gap decreased to $210829 in the real-time GEI simulation and to $66104 using post-GEI conditions, reflecting success of GEI efforts. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: Even small gender-based salary gaps are associated with substantial differences in lifetime wealth, but an institutional commitment to achieving equitable promotion and compensation for women can appreciably reduce these disparities.

Sex differences in physician salary in US public medical schools,Jena A.B.; ; Olenski A.R.; Blumenthal D.M.,"Importance Limited evidence exists on salary differences between male and female academic physicians, largely owing to difficulty obtaining data on salary and factors influencing salary. Existing studies have been limited by reliance on survey-based approaches to measuring sex differences in earnings, lack of contemporary data, small sample sizes, or limited geographic representation. Objective To analyze sex differences in earnings among US academic physicians. Design, Setting, and Participants Freedom of Information laws mandate release of salary information of public university employees in several states. In 12 states with salary information published online, salary data were extracted on 10 241 academic physicians at 24 public medical schools. These data were linked to a unique physician database with detailed information on sex, age, years of experience, faculty rank, specialty, scientific authorship, National Institutes of Health funding, clinical trial participation, and Medicare reimbursements (proxy for clinical revenue). Sex differences in salary were estimated after adjusting for these factors. EXPOSURES Physician sex. Main Outcomes and Measures Annual salary. RESULTS Among 10 241 physicians, female physicians (n = 3549) had lower mean (SD) unadjusted salaries than male physicians ($206 641 [$88 238] vs $257 957 [$137 202]; absolute difference, $51 315 [95% CI, $46 330-$56 301]).

Sex differences in salary varied across specialties, institutions, and faculty ranks. For example, adjusted salaries of female full professors ($250 971 [95% CI, $242 307-$259 635]) were comparable to those of male associate professors ($247 212 [95% CI, $241 850-$252 575]). Among specialties, adjusted salaries were highest in orthopedic surgery ($358 093 [95% CI, $344 354-$371 831]), surgical subspecialties ($318 760 [95% CI, $311 030-$326 491]), and general surgery ($302 666 [95% CI, $294 060-$311 272]) and lowest in infectious disease, family medicine, and neurology (mean income, <$200 000). Years of experience, total publications, clinical trial participation, and Medicare payments were positively associated with salary.

Covariates assessed included race/ethnicity; years since first academic appointment; retention in academic career; academic rank; departmental affiliation; percent effort distribution across clinical, teaching, administrative, and research duties; marital and parental status; and any leave or part-time status in the years between surveys., RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, women earned a mean of $20,520 less than men (P = .03); women made 90 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. This difference was reduced to $16,982 (P = .04) after adjusting for covariates. The mean difference of $15,159 was no longer significant (P = .06) when adjusting covariates and for those who had ever taken a leave or worked part-time., CONCLUSIONS: The continued gender gap in compensation cannot be accounted for by metrics used to calculate salary.

Gender differences in salary of internal medicine residency directors: A national survey,Willett L.L.; ; Halvorsen A.J.; McDonald F.S.; Chaudhry S.I.; Arora V.M.,"Objectives Whether salary disparities exist between men and women in medical education leadership roles is not known. The study objective was to determine whether salary disparities exist between male and female Internal Medicine residency program directors, and if so, to identify factors associated with the disparities and explore historical trends. Methods The annual Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) survey in August 2012 included items to assess the salary and demographic characteristics of program directors, which were merged with publically available program data. To assess historical trends, we used similarly obtained survey data from 2008 to 2011. The study included program directors of 370 APDIM member programs, representing 95.6% of the 387 accredited Internal Medicine training programs in the United States and Puerto Rico. Of the 370 APDIM member programs, 241 (65.1%) completed the survey, of whom 169 (70.1%) were men and 72 (29.9%) were women. Program directors' total annual salary, measured in $25,000 increments, ranged from $75,000 or less to more than $400,000. Historical trends of mode salary by gender from 2008 to 2012 were assessed. Results The mode salary was $200,000 to 225,000 for men and $175,000 to $200,000 for women (P =.0005). After controlling for academic rank, career in general internal medicine, and program director age, the distribution of salary remained different by gender (P =.004). Historical trends show that the difference in mode salary has persisted since 2008. Conclusions Leaders in academic medical centers, residency and fellowship directors, and all faculty in medical education need to be aware that salary disparities cited decades ago persist in this sample of medical educators.

"A salary equity study: Differences by gender and race, department of medicine, University of Minnesota",Joseph A.; ; Miller W.; Menk J.; McMullan S.,"BACKGROUND: Salary inequities for female faculty have been documented in many academic disciplines. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The University of Minnesota Department of Medicine (DOM) conducted cross-sectional studies in 2011, 2012, and 2013 with the objective of examining gender equity issues related to salary (n=165, n=196, and n= 213 respectively). A pre-specified multivariable linear regression was used to adjust the salary comparison between men and women and Whites and non-Whites. The analysis included the following variables: gender, race, academic rank (and time in rank), leadership roles, degree(s), number of ABIM certifications, time from highest degree to current position, percent clinical effort, and subspecialty. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In 2011, 8 % of women were full Professors compared to 35 % of men. Leadership roles were held by 7 % of women compared to 19 % of men; similar differences in career characteristics were observed across all 3 years. The unadjusted mean salary for women was $69,717-$76,009 lower compared to men depending on the year. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 the adjusted mean comparisons for women vs. men were $-10,513, -$9,377, and -$16,132 respectively. For non-Whites vs. Whites the comparisons were -$9,018, -$741, and -$13,002. R-squared values for the models were between 0.757 and 0.767. As predicted, the model confirmed that the following were associated with increased salary: a PhD or Masters in addition to MD degree, number of ABIM certifications, rank, time variables, and holding a leadership position. For clinicians, procedural subspecialties (cardiology, gastroenterology, pulmonary, renal) conferred higher salaries than hematology-oncology-transplant, endocrinology, rheumatology, infectious disease, general internal medicine (in that order). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Gender differences persisted over the 3-year period despite preferential salary adjustments for women. Professional accomplishment characteristics do not fully explain faculty salary differences by gender and race. In response, the DOM has formed a Salary Equity Committee to systematically address these differences abiding by principles of transparency, simplicity, value of clinical, educational and research missions, validated benchmarks of productivity, equal access to leadership positions and supplemental income, and sustainability.

The results show that fields of study are an important source of gender wage disparities in both countries. In Germany, associations between characteristics of fields and wages do not seem to differ between the genders.

The impact of targeted fee increases on the pay disparity between female and male general surgeons in British Columbia.,Hwang H; Barton A; Jenkin D; Scott TM,"BACKGROUND: High-level payment data provided by Doctors of BC showed a 19.7% pay disparity in annual payments between female and male general surgeons in fiscal year 2019/20, and this was previously as high as 30% in 2012/13. This study aimed to examine the impact of targeted fee increases on pay disparity by sex over time. METHODS: The top 35 fees billed by female general surgeons, representing 76.3% of total payments, were retrospectively analyzed. The pay disparity by sex was calculated for each individual fee from 2000/01 to 2019/20. RESULTS: There were notable billing differences between female and male general surgeons. Female surgeons billed breast oncology procedures, malignancy consultations and visits, and peritoneal malignancy surgical procedures in greater proportions than did their male counterparts. Male surgeons billed hemorrhoid banding and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy in greater proportions than their female counterparts. With targeted fee increases, pay disparity by sex worsened for 17 of the top 35 fees but improved for the other 18 from 2010/11 to 2019/20, to varying degrees, resulting in an overall reduction in pay disparity by sex from 23% to 15%. If across-the-board fee increases had been implemented instead of targeted fee increases, the disparity in 2019/20 would have been 19% instead of 15%. CONCLUSION: Targeted fee increases reduced pay disparity between male and female general surgeons compared with theoretical across-the-board fee increases in British Columbia from 2010/11 to 2019/20, but not uniformly; some fee increases resulted in increased disparity.

To better characterize equity in the field of radiation oncology, we sought to describe the current academic radiation oncology workforce, including any contemporary differences in compensation and rank by gender and race/ethnicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) 2018 Financial Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with associate or full professor rank. Compensation was compared by gender and race/ethnicity overall and stratified by rank and was further analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Of the 858 academic radiation oncologists from 63 departments in the United States in the sample, 33.2% were female, 65.2% were White, 27.2% were Asian, and 7.6% were underrepresented in medicine (URiM). There were 44.0% assistant professors, 32.0% associate professors, and 22.8% full professors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for factors associated with associate or full professor rank did not reveal statistically significant associations between gender or race/ethnicity with academic rank (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.32; P = .48 for gender; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.5-1.30; P = .37 for Asian vs White; and OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.31-1.55; P = .37 for URiM vs White), but CIs were wide due to sample size, and point estimates were <1.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine if practicing Canadian radiologists' self-reported income is related to gender, controlling for demographic and work variables. Methods: English and French online surveys were distributed by email and social media to radiologists and trainees (May-July 2021). The association between Gender (controlling for Ethnicity variables, Region, having Children, Full-/Part-Time work, and Academic position) and Self-Reported Income was examined using chi-square tests. Pearson correlations examined relationships between opinion variables. Analyses were conducted using SPSS V28.0. A priori significance was P < .05. Study had ethics approval. Results: Four hundred and fifty-four practicing Canadian radiologists responded. Majority were women (51.2%, n = 227), a non-visible Minority (71.7%, n = 317), and from Western Provinces (67.8%, n = 308).

"Marriage, Children, and Sex-Based Differences in Physician Hours and Income.",Skinner L; Yates M; Auerbach DI; Buerhaus PI; Staiger DO,"IMPORTANCE: A better understanding of the association between family structure and sex gaps in physician earnings and hours worked over the life cycle is needed to advance policies addressing persistent sex disparities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in earnings and hours worked for male and female physicians at various ages and family status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study used data on physicians aged 25 to 64 years responding to the American Community Survey between 2005 and 2019. EXPOSURES: Earned income and work hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included annual earned income, usual hours worked per week, and earnings per hour worked. Gaps in earnings and hours by sex were calculated by family status and physician age and, in some analyses, adjusted for demographic characteristics and year of survey. Data analyses were conducted between 2019 and 2022. RESULTS: The sample included 95 435 physicians (35.8% female, 64.2% male, 19.8% Asian, 4.8% Black, 5.9% Hispanic, 67.3% White, and 2.2% other race or ethnicity) with a mean (SD) age of 44.4 (10.4) years. Relative to male physicians, female physicians were more likely to be single (18.8% vs 11.2%) and less likely to have children (53.3% vs 58.2%). Male-female earnings gaps grew with age and, when accumulated from age 25 to 64 years, were approximately $1.6 million for single physicians, $2.5 million for married physicians without children, and $3.1 million for physicians with children. Gaps in earnings per hour did not vary by family structure, with male physicians earning between 21.4% and 23.9% more per hour than female physicians. The male-female gap in hours worked was 0.6% for single physicians, 7.0% for married physicians without children, and 17.5% for physicians with children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of US physicians, marriage and children were associated with a greater earnings penalty for female physicians, primarily due to fewer hours worked relative to men.

The physician gender pay gap in Maryland: current state and future directions.,Zhou A; Leon C; O'Conor C; Johannesen C; Ranasinghe P,"BACKGROUND: Over the last few decades, more attention has been paid to the physician gender pay gap and more interventions have been attempted. This paper discusses the physician gender pay gap between 2017 and 2021 in Maryland.

Gender differences in income among psychiatrists in China: Findings from a national survey.,Han X; Shen L; Tong J; Jiang F; Liu H; Zhu J,"BACKGROUND: Gender income disparity in healthcare settings is a longstanding issue around the globe, but such evidence among Chinese psychiatrists is scarce. This study investigated whether gender income differences exist among physicians in China. METHODS: Data came from the 2019 national survey data of 4,520 psychiatrists in major public psychiatric hospitals across China. Self-reported monthly income after tax (in Chinese Yuan, CNY) by participants at all professional ranks was assessed. Average monthly income by gender was reported. Adjusted income differences between male and female psychiatrists were examined using multivariable regression models, adjusting with inverse probability of treatment weights and controlling for psychiatrist demographics (e.g., gender, professional rank, marital status, educational level, and work hours) and hospital fixed effects. RESULTS: The unadjusted mean difference in monthly income after tax by gender was 555 CNY (about $86; 95% CI, -825 to -284; mean [SD] for men: 8,652 [4,783] CNY and for women: 8,097 [4,350] CNY) in all psychiatrists. After regression adjustments, the income difference by gender among all psychiatrists reduced substantially and became insignificant. However, gender income difference was still observed among senior-level psychiatrists, where female psychiatrists earned 453 CNY (about $70; 95% CI, -810 to -95) significantly less than male psychiatrists.

Information and communications technology use to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence in low- and middle-income countries: An evidence and gap map.,Philbrick W; Milnor J; Deshmukh M; Mechael P,"BACKGROUND: The use of information and communications technologies (ICT) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) has increased significantly in the last several years, particularly in health, including related areas such as preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against women and children. While the evidence for ICT effectiveness has grown significantly in the past 5 years in other aspects of health, it has not for effectiveness of using ICT for the prevention and response to SGBV against women and children in LMIC. OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to establish a baseline for the state of the evidence connected with the use of ICT for preventing and responding to SGBV against women and children in LMIC. Objectives that contribute to the achievement of this goal are: (1)identifying evidence of effectiveness for the use of ICT targeting the prevention of, and response to, SGBV against women and children in LMIC;(2)identifying key gaps in the available ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response evidence;(3)identifying research methodology issues reflected in the current evidence;(4)identifying any clusters of evidence in one or more ICT interventions suitable for systematic review;(5)identifying enabling factors associated with effective interventions using ICT for the prevention of, and response to, SGBV against women and children in LMIC; and(6)providing a structured and accessible guide to stakeholders for future investment into interventions and research using ICT for SGBV prevention and response in LMIC. SEARCH METHODS: The date of the last search from which records were evaluated, and any studies identified were incorporated into the EGM was July 11, 2021. Twenty (20) databases were searched, and identified under ""Methods."" SELECTION CRITERIA: We conducted systematic searches of multiple academic databases using search terms and criteria related to the use of ICT for prevention and/or response to SGBV against women and children. Although excluded, we did consider studies conducted in higher-income countries (HIC) only to provide context and contrast for the EGM discussion of the eligible studies from LMIC. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The EGM search process included five phases: (1) initial search of academic databases conducted by two researchers simultaneously; (2) comparison of search results, and abstract screening by two researchers collaboratively; (3) second screening by reviewing full articles of the studies identified in the first screening by two reviewers independently; (4) comparison of results of second screening; resolution of discrepancies of screening results; and (5) data extraction and analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The EGM includes 10 studies published in English of which 4 were systematic, literature or scoping reviews directly addressing some aspect of the use of ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response in women and girls. The six individual studies were, or are being, conducted in LMIC (a condition for eligibility). No eligible studies addressed children as a target group, although a number of the ineligible studies reported on the use of ICT for intermediate outcomes connected with violence against children (e.g., digital parenting). Yet, such studies did not explicitly attach those intermediate outcomes to SGBV prevention or response outcomes. Countries represented among the eligible individual studies include Cambodia, Kenya, Nepal Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Lebanon. Of the 10 eligible studies (individual and reviews), most focused on intimate partner violence against women (IPV). Intervention areas among the eligible studies include safety planning using decision algorithms, educational and empowerment messaging regarding norms and attitudes towards gender-based violence (GBV), multi-media radio drama for social behavior change, the collection of survivor experience to inform SGBV/GBV services, and the collection of forensic evidence connected to the perpetration of SGBV. Thirty-one studies which otherwise would have been eligible for the evidence and gap map (EGM) were conducted in HIC (identified under ""Excluded Reviews""). None of the eligible studies reported results related to effectiveness of using ICT in a control setting, for the primary prevention of SGBV as an outcome, but rather reported on outcomes such as usability, secondary and tertiary prevention, feasibility, access to services and other outcomes primarily relating to the development of the interventions. Two studies identified IPV prevention as a measurable outcome within their protocols, but one of these had not yet formally published results regarding primary prevention as an outcome. The other study, while reporting on the protocol (and steps to adapt the ICT application, previously reported as effective in HIC contexts to a specific LMIC context), has not yet as of the date of writing this EGM, published outcome results related to the reduction of IPV. Of the four reviews identified as eligible, two are better characterized as either a literature review or case study rather than as traditional systematic reviews reporting on impact outcomes with methodologically rigorous protocols. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence baseline for using ICT to prevent and/or respond to SGBV against women and children in LMIC is nascent. Promising areas for future study include: (1) how ICT can contribute changing gender and social norms related to SGBV and primary prevention; (2) mobile phone applications that promote safety and security; (3) mobile technology for the collection and analysis of survivors' experience with SGBV response services; and (4) digital tools that support the collection of forensic evidence for SGBV response and secondary prevention. Most striking is the paucity of eligible studies examining the use of ICT in connection with preventing or responding to SGBV against children. In light of the exponential increase in the use of ICT by children and adolescents, even in LMIC, greater attention should be given to examining how ICT can be used during adolescence to address gender norms that lead to SGBV. While there appears to be interest in using ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response in LMIC, other than several ad hoc studies, there is little evidence of if, and how effective these interventions are. Further inquiry should be made regarding if and how interventions proven effective in HIC can be adapted to LMIC contexts.",2022,Dec,Campbell Syst Rev,18,4,e1277,,10.1002/cl2.1277,36908839,#80,Philbrick 2022,"",""
How the Gender Wage Gap for Primary Care Physicians Differs by Compensation Approach : A Microsimulation Study.,Ganguli I; Mulligan KL; Phillips RL; Basu S,"BACKGROUND: The physician gender wage gap may be due, in part, to productivity-based compensation models that undervalue female practice patterns. OBJECTIVE: To determine how primary care physician (PCP) compensation by gender differs when applying existing productivity-based and alternative compensation models. DESIGN: Microsimulation. SETTING: 2016 to 2019 national clinical registry of 1222 primary care practices. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female PCPs matched on specialty, years since medical school graduation, practice site, and sessions worked. MEASUREMENTS: Net annual, full-time-equivalent compensation for male versus female PCPs, under productivity-based fee-for-service, panel size-based capitation without or with risk adjustment, and hybrid payment models. Microsimulation inputs included patient and visit characteristics and overhead expenses. RESULTS: Among 1435 matched male (n = 881) and female (n = 554) PCPs, female PCP panels included patients who were, on average, younger, had lower diagnosis-based risk scores, were more often female, and were more often uninsured or insured by Medicaid rather than by Medicare. Under productivity-based payment, female PCPs earned a median of $58 829 (interquartile range [IQR], $39 553 to $120 353; 21%) less than male PCPs. This gap was similar under capitation ($58 723 [IQR, $42 141 to $140 192]). It was larger under capitation risk-adjusted for age alone ($74 695 [IQR, $42 884 to $152 423]), for diagnosis-based scores alone ($114 792 [IQR, $49 080 to $215 326] and $89 974 [IQR, $26 175 to $173 760]), and for age-, sex-, and diagnosis-based scores ($83 438 [IQR, $28 927 to $129 414] and $66 195 [IQR, $11 899 to $96 566]). The gap was smaller and nonsignificant under capitation risk-adjusted for age and sex ($36 631 [IQR, $12 743 to $73 898]). LIMITATION: Panel attribution based on office visits. CONCLUSION: The gender wage gap varied by compensation model, with capitation risk-adjusted for patient age and sex resulting in a smaller gap.

Gender Differences in Compensation in Anesthesiology in the United States: Results of a National Survey of Anesthesiologists.,Hertzberg LB; Miller TR; Byerly S; Rebello E; Flood P; Malinzak EB; Doyle CA; Pease S; Rock-Klotz JA; Kraus MB; Pai SL,"BACKGROUND: A gender-based compensation gap among physicians is well documented. Even after adjusting for age, experience, work hours, productivity, and academic rank, the gender gap remained and widened over the course of a physician's career. This study aimed to examine if a significant gender pay gap still existed for anesthesiologists in the United States. METHODS: In 2018, we surveyed 28,812 physician members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists to assess the association of compensation with gender and to identify possible causes of wage disparities. Gender was the primary variable examined in the model, and compensation by gender was the primary outcome. Compensation was defined as the amount reported as direct compensation on a W-2, 1099, or K-1, plus all voluntary salary reductions (eg, 401[k], health insurance). The survey directed respondents to include salary, bonuses, incentive payments, research stipends, honoraria, and distribution of profits to employees. Respondents had the option of providing a point estimate of their compensation or selecting a range in $50,000 increments. Potential confounding variables that could affect compensation were identified based on a scoping literature review and the consensus expertise of the authors. We fitted a generalized ordinal logistic regression with 7 ranges of compensation. For the sensitivity analyses, we used linear regressions of log-transformed compensation based on respondent point estimates and imputed values. RESULTS: The final analytic sample consisted of 2081 observations (response rate, 7.2%). This sample represented a higher percentage of women and younger physicians compared to the demographic makeup of anesthesiologists in the United States. The adjusted odds ratio associated with gender equal to woman was an estimated 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.53), indicating that for a given compensation range, women had a 56% lower odds than men of being in a higher compensation range. Sensitivity analyses found the relative percentage difference in compensation for women compared to men ranged from -8.3 to -8.9. In the sensitivity analysis based on the subset of respondents (n = 1036) who provided a point estimate of compensation, the relative percentage difference (-8.3%; 95% confidence interval, -4.7 to -11.7) reflected a $32,617 lower compensation for women than men, holding other covariates at their means.

When Physicians Marry Physicians: Gender Inequities in Work Hours and Income.,Hu X; Dill M,"Background: Physicians marry other physicians at a high rate, and theories suggest being married to a physician (MTP) may impact a physician's productivity in different ways. This impact may differ by gender and rurality of work location. This study empirically examines MTP's effects by gender and rurality of physicians' work location. Data and Method: This study uses both the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2019 National Sample Survey of Physicians (n = 6,000) and the American Community Survey data 2006-2017 (n = 72,900). We conducted cross-sectional, multivariate analysis with interaction terms between MTP, gender, and rurality, controlling for various work and personal characteristics. Results: A female MTP physician works 2.9 fewer hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.3 to -1.4, p = 0.000) per week than a female non-MTP physician, while a male MTP physician's weekly work hours are not significantly different from a male non-MTP physician's. Compared to non-MTP counterparts, male MTP physicians are more likely to have on-call work, and female MTP physicians are much less likely to have on-call work; male MTP physicians earn $6,635 more (95% CIs: $1,613-$11,657, p = 0.010) per year, while female MTP female physicians earn $5,018 less (95% CIs: -$10,684 to $648, p = 0.083). Furthermore, the MTP-associated gender differential effects are more prominent for physicians in rural areas than in urban areas. Results from both datasets are highly comparable. Conclusions: MTP's effects widen the gender gap in physicians' work hours, on-call probability, and earnings. Understanding and examining the mechanisms for these gender differential effects are essential to promote equity in the physician workforce.",2021,,Womens Health Rep (New Rochelle),2,1,422-429,,10.1089/whr.2021.0048,34671763,#96,Hu 2021,"",""
Real wage growth in the U.S. health workforce and the narrowing of the gender pay gap.,Barry J,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare has been identified as a job engine during recent recessions in the U.S. Whether the healthcare sector provides better than average pay remains a question. This study investigates if wages grew with the expanding demand for healthcare workers between 2001 and 2017. Wage growth in the (1) physicians and surgeons, (2) nurse, (3) healthcare practitioner and technical, (4) healthcare support, and (5) direct patient care jobs are examined. The gender pay gap in each occupation is investigated. METHODS: The American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata sample (PUMS) for 2001, 2004, 2008, 2013, and 2017 were used to derive hourly wages for full-time, full-year workers aged 18-75. The cumulative percent change in unadjusted, median hourly wages between 2001 and 2017 was calculated for each occupation. Quantile regression estimates predicted a median hourly wage for men and women by year and job after adjusting for differences in demographics, industry, and hours worked. RESULTS: Unadjusted median wage growth was 9.92% for nurses, 5.68% for healthcare practitioners, and 37.6% for physicians between 2001 and 2017. These rates are roughly above the estimated national rate of wage growth at the 50th wage percentile. In healthcare support and direct patient care occupations, workers experienced either stagnant or negative wage growth. Women had lower occupational wages than men. CONCLUSION: The slow or negative median wage growth in all but the physician occupation between 2004-2008 and 2008-2013 confirms that healthcare wages in the U.S. are not recession-proof, unlike healthcare employment. Generally, women's earnings grew at rates that were higher or less negative than rates for men. This trend contributed to narrowing the gender pay gap in every occupation except for nurse.",2021,Aug,Hum Resour Health,19,1,105,,10.1186/s12960-021-00647-3,34454538,#99,Barry 2021,"",""
The gender wage gap among medical specialists: a quantitative analysis of the hourly pay of publicly employed senior doctors in New Zealand.,Sin I; Bruce-Brand B; Chambers CNL,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the gender gap in hourly wages earned by medical specialists in their main jobs after controlling for age, number of hours worked and medical specialty. DESIGN: Observational using governmental administrative and survey data. SETTING: New Zealand public employed medical workforce. PARTICIPANTS: 3510 medical specialists who were employed for wages or a salary in a medical capacity by a New Zealand district health board (DHB) at the time of the March 2013 census, whose census responses on hours worked were complete and can be matched to tax records of earnings to construct hourly earnings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hourly earnings in the DHB job calculated from usual weekly hours worked reported in the census and wage or salary earnings paid in the month recorded in administrative tax data. RESULTS: In their DHB employment, female specialists earned on average 12.5% lower hourly wages than their male counterparts of the same age, in the same specialty, who work the same number of hours (95% CI 9.9% to 15.1%). Adding controls for a wide range of personal and work characteristics decreased the estimated gap only slightly to 11.2% (95% CI 8.6% to 13.8%). At most, 4.5 percentage points can be explained by gender differences in experience at the same age. CONCLUSIONS: Male specialists earn a large and statistically significant premium over their female colleagues. Age, specialty and hours of work do not appear to drive these wage gaps. These findings suggest that employment agreements that specify minimum wages for each level of experience, and progression through these levels, are insufficient to eliminate gender wage gaps between similar men and women with the same experience.",2021,Apr,BMJ Open,11,4,e045214,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045214,33906840,#101,Sin 2021,"",""
The Gender Pay Gap in Urology.,North AC; Fang R; Anger J; Breyer BN; Meeks W; Goldman HB; Cooperberg MR; Makarov DV,"INTRODUCTION: Female physicians earn less than males in every medical specialty. We sought to determine whether a pay gap existed in urology and explore potential associated factors. METHODS: We used 2,323 responses to the 2017 American Urological Association census to represent all 12,517 U.S. urologists. We limited analysis to ages 34 to 65 and matched on years in practice. We explored the association between self-reported salary (more than $350,000 vs less than $350,000) and gender using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and practice. RESULTS: On bivariate analysis males were more likely to make more than $350,000 (56.9% vs 39.7%, p=0.01). There were no gender differences in weekly clinical (43.1 female vs 46.9 male, p=0.13) or nonclinical hours (7.9 female vs 9.1 male, p=0.23). Men do more inpatient procedures per month (7.8 vs 5.6, p=0.02) and more patient visits per week (78.4 vs. 68.4, p=0.04). Women spent more time with each patient (17.6 vs 14.9 minutes, p <0.01). On unadjusted logistic regression men were more likely to earn more than $350,000 (OR 2.01, p=0.02). On multivariable regression, gender was no longer significant (OR 1.59, p=0.11). Factors associated with earning more than $350,000 include more clinical/fewer nonclinical hours, shorter/more office visits, more inpatient surgeries, private practice, subspecialty training, Northeast location and nonWhite race. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests a gender pay gap. While men and women work equal hours, women urologists are more likely to work in less profitable settings, perform fewer inpatient procedures and see fewer patients. Future research needs to understand whether women choose these practices or whether external factors compel them to do so.",2021,Jan,Urol Pract,8,1,149-154,,10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000169,37145431,#103,North 2021,"",""
"Online biology degree program broadens access for women, first-generation to college, and low-income students, but grade disparities remain.",Mead C; Supriya K; Zheng Y; Anbar AD; Collins JP; LePore P; Brownell SE,"Online education has grown rapidly in recent years with many universities now offering fully online degree programs even in STEM disciplines. These programs have the potential to broaden access to STEM degrees for people with social identities currently underrepresented in STEM. Here, we ask to what extent is that potential realized in terms of student enrollment and grades for a fully online degree program. Our analysis of data from more than 10,000 course-enrollments compares student demographics and course grades in a fully online biology degree program to demographics and grades in an equivalent in-person biology degree program at the same university. We find that women, first-generation to college students and students eligible for federal Pell grants constitute a larger proportion of students in the online program compared to the in-person mode. However, the online mode of instruction is associated with lower course grades relative to the in-person mode. Moreover, African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, and Pacific Islander students as well as federal Pell grant eligible students earned lower grades than white students and non-Pell grant eligible students, respectively, but the grade disparities were similar among both in-person and online student groups. Finally, we find that grade disparities between men and women are larger online compared to in-person, but that for first-generation to college women, the online mode of instruction is associated with little to no grade gap compared to continuing generation women. Our findings indicate that although this online degree program broadens access for some student populations, inequities in the experience remain and need to be addressed in order for online education to achieve its inclusive mission.",2020,,PLoS One,15,12,e0243916,,10.1371/journal.pone.0243916,33306720,#104,Mead 2020,"",""
Physician Work Hours and the Gender Pay Gap - Evidence from Primary Care.,Ganguli I; Sheridan B; Gray J; Chernew M; Rosenthal MB; Neprash H,"BACKGROUND: The gender gap in physician pay is often attributed in part to women working fewer hours than men, but evidence to date is limited by self-report and a lack of detail regarding clinical revenue and gender differences in practice style. METHODS: Using national all-payer claims and data from electronic health records, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 24.4 million primary care office visits in 2017 and performed comparisons between female and male physicians in the same practices. Our primary independent variable was physician gender; outcomes included visit revenue, visit counts, days worked, and observed visit time (interval between the initiation and the termination of a visit). We created multivariable regression models at the year, day, and visit level after adjustment for characteristics of the primary care physicians (PCPs), patients, and types of visit and for practice fixed effects. RESULTS: In 2017, female PCPs generated 10.9% less revenue from office visits than their male counterparts (-$39,143.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], -53,523.0 to -24,763.4) and conducted 10.8% fewer visits (-330.5 visits; 95% CI, -406.6 to -254.3) over 2.6% fewer clinical days (-5.3 days; 95% CI, -7.7 to -3.0), after adjustment for age, academic degree, specialty, and number of sessions worked per week, yet spent 2.6% more observed time in visits that year than their male counterparts (1201.3 minutes; 95% CI, 184.7 to 2218.0). Per visit, after adjustment for PCP, patient, and visit characteristics, female PCPs generated equal revenue but spent 15.7% more time with a patient (2.4 minutes; 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.6). These results were consistent in subgroup analyses according to the gender and health status of the patients and the type and complexity of the visits. CONCLUSIONS: Female PCPs generated less visit revenue than male colleagues in the same practices owing to a lower volume of visits, yet spent more time in direct patient care per visit, per day, and per year.

Gender Differences in Earnings of Early- and Midcareer Pediatricians.,Frintner MP; Sisk B; Byrne BJ; Freed GL; Starmer AJ; Olson LM,"BACKGROUND: The US physician workforce includes an increasing number of women, with pediatrics having the highest percentage. In recent research on physicians, it is indicated that men earn more than women. It is unclear how this finding extends to pediatricians. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional 2016 data on earnings from the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study, a longitudinal study of early- and midcareer pediatricians. To estimate adjusted differences in pediatrician earnings between men and women, we conducted 4 ordinary least squares regression models. Model 1 examined gender, unadjusted; model 2 controlled for labor force characteristics; model 3 controlled for both labor force and physician-specific job characteristics; and model 4 controlled for labor force, physician-specific job, and work-family characteristics. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study participants completed the 2016 surveys (1213 out of 1801). The analytic sample was restricted to participants who completed training and worked in general pediatrics, hospitalist care, or subspecialty care (n = 998). Overall pediatrician-reported mean annual income was $189 804. Before any adjustment, women earned ∼76% of what men earned, or ∼$51 000 less. Adjusting for common labor force characteristics such as demographics, work hours, and specialty, women earned ∼87% of what men earned, or ∼$26 000 less. Adjusting for a comprehensive set of labor force, physician-specific job, and work-family characteristics, women earned ∼94% of what men earned, or ∼$8000 less.

Gender differences in the incomes of self-employed French physicians: The role of family structure.,Mikol F; Franc C,"In most developed countries, the average income of female physicians remains much lower than that of their male counterparts. This paper analyses how much of the gender earnings gap among French self-employed physicians can be attributed to women's family responsibilities, choice of medical specialty, and opportunity to charge extra billings. The question is of growing concern for regulators because it may influence patients' future access to care. We used an exhaustive administrative database that merges information on the medical activity, earnings, and family structure of self-employed doctors in 2005, 2008, and 2011. Using the 2011 database, results suggest that when demographic and professional characteristics are controlled, female physicians still exhibit an annual earnings gap that varies according to family structure: having young children worsens the situation of female physicians, particularly GPs. Using our panel datasets from 2005, we show that there is a 'carer effect' of having children for female doctors that exacerbates the gender income gap, particularly for GPs. We do not highlight any real strategic behaviour of female specialists authorised to charge extra fees to increase their extra billings after a birth to maintain their previous income.",2019,Jul,Health Policy,123,7,666-674,,10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.05.002,31151826,#115,Mikol 2019,"",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiation oncology physician faculty at US public academic medical schools were identified in states that report public university radiation oncology faculty salary. Information pertaining to sex, academic rank, experience, clinical volume, and academic productivity were collected. Simple (1 predictor) and multiple (more than 1 predictor) generalized linear mixed-effect models for compensation were used to simultaneously assess the impact of physician-level and institutional-level variables, while accounting for potential correlations within institutions. To minimize the impact of faculty members working less than a full-time equivalent, a Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity analysis was conducted, and faculty with reported salaries under $175,000 were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 247 eligible faculty (81 women, 166 men) with public salary data were identified at 22 US public academic radiation oncology departments in 14 states. Unadjusted mean salary was 12.6% ($48,974) lower for women ($341,173; 95% confidence interval [CI], $304,581-$382,162) than it was for men ($390,147; 95% CI, $353,693-$430,358; P < .01). A $26,458 gap (6.4%) in mean salary between men ($411,829; 95% CI, $367,282-$461,780) and women ($385,371; 95% CI, $342,388-$433,749) persisted on multivariable analysis after accounting for other factors (P < .01). The salary gap remained statistically significant on sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Mean salary for women at US public academic radiation oncology departments was lower than mean salary for men, after adjusting for confounders. Our analysis was limited to public data and could not account for relevant private personal choices and departmental factors. The salary gap may differ in other practice environments.

The gender differences in highly paid wage: a case study of Peruvian physicians.,Amaya E; Mougenot B,"In recent decades, the number of women pursuing careers in health has significantly increased. However, the physician labor market is still characterized by gender differences regarding payment. Using a nationally representative Peruvian sample of health providers (3,219 male and 1,063 female physicians), we estimated the gender gap in the likelihood of earning high wages for physicians and decomposed this gap in a proportion related to differences in individual characteristics (e.g. specialty, labor experience), and a residual proportion related to differences in returns to these characteristics. Our main results reveal that male physicians have on average an 81% higher likelihood of earning high salaries (monthly earning level > 5,000 PEN) relative to their female counterparts. Further, the main proportion of this gap is associated to the unexplained component (among 57% and 77%, according to the model specification), which may be associated to unobservable characteristics and discrimination in the Peruvian labor market.",2019,,Cad Saude Publica,35,5,e00043018,,10.1590/0102-311x00043018,31166416,#124,Amaya 2019,"",""
A Structured Compensation Plan Improves But Does Not Erase the Sex Pay Gap in Surgery.,Morris M; Chen H; Heslin MJ; Krontiras H,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the sex pay gap in a large academic department of surgery and a recently instituted structured compensation plan. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A recent large study found that after controlling for measures of academic and clinical productivity, male physicians earned nearly $20,000 more annually than female physicians. Increased salary transparency has been proposed as a method to reduce this disparity. METHODS: A new structured compensation plan was developed to improve transparency of compensation and financial viability of each division. The total compensations of each faculty member before and after the new compensation plan were calculated. Salaries were compared with the Association of Academic Medical Colleges (AAMC) median value based on specialty, region, academic rank, stratified by sex and compared. Work relative value units (wRVUs) were calculated for each faculty member during the entire study period, stratified by sex and compared. RESULTS: Among 44 eligible surgeons (33 men and 11 women), a sex pay gap existed with male surgeon salaries significantly higher than female surgeon salaries [56% (8 to 213) vs 26% (1 to 64); P < 0.00001] despite similar RVU production (men 8725 ± 831 vs women 7818 ± 911, P = 0.454). The new compensation plan did not significantly change male surgeon salaries [56% (8 to 213) vs 58% (26 to 159); P = 0.552] but did significantly increase the salaries of female surgeons [26% (1 to 64) vs 42% (10 to 80); P = 0.026]. CONCLUSION: A structured compensation plan can improve the sex pay gap in a short period of time. More transparency in surgical compensation plans is essential to understand the most equitable way to compensate all surgeons.",2018,Sep,Ann Surg,268,3,442-448,,10.1097/SLA.0000000000002928,29979249,#127,Morris 2018,"",""
Differences in Physician Income by Gender in a Multiregion Survey.,Apaydin EA; Chen PGC; Friedberg MW,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented income differences between male and female physicians. However, the implications of these differences are unclear, since previous studies have lacked detailed data on the quantity and composition of work hours. We sought to identify the sources of these income differences using data from a novel survey of physician work and income. OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in income between male and female physicians. DESIGN: We estimated unadjusted income differences between male and female physicians. We then adjusted these differences for total hours worked, composition of work hours, percent of patient care time spent providing procedures, specialty, compensation type, age, years in practice, race, ethnicity, and state and practice random effects. PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed 656 physicians in 30 practices in six states and received 439 responses (67% response rate): 263 from males and 176 from females. MAIN MEASURE: Self-reported annual income. KEY RESULTS: Male physicians had significantly higher annual incomes than female physicians (mean $297,641 vs. $206,751; difference $90,890, 95% CI $27,769 to $154,011) and worked significantly more total hours (mean 2470 vs. 2074; difference 396, 95% CI 250 to 542) and more patient care hours (mean 2203 vs. 1845; difference 358, 95% CI 212 to 505) per year. Male physicians were less likely than female physicians to specialize in primary care (49.1 vs. 70.5%), but more likely to perform procedures with (33.1 vs. 15.5%) or without general anesthesia (84.3 vs. 73.1%). After adjustment, male physicians' incomes were $27,404 (95% CI $3120 to $51,688) greater than female physicians' incomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment for multiple possible confounders, including the number and composition of work hours, can explain approximately 70% of unadjusted income differences between male and female physicians; 30% remains unexplained.

Sex Differences in Radiologist Salary in U.S. Public Medical Schools.,Kapoor N; Blumenthal DM; Smith SE; Ip IK; Khorasani R,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate salary differences between male and female academic radiologists at U.S. medical schools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laws in several U.S. states mandate public release of government records, including salary information of state employees. From online salary data published by 12 states, we extracted the salaries of all academic radiologists at 24 public medical schools during 2011-2013 (n = 573 radiologists). In this institutional review board-approved cross-sectional study, we linked these data to a physician database with information on physician sex, age, faculty rank, years since residency, clinical trial involvement, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, scientific publications, and clinical volume measured by 2013 Medicare payments. Sex difference in salary, the primary outcome, was estimated using a multilevel logistic regression adjusting for these factors. RESULTS: Among 573 academic radiologists, 171 (29.8%) were women. Female radiologists were younger (48.5 vs 51.6 years, p = 0.001) and more likely to be assistant professors (50.9% [87/171] vs 40.8% [164/402], p = 0.026). Salaries between men and women were similar in unadjusted analyses ($290,660 vs $289,797; absolute difference, $863; 95% CI, -$18,363 to $20,090), and remained so after adjusting for age, faculty rank, years since residency, clinical trial involvement, publications, total Medicare payments, NIH funding, and graduation from a highly ranked medical school.

"Trends in the earnings gender gap among dentists, physicians, and lawyers.",Nguyen Le TA; Lo Sasso AT; Vujicic M,"BACKGROUND: The authors examined the factors associated with sex differences in earnings for 3 professional occupations. METHODS: The authors used a multivariate Blinder-Oaxaca method to decompose the differences in mean earnings across sex. RESULTS: Although mean differences in earnings between men and women narrowed over time, there remained large, unaccountable earnings differences between men and women among all professions after multivariate adjustments. For dentists, the unexplained difference in earnings for women was approximately constant at 62% to 66%. For physicians, the unexplained difference in earnings for women ranged from 52% to 57%. For lawyers, the unexplained difference in earnings for women was the smallest of the 3 professions but also exhibited the most growth, increasing from 34% in 1990 to 45% in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the earnings gap is driven largely by a general convergence between men and women in some, but not all, observable characteristics over time. Nevertheless, large unexplained gender gaps in earnings remain for all 3 professions.

Differences in incomes of physicians in the United States by race and sex: observational study.,Ly DP; Seabury SA; Jena AB,"OBJECTIVES:  To estimate differences in annual income of physicians in the United States by race and sex adjusted for characteristics of physicians and practices. DESIGN:  Cross sectional survey study. SETTING:  Nationally representative samples of US physicians. PARTICIPANTS:  The 2000-13 American Community Survey (ACS) included 43 213 white male, 1698 black male, 15 164 white female, and 1252 black female physicians. The 2000-08 Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) physician surveys included 12 843 white male, 518 black male, 3880 white female, and 342 black female physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Annual income adjusted for age, hours worked, time period, and state of residence (from ACS data). Income was adjusted for age, specialty, hours worked, time period, years in practice, practice type, and percentage of revenue from Medicare/Medicaid (from HSC physician surveys). RESULTS:  White male physicians had a higher median annual income than black male physicians, whereas race was not consistently associated with median income among female physicians. For example, in 2010-13 in the ACS, white male physicians had an adjusted median annual income of $253 042 (95% confidence interval $248 670 to $257 413) compared with $188 230 ($170 844 to $205 616) for black male physicians (difference $64 812; P<0.001). White female physicians had an adjusted median annual income of $163 234 ($159 912 to 166 557) compared with $152 784 ($137 927 to $167 641) for black female physicians (difference $10 450; P=0.17). $100 000 is currently equivalent to about £69 000 (€89 000). Patterns were unaffected by adjustment for specialty and characteristics of practice in the HSC physician surveys. CONCLUSIONS:  White male physicians earn substantially more than black male physicians, after adjustment for characteristics of physicians and practices, while white and black female physicians earn similar incomes to each other, but significantly less than their male counterparts.

"Racial and ethnic differences in HPV knowledge, attitudes, and vaccination rates among low-income African-American, Haitian, Latina, and Caucasian young adult women.",Pierre Joseph N; Clark JA; Mercilus G; Wilbur M; Figaro J; Perkins R,"OBJECTIVE: To examine facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccine uptake in African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women aged 18-22 and to determine vaccination completion rates among participants over 5 years. DESIGN: Using semi-structured interviews and medical record review, we assessed HPV knowledge and attitudes towards HPV vaccination among young women. We then determined their subsequent HPV vaccination initiation and completion rates. We used constructs from the Health Belief Model and methods based in grounded theory and content analysis to identify attitudes towards HPV vaccination cues to initiate vaccination, perception of HPV, and how communication about issues of sexuality may impact vaccine uptake. PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled 132 African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women aged 18-22 years who visited an urban academic medical center and 2 affiliated community health centers between the years 2007 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intent to vaccinate and actual vaccination rates. RESULTS: Of 132 participants, 116 (90%) stated that they were somewhat or very likely to accept HPV vaccination if offered by their physician, but only 51% initiated the vaccination over the next 5 years. Seventy-eight percent of those who initiated vaccination completed the 3 doses of the HPV vaccine series. Forty-five percent (45%, n = 50) of the adolescents who started the series completed 3 doses over a 5-year period: 42% of African-American (n = 16), 33% of Haitian (n = 13), 63% of Latina (n = 10), and 65% of White young women (n = 11) completed the 3-dose series. Despite low knowledge, they reported high levels of trust in physicians and were willing to vaccinate if recommended by their physicians.

Investigation of Smartphone Addiction of Middle School and High School Students,"Erkol, Servet; Mentese, Sabit; Gökalp, Murat","Addiction is the state of being addicted to any activity, substance, object or behavior in a way that excludes other activities of one's life or causes physical, mental or social harm to oneself and others. In addition to many and various types of addiction, it seems that an important type of addiction is technology addiction. Today, the dizzying development of technological developments and their inclusion in every aspect of our lives has made it necessary for us to rethink the concepts of far and near. With the rapid development in mobile phone technology, the standard mobile phones used in the past to call someone or send a message to someone have been replaced by state-of-the-art smartphones that make our daily lives much easier. However, on the other hand, it is seen that addiction to smartphones, which have become an integral part of life, is on the rise, and this goes back to pre-school periods. In this context, the aim of the research was determined to examine whether the smartphone usage level of students studying in secondary and high schools affiliated to the National Education Directorate of Tunceli province Hozat district in the 2022-2023 academic year varies significantly according to some demographic characteristics of the students. Within the scope of quantitative research, the data of the research designed in the general survey model were collected by applying the ""Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (ATBÖ-SF)"", developed by Kwon et al. and adapted to Turkish by Noyan et al., face to face between May and June 2023. The scale, for which validity and reliability studies were conducted, was found to be suitable for the use of parametric tests, and in addition to test analyzes such as frequency, percentage, arithmetic mean, T Test and One-Way Variance Analysis were used to determine the significance of the difference using statistical data analysis techniques. As a result of the analysis, the average smartphone addiction level being below 3 was interpreted as the students not having smartphone addiction, but the measurements being just below the average indicating a risk factor, while the difference between the dependent and independent variables was not significant (p<0.005). According to the research findings, the smartphone addiction level of students at the lower limit of addiction carries a risk factor, in this respect the findings are warning, and it is recommended that parents, society, and especially schools and relevant institutions and organizations take precautions against the apparent danger.",2024,,Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET,23,4,130-144,3123161979; EJ1444578,,,#138,Erkol 2024,"",""

Wage Disparities in Academia for Engineering Women of Color and the Limitations of Advocacy and Agency,"McGee, Ebony; Cox, Monica F; Main, Joyce B; Miles, Monica L; Hailu, Meseret F","The devaluation of women of Color (WoC) by way of gender discrimination and systemic racism is well documented. For WoC in engineering a chief cause is the observable wage gap. Women who identify as Asian, Black/African American, Latina/Chicana, Indigenous/Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Native Alaskan, and/or multiracial have reported stark wage disparities. In this paper, we offer a phenomenological study of how WoC engineering faculty across U.S. academic institutions describe the challenges and practices associated with wage disparities and how they navigate these disparities. This study, which is based on participant interviews, is guided by three research questions: (1) What do WoC engineering tenure-track faculty perceive about wage disparities based on their race and gender? (2) How do WoC faculty understand the institutional practices that contribute to wage disparities? and (3) How do WoC engineering faculty respond to and address wage disparities? Using structural racism and intersectionality as our guiding conceptual framework, we interviewed 32 self-identified WoC who identified structures and systems of institutional racism related to the maintenance of wage disparities. In terms of findings, we note that WoC have two primary strategies to respond to wage disparity: advocacy and agency. The experiences of WoC engineering faculty in our study highlight unsatisfying institutional responses, and thus WoC often rely on their own agency to advocate for themselves and to advocate for and mentor other WoC faculty. We found a few notable cases where men advocated for women to help close the wage gap. Our work reveals that pay inequity for WoC is often coupled with other forms of exclusion and marginalization. Reducing wage disparities in academia is critical to advancing diversity efforts and ensuring equitable support for WoC faculty. Our findings suggest that institutions can work diligently to rectify wage inequality, including making sustainable structural and salary modifications and sharing the burden of combatting wage inequities.

Six third-order constructs were identified and integrated into a synthesized line-of-argument illustrating menstrual injustice at school. To ensure menstruating students do not face academic disadvantage because of schools' failure to accommodate menstrual needs, schools should challenge stigma, provide facilities to improve students' capability and confidence to manage menstruation, and provide academic support to menstruating students who miss classes.

Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Anxiety and Depression in College Students: Evidence from a Mexican University,"García-Andrés, Adelaido; Ramos-Tovar, María Elena; Aguayo-Téllez, Ernesto","This study examines the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms among college students, paying special attention to gender-related differences. To do that, we use data from a special survey applied to all students from one of Mexico's largest universities six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was applied online through the university's IT platform, obtaining a response rate of 48.2% and a final sample of 66,067 students. We follow an empirical strategy commonly found in the literature that involves the use of a Negative Binomial Regression Model on two mental health scales: the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Zung Depression Scale. The loss of household income and the resulting necessity to participate in the labor market, as well as the lack of sufficient infrastructure to face confinement and online study, were identified as the two main pathways via which the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the mental health of college students. Although female students presented higher rates of anxiety and depression and were more affected by the vulnerable economic and labor conditions of their families, male students were more affected by the lack of availability of space and equipment to attend online classes at home. Since the most economically disadvantaged students experience higher rates of anxiety and depression, particularly among women, this could have medium and long-term effects in terms of economic and gender inequality. These findings highlight the need for specific prevention and intervention initiatives to alleviate anxiety and depression.",2024,,Educational Research for Policy and Practice,23,1,157-174,3040237028; EJ1409951,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10671-023-09364-1,,#147,García-Andrés 2024,"",""
From Diversity to Inclusion: Centring the Voices of Undergraduate Engineering Students,"Hanson, Cori","Some Canadian undergraduate engineering programs report 30-40% of enrolled students are women. Kanter's tipping point theory argues that women become less tokenized when they make up 30% of a group's population. Other scholars have found that in comparable situations, women continued to experience discrimination, hostility, and competition. This critical study provides further evidence against a tipping point for equity by centring the experiences of traditionally underrepresented undergraduate students studying at a faculty of engineering with 35% women undergraduates enrolled. Reflective thematic analysis of experiences shared by women, racialized students, 2SLGBTQ+ students, and students from lower socio-economic statuses found instances of discrimination, varying perceptions of capabilities, and inequitable access to support, community, and on-campus leadership roles. Therefore, institutions need to acknowledge the intersectional experiences of students and work toward changing campus culture in addition to diversity efforts.",2023,,Canadian Journal of Higher Education,52,4,15-26,2901458030; EJ1399884,,,#148,Hanson 2023,"",""
Assessment of Demographic Biases Associated with the Ground Rules System in a Large Undergraduate Engineering Course,"King, Christine; Denaro, Kameryn; Sato, Brian","Despite more women and underrepresented students entering engineering, there are still gaps in achievement. A potential remedy is to establish equitable team dynamics during groupwork. Groupware systems have been implemented in the workforce and, recently, piloted in undergraduate lowerdivision education to establish team norms. Our prior work found that there was a significant association between gender and the utility of rules systems to establish team norms. To assess biases regarding gender and minority groups in the rules system, we examined the differences between rules chosen by individuals and teams based on demographic characteristics in a large engineering course. Students individually identified which rules were most important when working in a team, then formed teams and performed a ""negotiation"" to choose which rules the team would follow. We used statistical analyses to determine whether certain demographic factors predicted how influential an individual was during the selection process. We found that demographic and educational characteristics did not have a significant influence on decision-making for team rules. Furthermore, we found that female and first-generation students were more likely to select the rule ""Play an active part in the team"" than their male or continuing-generation peers.",2023,,Journal of College Science Teaching,52,3,46-54,2890039788; EJ1383600,,,#149,King 2023,"",""
"Informal Science Learning Experiences for Gender Equity, Inclusion and Belonging in STEM through a Feminist Intersectional Lens","Reznik, Gabriela; Massarani, Luisa; Calabrese Barton, Angela","In this paper, the authors seek to analyze the perceptions, motivations and experiences of young women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education projects aiming to incentivize gender equity, based on the theoretical framework of feminist studies on science and intersectionality, as well as academic literature on equity and inclusion in science communication. The following question was considered: How does experience in these projects influence young women's perceptions of belonging in the STEM fields? Working from a qualitative, content analysis approach, the authors conducted 73 questionnaires, 20 interviews, and 4 focus groups with 25 young women who participated in 4 projects developed in public schools in low-income settings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The authors categorized the experience of these young women in their ""individual dimension""--regarding motivations, interests, science identity and future career prospects; ""family dimension""--encouragement and recognition from family members and parents' beliefs and expectations; ""educational dimension""--recognition by the school community, improvement in school performance, and intervention in school spaces; ""project dimension""--representativeness of gender, race, class, and location, development of self-esteem and self-confidence, building of a sense of belonging, and active learning methodologies; and ""social dimension""--domestic work in their daily lives and experiences of discrimination based on gender, race, class and location.

During the academic year 2021-2022 break, it was conducted at Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST)-Gabaldon Campus's College of Education. This study employed a descriptive correlational and descriptive comparative research design. The 151 education students who participated in this study were chosen using a stratified sampling method. According to the study, students received satisfactory to very satisfactory grades during the lockdown. The study also showed that after the lockdown and after the Commission on Higher Education recommended face-to-face classes, the majority of respondents agree that they are academically, socio-emotionally, and physically prepared to go through a face-to-face mode of learning. The majority of them prefer face-to-face classes to any other form of distance learning. The general weighted average of a student is a predictor of academic readiness in face-to-face classes. In addition, students' general weighted averages have direct link to their socio-emotional readiness. Students' profiles, on the other hand, have no impact on their physical readiness. There is no significant difference in student preparation in face-to-face classes when students are grouped by gender, year and section, and civil status.

Gender-Based Salary Differentials among Administrators in Arizona Community Colleges,"Becker, Kristen L.; Beckworth, Lea Andrah","Objective: This research study examined gender wage equality among administrators across Arizona's ten community college districts comprising 19 colleges. Method: Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze salary data. Results: All 19 college campuses evidenced differences in median income between 12-month, full-time women and men. However, when disaggregated by job category, median income of women and men was equal in a number of job categories in several institutions, illustrating the complexity of measuring gender wage equality using descriptive statistics. A multiple regression analysis revealed that only three of the 19 community colleges had gender-based salary differentials. Thus, gender wage equality prevails in most Arizona community colleges despite inconsistent salary schedules among the college districts and no state-level oversight. Contributions: Community colleges provide learning opportunities to a heterogeneous population of 5.4 million students annually.

Estimating the Returns to Education Using a Machine Learning Approach -- Evidence for Different Regions,"Kamdjou, Herve D. Teguim","This article revisits the Mincer earnings function and presents comparable estimates of the average monetary returns associated with an additional year of education across different regions worldwide. In contrast to the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method commonly employed in the literature, this study applied a cutting-edge approach known as Support Vector Regression (SVR), which belongs to the family of machine learning (ML) algorithms. SVR is specifically chosen to address the bias arising from underfitting inherent in OLS. The analysis focuses on recent data spanning from 2010 to 2018, ensuring temporal homogeneity across the examined regions. The findings reveal that each additional year of education, on average, yields a private rate of returns of 10.4%. Notably, Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits the highest returns to education at 17.8%, while Europe demonstrates the lowest returns at 7.2%. Moreover, higher education is associated with the highest returns across the regions, with a rate of 12%, whereas primary education yields returns of 10%. Interestingly, women generally experience higher returns than men, with rates of 10.6 and 10.1%, respectively. Over time, the returns to education exhibit a modest decline, decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.1% per year, while the average duration of education demonstrates an increase of 0.16 years per year (1% per year). The application of the state-of-the-art ML technique, SVR, not only improves the accuracy of estimates but also enhances predictive performance measures such as the coefficient of determination (R[superscript 2]) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when compared to the OLS method. The implications drawn from these findings emphasize the need for expanding university education, as well as investments in primary education, along with significant attention toward promoting girls' education. These findings hold considerable importance for policymakers who are tasked with making informed decisions regarding education expenditure and the implementation of education financing programs.",2023,,Open Education Studies,5,1,,2890016312; EJ1394840,https://doi.org/10.1515/edu-2022-0201,,#153,Kamdjou 2023,"",""

Interpreting research findings impacted by COVID-19 presents unique challenges that will require a deeper understanding as to how the pandemic has affected underserved and underrepresented students studying or unable to study computing. Research Question: Our research question for this study was: ""In what ways has the high school computer science educational ecosystem for students been impacted by COVID-19, particularly when comparing schools based on relative socioeconomic status of a majority of students?"" Methodology: We used an exploratory sequential mixed methods study to understand the types of impacts high school CS educators have seen in their practice over the past year using the CAPE theoretical dissaggregation framework to measure schools' Capacity to offer CS, student Access to CS education, student Participation in CS, and Experiences of students taking CS. Data Collection Procedure: We developed an instrument to collect qualitative data from open-ended questions, then collected data from CS high school educators (n = 21) and coded them across CAPE. We used the codes to create a quantitative instrument. We collected data from a wider set of CS high school educators (n = 185), analyzed the data, and considered how these findings shape research conducted over the last year. Findings: Overall, practitioner perspectives revealed that capacity for CS Funding, Policy & Curriculum in both types of schools grew during the pandemic, while the capacity to offer physical and human resources decreased. While access to extracurricular activities decreased, there was still a significant increase in the number of CS courses offered. Fewer girls took CS courses and attendance decreased. Student learning and engagement in CS courses were significantly impacted, while other noncognitive factors like interest in CS and relevance of technology saw increases.

Results: Boys, pupils who were eligible for free school meals (FSM), pupils from families that were financially struggling, and pupils whose parents had not graduated from university were less engaged and spent less time home learning. Pupils of non-graduate parents found home learning challenging because they were less likely to have someone in their home who could supervise their work. Pupils eligible for FSM and from financially struggling families found home learning challenging because of noise, a lack of space, lack of technology and insufficient internet in their homes.

Determining Lower-Secondary Students' STEM Motivation: A Profile from Turkey,"Dönmez, Ismail; Idin, Sahin; Gürbüz, Seraceddin","The ongoing motivation of students toward the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a process related to their orientation toward those fields and their active participation in related activities. This study aimed to examine the ongoing STEM motivations of lower-secondary school students in a sample from Turkey according to demographic variables. In this study, in which 1926 students from 12 provinces participated, the students' STEM motivations were compared according to the variables of gender, place of residence, grade level, school type, ""mothers' and fathers' education level, and family income level. T-tests and ANOVA testing were used in the analysis process via SPSS package program. As a result, male students' STEM motivations were found to be at higher levels than those of female students. The STEM motivations of gifted students were found to be higher than those of students studying in religiously oriented education institutions. The results also revealed that STEM motivation is directly proportional to the education level of the parents.

"The Relationship between the Leisure Boredom, Leisure Satisfaction, and Smartphone Addiction: A Study on University Students","Serdar, Emrah; Demirel, Mehmet; Harmandar Demirel, Duygu","This study aimed to describe the relationships between leisure boredom, leisure satisfaction, and smartphone addictions among university students. The study sample consisted of 258 participants, 143 males and 115 females, studying at Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Faculty of Sports Sciences. The participants were selected using the purposeful sampling method. Data collection tools involved a personal information form, the ""Leisure Boredom Scale (LBS)"", the ""Leisure Satisfaction Scale (LSS)"" and ""Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV)"". Independent t-Test results revealed a significant difference in SASSV by gender. The MANOVA results indicated a significant difference between the ""Satisfaction"" sub-dimension of LBS and the ""Educational,"" ""Social,"" ""Physical,"" and ""Relaxation"" sub-dimensions of LSS by gender. A significant difference was found between LBS's ""Satisfaction"" sub-dimension and all subdimensions of LSS by income status. According to the ANOVA results, there was no significant relationship between the SAS-SV scores by income status of the participants. Besides, there was a negative and low-level correlation between age and the ""Satisfaction"" sub-dimension of LBS, the ""Physical"" and ""Relaxation"" sub-dimensions of LSS and SAS-SV. There was a negative and low correlation between ""Boredom"" of LBS and ""Psychological,"" ""Social,"" and ""Relaxation"" sub-dimensions of LSS, and there was a positive and low correlation between LBS and SAS-SV. Similarly, a positive and low-level relationship was determined between all sub-dimensions of LSS and SAS-SV. In this sense, it was concluded that the LBS, LSS, and SAS-SV scores differed according to the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants.

Creating More Inclusive Research Environments for Undergraduates,"Haeger, Heather; White, Corin; Martinez, Shantel; Velasquez, Selena","Although there are numerous evidence-based benefits to undergraduate research for new-majority students (students who are from traditionally underrepresented ethnicities, first-generation college students, students from lower-income families, or transfer students) (Hurtado, S. et al., 2011; Kinzie et al., 2008a; Lopatto, 2007), they are less likely to participate or stay in mentored research experiences (Finley & McNair, 2013; Haeger et al., 2015). In order to determine not only who has access to undergraduate research, but to also identify what barriers to full-inclusion exist for new-majority students, we conducted a mixed methods study at a public, Hispanic Serving Institution. We analyzed institutional data to explore who participates in research and who does not. We also specifically sampled a group of students who expressed an interest in research experiences but who never actually participated for our student survey (N=96). Additionally, we conducted five focus groups with students, staff, and faculty (N[approximately]30). We found positive results in the analysis of patterns of participation and found no significant or substantial differences between students who did or did not participate in undergraduate research in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, or first-generation status. The undergraduate researcher population did have significantly more STEM majors and Pell grant recipients. The qualitative analysis identified barriers to participation in research in the following areas: access to research opportunities, programmatic structures, research culture and norms, and campus climate.

Individuals, who try to survive in a mentally and physically challenging and demanding work pace or by being inactive for a long time in front of a computer screen, spend their energy through games, exercises, and physical activities, and can be discharged by relaxing. In this respect, it is possible to evaluate the entire games, exercises, and physical activities as a driving force to gather energy again after a tiring work tempo or as a source of motivation to move away from mental and physical fatigue. It is considered that performing activities such as exercises and playing games by individuals, considering them as a way of life and evaluating the factors, which keep individuals away from these activities, can be possible by explaining individual perceptions on these issues. In the light of these data, the meanings and values associated with the concepts of games and exercises by academics and engineers who live in different cultural structures, who cannot allocate adequate time for games and exercises in a compulsory work tempo, or who can acquire internal and external motivation via games and exercises as well as exercise frequency and playing times.

Engineering Students' Industrial Internship Experience Perception and Satisfaction: Work Experience Scale Validation,"Nogueira, Teresa; Magano, José; Fontão, Eunice; Sousa, Marina; Leite, Angela","An essential aspect of higher education institutions' academic curricula for engineering courses is the students' industrial internship programs. In the literature, it is well accepted that such programs provide valuable learning outcomes and increase the graduates' employment prospects. Thus, it is paramount to evaluate the internship programs' quality to identify opportunities to improve their design and implementation. However, that evaluation typically depends on self-designed academic assessment surveys of questionable validity. The purpose of this paper is to assess engineering students' perceptions of their internship experiences. For that purpose, the validation of a recently adapted version of the Work Experience Questionnaire (WEQ) was carried out on a sample of 447 engineering students that participated in industrial internship programs offered by Portuguese public universities and polytechnic schools. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to confirm the suitability of the model proposed by the WEQ's authors on this study's sample. The psychometric qualities were evaluated through convergent and discriminant validity. The results showed that the model fit the sample well, and convergent and discriminant validity was established.

Factors Associated with the Development of Secondary School Students' Interest towards STEM Studies,"Mitsopoulou, Athina G.; Pavlatou, Evangelia A.","The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive factors that predispose secondary school students' interest in studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields in higher education. For this purpose, an already existing questionnaire was used and modified properly, according to the Greek educational system. The survey was attended by 301 secondary school students, who study in Piraeus, one of the largest cities in Greece. Research findings indicated that the principles of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) are well supported. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time that such a number of variables had been examined, in order to support the SCCT. In particular, very few studies exist in literature--to the best of our knowledge--investigating the effect of more than four factors influencing students' interest towards STEM higher studies. Learning experiences, students' exposure to STEM activities within the school environment and outside of it (OR = 0.071, p = 0.002), as well as their involvement with high difficulty STEM courses (OR = 0.203, p = 0.038), appear to be positively correlated with the development of interest towards studies in the STEM fields. In addition, students from low-income families are more likely to follow STEM studies (OR = 0.198, p = 0.034).

It was determined that the perception of physical health quality of life did not differ between students according to the presence of a current disease and family income. No significant difference was found in psychological life quality perceptions of the students in terms of their gender, current disease and level of income. However, the difference between the scores related to the psychological sub-dimension were found to be significant according to the common effect of gender-health, gender-income and gender-health-income perceptions. The social relations life score average of male students was found to be higher rather than the average score of females, and moreover, average score of the students with low-income perception was found to be higher rather than the average score of students with a perception of medium level of income. The perception of social relations life quality of students with low-income perception and without a current disease was determined to be higher rather than the life quality perceptions of the students with low-income perception. It was determined that the age of CEIT students was not a significant predictor of their perceptions related to physical health, and psychological and environmental life quality. However, the variable of age was specified to be a significant predictor of students' perception on social relations quality of life.",2021,,Journal of Education and Learning,10,4,156-169,2595748651; EJ1309645,,,#191,Öz 2021,"",""
Declining Enrollment in Catholic Schools in the West and Insights from the United States,"Wodon, Quentin","While enrollment in Catholic schools is rising in the global south, it is declining in many Western countries. Providing a quality and holistic education experience remains essential in both developed and developing countries, especially for disadvantaged groups. But in addition, in developed countries, trade-offs may have to be confronted to stem the decline in enrollment that affects the financial sustainability of schools. Building on a presentation made at the closing plenary of OIEC's World Congress in New York, this paper focuses on the United States where enrollment in Catholic schools has been dropping for more than 50 years. In the absence of state support for Catholic schools and in a context of rising operating costs and therefore tuition, the decline in enrollment is due in part to a lack of affordability of schools given high out-of-pocket costs paid by parents. But other factors related to perceptions about Catholic schools also play a role. To stem the decline in enrollment, market research can help, including to assess how favorably Catholic and other types of schools are perceived in the population. The paper relies on data collected for the National Catholic Education Association to compare favorability ratings by type of schools and assess factors associated with these perceptions.",2021,,Journal of Catholic Education,24,1,285-299,2580882465; EJ1308832,,,#192,Wodon 2021,"",""
Returns to Higher Education Subjects and Tiers in China: Evidence from the China Family Panel Studies,"Kang, Lili; Peng, Fei; Zhu, Yu","Using the China Family Panel Studies, we identify the subjects studied by vocational college and university graduates, with the latter group further divided into ordinary and key universities. While the returns are around 8-10% to attending colleges and ordinary universities, there are higher returns of 12-16% per annum to attending the more prestigious key universities. The recent massive expansion of the higher education sector resulted in reduced returns to all HE types, except for graduates who studied subjects other than LEM (law, economics, and management) or STEM (sciences, technology, engineering and math/medicine) at key universities. We further account for selection on observables into subjects and tiers using the doubly robust Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment method (IPWRA) approach.

Gender Differences in Job Searches by New Engineering Graduates in Canada,"Osten, Victoria","Background: This study addresses gender differences in early career experiences in engineering by examining entry-level jobs of Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) graduates in Canada. Purpose/Hypotheses: The study explored how gender shapes entry into this male-dominated occupation in the context of the contemporary knowledge economy. I tested four hypotheses: (H1) There are no gender differences in job search duration and pay for BEng graduates in Canada; (H2) women experience longer job search durations than men and less pay than men; (H3) women's job searches are shorter with less pay than men; (H4) women's job searches are shorter and with the same pay as men's. Design/Method: The study uses data from Statistics Canada National Graduates Survey (2013), feminist theories, and the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model. Results: I found that in the context of the knowledge economy, gender is a significant predictor of labor market outcomes during early career stages for Canadian BEng graduates. Hypotheses H1 and H2 were not supported. I identified partial support for Hypothesis H3 and complete support for H4. In particular, I found that women were hired sooner than men for their first engineering jobs and were paid the same salary as their male counterparts. Conclusions: Based on this study's results, I argue that early career experiences in engineering occupation continue to be defined by the gender of graduates.

Review of Racially Equitable Admissions Practices in STEM Doctoral Programs,"Roberts, Sonia F.; Pyfrom, Elana; Hoffman, Jacob A.; Pai, Christopher; Reagan, Erin K.; Light, Alysson E.","This study reviews literature on racially equitable admissions practices relevant to graduate programs in STEM. Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores correlate more strongly with race, gender, and socioeconomic status than performance metrics for research during or after graduate school. Structural changes to admissions processes that can improve equity of admissions decisions and reduce correlations between admissions decisions and demographic data include using holistic review or composite scores that quantize more components of an application, removing hard limits on course requirements, admitting students as a cohort instead of to individual faculty sponsors, and diversifying admissions committees. Some alternative scoring methods attempt to measure personality traits, but performing these measurements during admissions may present difficulties. Bridge programs--whether they are implemented as collaborations with a minority-serving institution, a personalized educational program for each student admitted to a program, or a stand-alone program before the doctoral degree program--may be able to improve both recruitment and retention of students with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities in their field of study. Finally, financial barriers to applications can disproportionately affect underrepresented applicants due to systemic racism.

The Demand for Private Tutoring in Turkey: An Analysis of Private Tutoring Participation and Spending,"Özdere, Mustafa","This article explores the process, reasons, and determinants of private tutoring as perceived by the high school students in Sanliurfa, Turkey. This is a survey study and the quantitative data for the study was collected with a questionnaire from 1329 high school students during the spring semester in 2019. According to the findings, almost half of the participants reported having received private tutoring at private teaching institutions in the last year. The most popular subjects for private tutoring were math, science, and Turkish. Exam-focused learning, poor classroom teaching were reported as the most important reasons behind receiving private tutoring. The individuals who referred most of the participants to private tutoring were the parents. Besides, it was determined that as age, grade, father and mother's education level, level of income, and parents' belief in the need for education increases, the likelihood of receiving private tutoring increases; as satisfaction level with the school decreases, students are more likely to participate in private tutoring. Also, it was found out that female students spent on private tutoring more than male students. It is concluded that the demand for private tutoring in Turkey is high, and this may be due to the university entrance system based on high-stakes testing.",2021,,Journal of Education and Learning,10,3,96-111,2560393385; EJ1300440,,,#197,Özdere 2021,"",""

Inequalities Reinforced through Online and Distance Education in the Age of COVID-19: The Case of Higher Education in Nepal,"Devkota, Kamal Raj","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered serious disruption in economic, social and cultural dynamics around the globe. Higher education has also suffered undeniable challenges as a result of the pandemic, with thousands of university students all over the world experiencing displacement, disconnect and disengagement from formal learning. In the Global South, online and distance education programmes tend to be concentrated in urban centres. In Nepal, students from rural areas, low socio-economic and gendered spaces, and those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills are experiencing inequalities in access to and participation in online and distance education. This article outlines how universities' shift to online teaching and learning modes due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequalities in Nepal. For the study presented here, the author collected data through ""netnographic"" research methods. These included online interviews with university executives, online focus group discussions (FGDs) with university teachers and students, observation of and participation in online classes and policy conferences and reviews of online documents. The article analyses three overriding mechanisms which are reinforcing social inequalities in higher education: (1) universities' policy trajectories in shifting teaching/learning from face-to-face to online mode; (2) infrastructural limitations challenging effective implementation of online teaching/learning; and (3) a lack of strong pedagogic support for students from disadvantaged and marginalised spaces, including those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills. The author presents a number of tangible strategies for universities to implement in order to mitigate social inequalities.

Understanding Loan Default among Community College Students,"McKinney, Lyle; Gross, Jacob P.; Burridge, Andrea; Inge, Brittany; Williams, Alexander","Objective: The purpose of our study was to identify the factors associated with federal loan default among a nationally-representative sample of community college students. The guiding research question was: For community college students who borrow federal loans, to what extent do demographic, academic, and enrollment characteristics relate to default? Methods: Using data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09), our analysis focused on loan repayment outcomes six years after enrollment for students who began their postsecondary careers at a community college (i.e., a public, two-year institution) and had not transferred to a four-year institution. The analytic methods included descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression. Results: Compared to their peers who did not use federal loans, borrowers were more likely to be female, unmarried, lower-income, a Pell Grant recipient, and enrolled exclusively full-time. Regression results indicated that compared to borrowers still in repayment, defaulters were more likely to be male, first-generation college, lower-income, enrolled in workforce certificate and applied associate degree programs, lateral transfers, and non-completers. Notably, two-thirds of the defaulters had $5,000 or less in outstanding debt. Conclusions: Many of the student groups that have traditionally experienced the lowest rates of success at the community college are also the populations more likely to default on their loans. Relatively low levels of debt can still place severe financial hardship on community college borrowers. We propose several modifications to federal loan policy and institutional practices that could help reduce the number of community college borrowers who default.",2021,,Community College Review,49,3,314-342,2550769214; EJ1298203,https://doi.org/10.1177/00915521211001467,,#201,McKinney 2021,"",""
Adolescents' Experiences of Menarche and Menstruation in Disadvantaged Schools in South Africa: A Qualitative Exploration,"Fennie, Thelma; Moletsane, Mokgadi; Padmanabhanunni, Anita","Purpose: This study explores how menstruation is perceived, experienced and navigated by school-going adolescent girls living in low-to-middle income settings in South Africa. Existing research from developing countries suggest that the onset of menstruation has implications for school attendance and academic performance. There is evidence that menstrual cycle-related symptoms (primarily physical) lead to difficulties in, or interference with, and disengagement from school, social relations, and physical activities (van Ierselet al., 2016; Steiner et al., 2011; Kiesner and Pastore, 2010; Taras, 2005). The onset of menstruation can be shame-inducing and has been associated with anxiety and confusion. Few studies have been conducted on menstruation in countries with a history of sectarian violence and characterised by substantial socio-economic disparities and high levels of gender-based violence. Understanding the experiences of girls in these contexts is important in generating contextually-grounded knowledge and appropriate interventions. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used to collect data from 48 adolescent girls aged 13-16 year-old. A total of six focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire among a purposive sampling method. Data collected were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Written parental consent was obtained for participants under 18 years old. Findings: The findings illustrated complex psychological experiences in response to menarche and menstruation. Experiences of shame in relation to menstruation were aggravated by unsupportive responses from school teachers. Challenges such as scarcity of sanitary products were experienced as creating a barrier for girls' school attendance. Research limitations/implications: Existing research from developing countries suggests that the onset of menstruation has implications for school attendance and academic performance. The research data includes the views of adolescent learners and their negative reactions and positive experiences towards menstruation within the school environment. Practical implications: Given the comparative paucity of research emerging from developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper addresses an important gap in the literature by providing contextually-nuanced information about the menstrual experiences of adolescent girls. The study can further provide information for efforts made by the Department of Education and Department of Health regarding the impact of menstruation on adolescent girls' school attendance. Social implications: This study provides important insights regarding the experiences of South African school girls in relation to menstruation. Although dominant feelings of shame, confusion and disgust may surround menstruation, the study also highlighted potential positive experiences associated with menstruation. Teachers and school administrators need to be oriented towards the needs of adolescent girls if issues regarding poor school attendance are to be addressed. Originality/value: To reduce absenteeism in schools and ensure learners are provided with improved allocation of sanitary products in schools, there is a need for the advocacy regarding sexuality education and resources to promote the psychological health of adolescent girls.",2021,,Health Education,121,4,408-419,2550698505; EJ1297143,https://doi.org/10.1108/HE-12-2020-0122,,#202,Fennie 2021,"",""
Institutional Selectivity and Occupational Outcomes for STEM Graduates: A Generational Comparison,"Kim, Jeongeun; Jung, Jiwon; Mlambo, Yeukai Angela","To increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, U.S. education policy has emphasized the pathways from education to STEM careers. While some scholars argue that employers prioritize the degree, and not institutional affiliation, in hiring graduates, the argument needs to be warranted with more recent data accounting for the changing market structure. Furthermore, some studies found that having a STEM degree matters more than institutional selectivity, particularly for occupational outcomes of women and racial minorities. Yet there is slim empirical evidence to support this conclusion. Using data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, we examine how occupational outcomes are different for different STEM degrees generated by different selectivity of institutions for those who graduated in the 1990s, early and mid-2000s, and late 2000s. Female graduates, although they entered the industry and STEM fields at no different levels from their male counterparts, still earned significantly lower wages. However, we found that the value of institutional selectivity changes over time as it moderates the gender wage gaps in the late 2000s. Minority STEM graduates enjoyed similar salaries to nonminority graduates, but retention in STEM fields after graduation was less likely, but also moderated by the institutional selectivity.",2021,,Journal of Higher Education,92,3,435-464,2540363052; EJ1294767,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2020.1819945,,#203,Kim 2021,"",""

Using a phenomenological approach, the study finds that the program enables community college students to have greater financial freedom and an ability to focus on engineering identity. In addition, the SSTEM program enhances student connections with STEM faculty, program staff, and peers. The study highlights the need for creating spaces for engineering identity development, developing connections between faculty, staff, and students, and enhancing transfer connections through different experiences. Future research might look to longitudinal designs and investigate additional contexts, engineering disciplines, gender differences, and programmatic structures to add nuance to these findings. The study suggests that practitioners might frame SSTEM and engineering experiences as opportunities for financial freedom and identity development and make further enhancements to transfer connections to four-year institutional partners. In terms of policy, the study suggests that policymakers consider identity development experiences an important aspect of funding SSTEM programs while enhancing programmatic support services available to students and placing greater emphasis on the collaborative actions, planned activities, and power dynamics between two- and four-year institutions funded by the SSTEM program.",2021,,Education Policy Analysis Archives,29,29,,2528162570; EJ1288417,,,#205,Rodriguez 2021,"",""

Does the Match between Gender and Race of Graduate Teaching Assistants and Undergraduates Improve Student Performance in Introductory Biology?,"Lee, Star W.; Ing, Marsha","Research suggests there are potential benefits to students when taught by instructors who share the same gender and/or race/ethnicity.

Given that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) GTAs spend a significant amount of time with undergraduates, measurable impacts on student outcomes have the potential to contribute to the success of undergraduates who have been underrepresented in STEM fields. This study evaluated the effects on academic performance of GTA (n = 50) matching for first-year students (n = 976) in an introductory biology lab course at a Hispanic-serving institution.

Using Machine Learning to Identify the Most At-Risk Students in Physics Classes,"Yang, Jie; DeVore, Seth; Hewagallage, Dona; Miller, Paul; Ryan, Qing X.; Stewart, John","Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to predict students' performance in an introductory physics class. The prediction model classified students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a grade of C, D, F or withdraw from the class. Early prediction could better allow the direction of educational interventions and the allocation of educational resources. However, the performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B, or C (the ABC outcome) or if they would receive a D, F or withdraw (W) from the class (the DFW outcome) because the outcome is substantially unbalanced with between 10% to 20% of the students receiving a D, F, or W. This work presents techniques to adjust the prediction models and alternate model performance metrics more appropriate for unbalanced outcome variables. These techniques were applied to three samples drawn from introductory mechanics classes at two institutions (N=7184, 1683, and 926). Applying the same methods as the earlier study produced a classifier that was very inaccurate, classifying only 16% of the DFW cases correctly; tuning the model increased the DFW classification accuracy to 43%. Using a combination of institutional and in-class data improved DFW accuracy to 53% by the second week of class.

After highlighting the theoretical reasons why role models, mentors, and the media could alter a child's life trajectory, the authors report a descriptive analysis showing differences over time and across income class in exposure to these influences. They show that compared to children four decades ago, today's children spend much more time in school and with media, and less time with parents, peers, and other adults. They also show that young children with low socioeconomic status (SES) spend considerably more time exposed to media and considerably less time in school, as compared to higher-SES children, and encounter very different role models in their neighborhoods. Kearney and Levine focus on large-scale analyses that credibly claim that a specific intervention had a causal impact on children's outcomes. The beneficial impact of role models is evident in teachers' ability to positively influence the educational performance and career decisions of students who share the teacher's gender or race. Children who participate in formal mentoring programs see improvements in their school performance and are more likely to avoid the criminal justice system. Exposure to specific media content with positive messaging can lead to improved social outcomes. The authors conclude that interventions designed to improve the social influences encountered by children can make an important contribution toward the goal of increasing rates of upward mobility for children in low-income homes in the United States.",2020,,Future of Children,30,1,83-106,2459015999; EJ1262726,,,#211,Kearney 2020,"",""
Student-Faculty Interaction and Discrimination from Faculty in STEM: The Link with Retention,"Park, Julie J.; Kim, Young K.; Salazar, Cinthya; Hayes, Shannon","Previous studies have documented student-faculty interaction in STEM, but fewer studies have specifically studied negative forms of interaction such as discrimination from faculty. Using a sample of 562 STEM undergraduates from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, we use hierarchical generalized linear modeling to investigate various types of student-faculty interaction in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and in particular, the link between discrimination from faculty and retention in STEM. While Black students interacted more frequently with faculty, they were also most likely to report experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination. Overall, female, Black, and Latinx students were more likely to leave STEM by the fourth year of college than male, White, and Asian American peers. Feeling that professors made a student feel uncomfortable due to race/ethnicity was negatively linked with STEM retention.

Learners' Educational Aspirations in South Africa: The Role of the Home and the School,"Fadiji, Angelina Wilson; Reddy, Vijay","An extensive body of research exists on the background characteristics that predict learner achievement. However, in South Africa, little attention has been paid to the level of educational aspirations and the factors that shape the level of aspirations.

Using a nationally representative sample of 11,969 learners (females = 5,248; mean age = 15.7 years) from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the statistical analysis technique of structural equation modelling (SEM), we investigated the relationships between parental involvement, school climate and learner educational aspirations. Our study showed that students from low socio-economic status (SES) homes and schools had lower educational aspirations. We also found positive relationships between both positive and negative school climate and learner aspirations. A surprising finding was that parental involvement did not have any influence on shaping learner aspirations. The findings indicate a need to improve educational resources at schools as well as the school climate, as schools matter for learners in low-income countries.

Shaping Educational Expectations: The Perspectives of 13-Year-Olds and Their Parents,"Smyth, Emer","Educational expectations and the way in which they shape actual outcomes act as an important vehicle for the intergenerational reproduction of social inequality. This article draws on rich information from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study to explore the factors influencing the educational expectations of 13-year-old young people and their parents. The findings point to high levels of expectations among parents but one-third of young people are found to hold lower expectations than their parents. Both sets of expectations are shaped by parental education, social class and household income, though parental expectations are more strongly structured by social background than those of young people. The article seeks to contribute to the literature on educational expectations in three interrelated ways. Firstly, it focuses on a phase of schooling, the transition to secondary education, which represents a time of significant change in young people's learning experiences, and transition difficulties are found to dampen their expectations. Secondly, the analyses unpack the extent to which signals from the school influence parental perspectives, with academic achievement, child attitudes to maths, ability group assignment and teacher reprimands emerging as significant drivers of parental views of their children's potential.

From Major Preferences to Major Choices: Gender and Logics of Major Choice,"Quadlin, Natasha","Research shows that college students choose majors for a variety of reasons. Some students are motivated by potential economic returns, others want to take engaging classes, and others still would like opportunities to help people in their jobs. But how do these preferences map onto students' actual major choices? This question is particularly intriguing in light of gender differences in fields of study, as men and women may take divergent pathways in pursuit of the same outcome. Using data from the Pathways through College Study (N = 2,639), I show that men and women choose very different majors even when they cite the same major preferences--what I call gendered logics of major choice. In addition, I use earnings data from the American Community Survey to assess how these gendered logics of major choice may be associated with broader patterns of earnings inequality. I find that among men and women who have the same major preferences, men's major choices are tied to significantly higher prospective earnings than women's major choices. This finding demonstrates that the ways men and women translate their preferences into majors are unequal from an earnings perspective.

The Patriotic Attitudes of the Prospective Teachers,"Faiz, Melike; Avci, Emine Karasu","The concept of patriotism can be defined as loving the homeland and making sacrifices for it. From this perspective, it can be said that the concept of patriotism has a function of uniting and integrating the people who live on the same land and gives people an understanding which is proud of its history. Patriotism is also a dynamic concept. Because it is the behavior, consciousness and understanding that we put forward in every moment of life, in every field and in all our actions. It is also the basic condition of being a good and effective citizen. With the impact of globalization and technology, while the world is rapidly becoming a big village, civil wars, migrations, economic crises, hunger, famine and confusion in various continents and countries of the world increase the need for protection of national values and reveal the importance of patriotic education. On the other hand, patriotic education is aimed to be provided to the students who will be the citizens of the future through the education programs in the schools. For this reason, determining the patriotism attitudes of the teachers who will gain the patriotism value to the students is important in determining the deficiencies and taking measures in the acquisition of this value. In this context, the aim of the study was to reveal the pre-service teachers' patriotic attitudes. In the research, screening model which is one of the quantitative research types was used. The study group of the research is composed of Social Studies, Turkish, Science, Mathematics, Primary School and Preschool teachers who are studying in the 3rd and 4th grades of a state university in the fall semester of 2019-2020 academic year.

The digital platforms, which are used for those diverse aims, influence our lives and especially create addiction for students. In this context, the students of vocational schools may be negatively influenced by the intense usage of digital platforms. This study in this regard aims to examine the digital addiction levels of vocational school students and the degree of this addiction based on their genders, departments, school years and levels of income. A survey method was used in this study. 318 foundation degree students from different departments at Sakarya University and Sakarya University of Applied Sciences participated in this study. In order to collect data, a demographics form and the ""Digital Addiction Scale"", developed by Kesici and Tunc (2018), were used. The results of the study suggest that the participants have a medium-level addiction. While the students have a mid-level addiction at overuse, non-restraint, emotion situation and sticking sub-dimensions, they have a low-level addiction at inhibiting the flow of life. The digital addiction of vocational school students does not differ according to their school years, genders and income levels of their families but differ by their departments. It is advised that for today's students to use digital courses in an accurate and effective way, new educational methods should be used, and students, parents, teachers and administrators need to be trained to learn the negative psychological and physical effects caused by digital addictions such as the internet, smartphones, computers and social media addictions.",2019,,International Journal of Contemporary Educational Research,6,1,100-109,2461125980; EJ1219510,,,#233,Bagci 2019,"",""
Moving beyond the STEM/Non-STEM Dichotomy: Wage Benefits to Increasing the STEM-Intensities of College Coursework and Occupational Requirements,"Light, Audrey; Rama, Apoorva","Using a sample of college graduates from the NLSY97, we introduce a new approach to assessing wage benefits of STEM training, STEM jobs, and the match between the two: rather than classify individuals dichotomously as STEM or non-STEM, we measure the STEM-intensities of both their college coursework and their occupational requirements. While the orthodox approach simply predicts that 'STEM pays,' we find that workers at the top of both gender-specific STEM-intensity distributions are predicted to out-earn their counterparts at the bottom by a substantial margin -- even when we condition on their dichotomous STEM classification -- but that predicted log-wages do ""not"" increase monotonically with STEM-intensity throughout the entire joint distribution.",2019,,Education Economics,27,4,358-382,2461123901; EJ1217633,https://doi.org/10.1080/09645292.2019.1616078,,#234,Light 2019,"",""
Dichotomy in Ethical Perceptions of Business Students: An Emerging Country Perspective,"Azhar, Sarwar Mehmood; Tashfeen, Rubeena; Khalid, Jaweria; Azhar, Tashfeen Mahmood","Purpose: The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for 2016 shows Pakistan as among the more corrupt nations in the world with a ranking of 117 among 176 countries surveyed. This situation raises concerns about members of the society and especially about the business communities. This paper aims to examine whether the tendency to corruption is also prevalent amongst business students, the future leaders and executives of business organizations. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses survey questionnaires in the manner of Parsa and Lankford (1999) to examine the ethical levels of business students. It uses Levene's (1960) tests for equality of variances and the t-test for equality of means to examine whether there are difference in the ethical perceptions between: bachelors (BBA) and graduate (MBA) students; business students who have taken the ethics course and those who have not; and female and male students. The authors also examine the overall ethical perceptions of business students. Findings: The results show that students seem to make a clear distinction in respect of what they consider as acceptable and unacceptable ethical behavior. They would not indulge in behavior that directly falls within the category of stealing, misusing of company's resources and undertaking actions that are wrong or dishonest, which may stem from their religious indoctrination. However, they would consider as acceptable behavior the overlooking of safety violations, not telling on peers; and fudging of the truth to get the job done. The latter attitude appears to be in line with business objectives of achieving targets irrespective of the means employed and that inform business education. We do not find any differences between the behavior of women and men which may be the outcome of the same religious indoctrination and educational perceptions. While there is a difference in the ethical perceptions between students who have taken the ethics course and those who have not, the course is not able to counter the lack of ethics among business students. There is a need for some stronger measures to inculcate a set of ethical values within students. However, we did find that some of the unethical behavior is diluted at the MBA level in comparison to BBA students. Originality/value: This study provides new insights into the ethical perceptions of students in an Islamic emerging country. There is a conflict between ethics conveyed through Islamic precepts, and the ethics of business education with a focus on profits/revenues, costs, performance and competition that endorses a Machiavellian attitude of achieving goals at any cost and the love of money (Tang and Chen, 2008). It is the first study to suggest a differentiation in the ethical behavior of business students that exhibit both ethical and unethical behavior. There appears to be a clear segregation between what students deem as acceptable and unacceptable ethical behavior that may result from their personal/religious beliefs, and their business attitudes that strongly informs their ethical behavior. It provides a basis for developing more customized and effective ethics courses in Pakistan and suggests more importantly that ethics needs to be integrated into business concepts imparted in business programs at universities.",2019,,Journal of International Education in Business,12,1,43-64,2461120063; EJ1214013,https://doi.org/10.1108/JIEB-05-2018-0015,,#235,Azhar 2019,"",""

Using data from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey Cohort 2009 (FACES 2009) (N = 939), a national data set of predominantly low-income children attending Head Start, two models were compared: (1) a lagged path model predicting subsequent academic skills based on prior IC skills and (2) a cross-lagged path model predicting reciprocal associations between IC and academic skills. Our results showed a better model fit for the cross-lagged path model with bidirectional associations. Prior IC predicted subsequent early reading and math skills during the preschool and kindergarten years; simultaneously, prior early math skills, but not reading skills, predicted subsequent IC. The reciprocal associations between IC and early math were consistently identified for multiple groups of children, regardless of their gender or home-language use (i.e., monolingual versus dual language learners).

Racial gaps in representation are more salient among programmers than in the overall technology labour force; in addition, we document a stable or increasing gender gap across all races in computer science. However, these demographic shifts are not always consistent with either a pipeline argument that there are insufficient supplies of potential underrepresented programmers or a wage explanation. Hispanic males, for example, have had increasing rates of computer science degree completions yet decreasing representation in the programmer labour force. On the other hand, White females have had decreasing representation among both degrees and the labour force despite comparatively high wages in the technology sector.

Background: Women and low socio-economic classes have historically been under-represented, both as students and teachers. Various policies and measures are being put in place internationally to raise their standing, equity, and success as they progress in their careers. To be effective, the after effects of these policies must be investigated and understood.

These workshops are an extension of the Peer-led Team Learning (PLTL) SI. In addition to peer-facilitated problem-solving, we incorporated two components inspired by learning sciences: (1) training in research-based study skills, and (2) evidence-based interventions targeting psychological and emotional support. Here we use an explanatory mixed methods approach to measure the impact of the STEM-Dawgs Workshops, with a focus on four sub-populations that are historically underrepresented in Chemistry: underrepresented minorities, females, low-income students, and first-generation students. Specifically, we compared three groups of students in the same General Chemistry course: students in general chemistry and not the workshops (""Gen Chem students""), students in the workshops (""STEM-Dawgs""), and students who volunteered for the workshops but did not get in (""Volunteers""). We tested hypotheses with regression models and conducted a series of focus group interviews with STEM-Dawgs. Compared to the Gen Chem population, the STEM-Dawg and Volunteer populations were enriched with students in all four under-represented sub-populations. Compared to Volunteers, STEM-Dawgs had increased exam scores, sense of belonging, perception of relevance, self-efficacy, and emotional satisfaction about chemistry. URM STEM-Dawgs had lower failure rates, and exam score achievement gaps that impacted first-generation and female Gen Chem students were eliminated in the STEM-Dawg population. Finally, female STEM-Dawgs had an increased sense of belonging and higher emotional satisfaction about chemistry than women Volunteers. Focus groups suggested that successes came in part from the supportive peer-learning environment and the relationships with peer facilitators. Together, our results indicate that this supplementary instruction model can raise achievement and improve affect for students who are underrepresented in chemistry.",2018,,Chemistry Education Research and Practice,19,3,846-866,2101885485; EJ1184044,https://doi.org/10.1039/c8rp00044a,,#254,Stanich 2018,"",""
Reverse and Horizontal Transfer-Out Behavior at Four-Year Institutions,"Ishitani, Terry; Flood, Lee","The number of transfer students in U.S. postsecondary education has been growing. Of students who transferred from four-year institutions, 52 percent transferred to two-year institutions. Although transferring is an imperative for many students, little about the whereabouts of transfer students is known beyond descriptive statistics. Coupled with nationally represented data, this study investigated student transfer behavior at four-year institutions. The focal point of the current study was patterns of transfer, such as reverse and horizontal transfer. After controlling for student and institutional characteristics, it became evident that academic and social integration had significant effects on preventing students from transferring, particularly reverse transferring. Overall, this study suggests that transfer decisions are primarily the students' own decisions rather than the effects of institutional characteristics. Along with introducing the Reverse Transfer Efficiency Act of 2017, this study is an important contribution to current policy discussions about transfer.",2018,,College and University,93,2,16-28,2101400592; EJ1182345,,,#255,Ishitani 2018,"",""
Analyzing Process of Problem Solving with Group via Statistical Discourse Analysis,"Toraman, Çetin; Karadag, Engin","The aim of this research is to examine the effects of various variables (cognitive flexibility, school achievement, physics course success, gender, popularity, family income level) and communication that occur between students in the problem solving process of the high school students. The research, which was designed according to the mixed research approach, was carried out with 80 tenth grade students determined by high school education and purposive sampling. It is given in research; the problem form was obtained by cognitive flexibility scale and observations, the discourses obtained from the observations were coded, and the data obtained from the other variables were categorized. Problem solving situation is coded with rubric in accordance with ordinal variable. Data is analyzed by modelling with multi-level sequential logistic regression and sequential logistic regression analysis. Findings showed that obtaining a creative solution to the problem is related to the success of the physics course related to solution of the problem rather than the general academic achievement, it is related to cognitive flexibility level, gender, family income level. The higher the level of cognitive flexibility and the level of family income, the higher likelihood of reaching creative solutions. The probability of women reaching creative solution is lower than men. The number of discourses and rudely disagreeing discourses in schools with low achievement levels are higher than those of successful schools. While presenting suggestions that are modelled as descriptive in reaching creative solutions, discourse of ignorance is meaningful variable; approval, politely disagreeing, rudely disagreeing are not meaningful variables.",2018,,Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice,18,2,229-252,2228636599; EJ1201846,,,#256,Toraman 2018,"",""

Investigation of Parents' Expectations from Mathematics Education in Turkey,"Aytekin, Cahit; Baltaci, Serdal; Yildiz, Avni","In this study, the expectations of middle school students' parents regarding to ""conceptual understanding and active student participation"" ""positive attitude and behavior attitude"" and ""authority and rule-oriented teaching"" were examined. A valid and reliable threefactor instrument developed by the Aytekin, Baltaci, Altunkaya, Kiymaz and Yildiz (2016) was used in collecting parents' expectations. 749 parents participated in the study. It was found that the variables of parental gender, parental age range, and monthly income of the parents, level of loving mathematics and level of helping the child have no significant effect on the expectations. The university graduates had less authority and rule-oriented teaching expectation than the remaining parents. Besides, it is seen that the 5th grade parents had higher expectations of conceptual understanding and active participation and positive attitude and behavior than the other parents. It was determined that parents with very good past math achievement had higher expectations for ""conceptual understanding and active participation"" and ""positive attitude and behavior"". On the other hand, it is clear that the mathematical success perceived by the child's parents will have an effect on the behavior of the parents. A student who believes in learning mathematics through passive listening and memorizing rules can be more easily directed, if parent has a high expectation of active participation and conceptual learning.

Cortisol Moderates the Relation between Physical Peer Victimization and Physical Aggression in Preschoolers Attending High-Quality Child Care: Evidence of Differential Susceptibility across Informants,"Vaillancourt, Tracy; Brittain, Heather; Haltigan, John D.; Ostrov, Jamie M.; Muir, Cameron","We examined whether the moderating role of cortisol in the relation between physical peer victimization and physical aggression was better accounted for by a diathesis-stress model or a differential susceptibility model using a multi-informant approach (direct observations, teacher reports, and parent reports) of 198 preschool-aged children attending high-quality child care. Controlling for the influence of household income, hours per week in child care, and child age, we found that our results supported a differential susceptibility effect for boys but not for girls. This effect was replicated within reporters (observer and parent reports) and across reporters (parent-reported victimization and teacher-rated aggression) but for boys only. At higher levels of peer victimization, lower levels of basal cortisol were associated with higher levels of physical aggression, but, at lower levels of peer victimization, lower levels of basal cortisol were associated with lower levels of physical aggression. Furthermore, at higher levels of peer victimization, higher levels of basal cortisol were associated with lower levels of physical aggression, but, at lower levels of peer victimization, higher levels of basal cortisol were associated with higher levels of physical aggression.

Investigating the Smart Phone Addictions of Vocational School Students from Different Variables,"Bagci, Hakki; Peksen, Muhammed Fatih","Nowadays, smartphones are used by individuals of all ages for communication, messaging, online or offline gaming, social media browsing and information access. Smartphones, which are frequently used by students for any purpose, increase the level of smartphones dependency of the students and affect them negatively. The purpose of this study is to examine the smartphone dependency levels of vocational college students. Students' smartphone dependency levels are examined according to whether they have a social media account, their smartphone usage goals, smartphone usage times, gender, class degree and family income levels. The survey model was used to collect the research data. Participants of this study are students who are studied at different vocational colleges in Sakarya University at the academic year of 2017-2018.

The study was conducted with 820 students studying at different departments of the Faculty of Education at Gaziantep University, during the 2014-2015 academic year. In the study, data was collected using the Thinking Styles Scale and the Need for Cognition Scale, while demographic details of students were obtained through a Personal Information Form created by the researcher. Pearson's correlation test, t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed in SPSS 20 software for data analysis. According to the findings of the study, students of the education faculty use the legislative thinking style the most and the conservative thinking style the least among the others given in the Thinking Styles Scale. According to the findings regarding the relationship between thinking styles and the need for cognition; the Thinking Styles Scale shows that there are significant differences between the legislative, executive, judicial, hierarchic, oligarchic, anarchic, local, internal, liberal dimensions of thinking and the need for cognition, while there is no significant difference between the global and conservative thinking styles and the need for cognition. It is seen that legislative, executive and hierarchic dimensions of the Thinking Styles Scale differ significantly according to the gender variable. Local, conservative and oligarchic dimensions of the Thinking Style Scale also show significant differences according to the department where the students study. This differentiation is seen in favor of the classroom teaching department against the Psychological Counselling and Guidance (PCG) students in the local thinking style dimension, while it is more favorable for the mathematics teaching department against the PCG students in both conservative and oligarchic dimensions. It is also seen that the legislative and local dimensions of the Thinking Styles Scale differ significantly according to the monthly incomes of families. This differentiation is in favor of the 2000 TL and above income group in each of these thinking styles, against those with monthly incomes between 500-1000 TL. On the other hand, the place where families have resided the longest, which is often the same place where students have completed their secondary education, do not differ significantly according to class levels. The Need for Cognition Scale scores differ significantly in favor of the 4th grade students according to the class level variable. A similar significant differentiation in the Need for Cognition Scale scores is also seen in favor of urban areas (provinces) against rural areas (villages) according to the place where families have resided the longest.

We employ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions to identify the determinants of basic and motivational satisfaction in the workplace and an ordered logit model for overall job satisfaction. Results do not allow us to confirm Herzberg's factor differentiation for Spanish PhD holders since the factors of basic motivation (including salary or working conditions--needs of ""safety"") have a bearing on all types of job satisfaction (and not solely on the basic satisfaction of PhD holders).

Representation and Salary Gaps by Race-Ethnicity and Gender at Selective Public Universities,"Li, Diyi; Koedel, Cory","We use data from 2015-2016 to document faculty representation and wage gaps by race-ethnicity and gender in six fields at selective public universities. Consistent with widely available information, Black, Hispanic, and female professors are underrepresented and White and Asian professors are overrepresented in our data. Disadvantaged minority and female underrepresentation is driven predominantly by underrepresentation in science and math intensive fields. A comparison of senior and junior faculty suggests a trend toward greater diversity, especially in science and math intensive fields, because younger faculty are more diverse. However, Black faculty are an exception. We decompose racial-ethnic and gender wage gaps and show that academic field, experience, and research productivity account for most or all of the gaps.

Gender Inequality and Disabled Inclusivity in Accounting Higher Education and the Accounting Profession during Financial Crises,"Lodh, Suman; Nandy, Monomita","In this article, the authors find that, during financial crises, the wage gap between female and male accounting professionals declines and gender inequality in higher education is affected. In addition, less support and lower wages for disabled accounting professionals demotivate disabled students in accounting higher education.

Examination of Children Decision Making Using Clues during the Logical Reasoning Process,"Çelik, Meryem","Logical reasoning is the process of thinking about a problem and finding the most effective solution. Children's decision-making skills are part of their cognitive development and are also indicative. The purpose of this study was to examine children's decision-making skills using clues in logical reasoning based on various variables. The study was conducted according to the relational screening model. A purposive sampling method was used in the research. The study group consisted of 119 children attending the kindergarten. Big Math observation form developed by Ginsburg et al. (2003) and adapted to Turkish by Çelik (2012) was used as data collection tool. For this purpose, the children were given two sets of Big Math quadruple clue cards. The data of the study were collected in May 2016/2017 academic year. Percentage and frequency values of the obtained data were calculated. In addition, Mann-Whitney-U test and Kruskal-Wallis test analysis were conducted to measure the differences between groups and the relationships between variables.

Efforts of NNCAE in Repositioning Adult and Non-Formal Education for Relevance in Nigeria: The Gender Perspective,"Ayimoro, Oluwatoyin Dorcas","Adult and Non-formal education provides the opportunities of responding to individual and societal needs through relevant training and education especially, as being challenged by constant technological change and novel knowledge. Adult Education is thus, problem solving. A major problem solving component of Adult Education is the potentials inherent in lifelong learning. The Nigerian National Council for Adult Education anchors both academic and practice of Adult Education in the nation initially, before a seeming decline in its activities. But since the split between the academic and practical practitioners had occurred, Adult Education had received a setback in its programmes. The question is, at a time of high level of inequality, unemployment and underemployment which may be connected with societal inhibitions and the skills received at various educational institutions of which women are the most vulnerable, what are the efforts of NNCAE in redeeming its professional ethics of providing the right education to the citizenry at a dire need? It is in response to these that this paper assesses and critiques the efforts of NNCAE in repositioning Adult and Non-formal Education for relevance in Nigeria. This paper posits that NNCAE is capable of enhancing a better recognition for Adult Education discipline in Nigerian Universities through its ""town gown"" activities as it will educate the people on the need for gender equity and enhanced skills that could stem unemployment under employment and gender inequity in the society.",2017,,European Journal of Educational Sciences,4,2,59-73,2396843721; EJ1236149,,,#278,Ayimoro 2017,"",""

Private Schooling and Labour Market Outcomes,"Green, Francis; Henseke, Golo; Vignoles, Anna","Though a relative small part of the school sector, private schools have an important role in British society, and there are policy concerns about their negative effect on social mobility. Other studies show that individuals who have attended a private school go on to have higher levels of educational achievement, are more likely to secure a high-status occupation and also have higher wages. In this article we contribute new evidence on the magnitude of the wage premium, and address a puzzle found in previous studies: how to explain the direct pay premium whereby privately educated male workers have higher wages even than their similarly educated peers. It is commonly conjectured that the broader curriculum that private schools are able to deliver, coupled with the peer pressures of a partially segregated section of society, help to inculcate cultural capital, including some key ""non-cognitive"" attributes. We focus here on leadership, organisational participation and an acceptance of hard work. We find that privately educated workers are in jobs that require significantly greater leadership skills, offer greater organisational participation and require greater work intensity. These associations are partially mediated by educational achievement. Collectively these factors contribute little, however, to explaining the direct pay premium. Rather, a more promising account arises from the finding that inclusion of a variable for industry reduces the private school premium to an insignificant amount, which is consistent with selective sorting of privately educated workers into high-paying industries.",2017,,British Educational Research Journal,43,1,7-28,1895987137; EJ1128543,https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3256,,#282,Green 2017,"",""

In accordance with the above purpose, the answers to the following questions are sought. 1. What are the lifelong learning tendency levels of midwifery and nursing students? 2. Are there any significant differences in lifelong learning tendency levels between the groups of students that may be formed according to demographic attributes? This is a descriptive study for a situation determination, on which a scanning model is grounded. The target population of this study consists of 356 students enrolled in midwifery and nursing departments. None of the sampling methods are used in this research as the researchers aimed to reach all 356 individuals in the target population. The data were collected from 333 students, although the data concerning 14 students were not included in the analysis due to a lack of response.

An overall analysis of the job seeking process shows that compared to college students with rural household registrations, college students with urban household registrations first showed a greater inclination to choosing management and technical professions. Furthermore, they obtain better quality positions by investing more economic resources, making more effective use of information channels, and using less time for job seeking. Finally, a study of the factors impacting starting salaries found that gender factors have a greater impact on college students with urban household registrations, the contribution rate of academic degrees toward starting salary is greater for college students with rural household registrations, and the intergenerational transmission of extent of education and income is more significant for graduates with urban household registrations.

Postgraduate Wage Premiums and the Gender Wage Gap in Canada,"Waite, Sean","Since the 1990s, enrolment in postgraduate programs has increased significantly in Canada. In more recent years, this has led to concerns regarding overproduction and the labour market outcomes of those with postgraduate education. Women have played an important role in this growth, but questions remain as to whether women's progress into the highest levels of education has helped ameliorate their wage disadvantage relative to men. Using the 2011 National Household Survey, this study finds large wage premiums for completing master's and doctoral degrees for both men and women, especially in younger cohorts; however, there are important differences by field of study. The gender wage gap is smaller for women with master's degrees than for those with bachelor or doctoral degrees.

Among both well-represented (WR; n = 3,444) and underrepresented minority (URM; n = 225) respondents, faculty career choice was positively associated with desire for autonomy and partner opportunity and negatively associated with desire for leadership opportunity. Differences between groups in reasons endorsed included: variety, prestige, salary, family influence, and faculty advisor influence.

Association between Physical Fitness and Academic Achievement in a Cohort of Danish School Pupils,"Andersen, Mikkel P.; Mortensen, Rikke N.; Vardinghus-Nielsen, Henrik; Franch, Jesper; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Bøggild, Henrik","Background: Time spent on physical activity in elementary school has been altered to improve core academics. However, little is known about the relationship between physical fitness and academic achievement. We examined the association between physical fitness and academic achievement and investigated the influence of parental socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Methods: Participants were 542 girls and 577 boys aged 13 to 15 residing in the Danish municipality of Aalborg. A watt-max cycle ergometer test was completed to evaluate physical fitness as represented by VO[subscript 2]max (mL·kg[superscript -1]·min[superscript -1]). Academic achievement was measured 1 school year later through a series of mandatory exams within the humanities, sciences, and all obligatory defined exams. Parental income and education were drawn from nationwide registers. Linear regression models were used to investigate the association. Results: Adjusting for ethnicity and parental socioeconomic status, the effect size of the humanities was 0.08 grad/VO[subscript 2]max (95% Cl:0.05 to 0.11) for girls and 0.06 grad/VO[subscript 2]max (95% Cl:0.03 to 0.08) for boys.

The Impact of Different Demographic Variables on Determinants of University Choice Decision: A Study on Business Administration Students of the Foundation Universities in Istanbul,"Aydin, Oya Tamtekin; Bayir, Firat","By examining the relevant literature, many factors can be determined as effecting factors on university choice process. However, existing literature does not fully explore the effect of demographic variables on these factors. This research is aimed at identifying the relationship between university selection criteria and demographic variables, defined in the study as gender, family income level, types of high school graduated from, and whether working or not during the education period in the business administration departments of the foundation universities in Istanbul. The study was designed by descriptive research method using a survey. The face-to-face questionnaires were conducted to the students during the 2014-2015 academic year of selected foundation universities. Convenience sampling method was used to determine the participants of the study. A total of 600 questionnaire forms were delivered to the students in these universities, the 510 questionnaire forms were counted as valid. At the end of the study, based on the relevant literature, 13 determinants that play an influential role on students' decisions were obtained.

The Interaction of Economic Livelihood Strategies and Literacy and Numeracy Practices of Urban Gambian Women with Low Educational Attainments,"Njie, Haddy","This paper is based on eight months of ethnographic fieldwork in the periphery of Banjul, the capital of The Gambia. It explores relations between the gender roles of women with modest educational achievement and their uses of literacy and numeracy. The paper applied New Literacy Studies theoretical framework of literacy as a ""social practice"". Data was collected from 120 women with low and no educational qualifications in the urban Gambia who participated in the three different stages of the study, namely: survey, focus group discussions and individual interviews along with participant observations. The study data was analyzed through the use of both qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques. The survey data was analyzed and presented in the form of descriptive statistics for illuminating the demographic characteristics of the study participants. The analysis of the qualitative data was done through the use of both inductive and deductive coding strategies for identifying common themes and patterns across the different data sources. In this paper, a detailed ethnographic account of four cases of women who participated in the study is provided for illuminating the literacy environment as well as the circumstances subsumed within it that induce or suppress literacy practices among women of limited educational qualifications in The Gambia. The study uncovers instances where women's uses of literacy and numeracy added greater efficiency in their economic activities and highlight other scenarios where literate women did not rely on those skills in the exercise of their economic activities. Findings confirm New Literacy Studies (NLS) theoretical claim that literacy skills do not automatically create their uses. Rather, literacy uses are a product of their socio-cultural context of their application. From the four cases reported here, this paper substantially illuminates women's economic livelihood strategies, the contextual barriers they encounter in performing their economic roles and their opportunities and limitations for using and sharpening their written numeracy and literacy skills. Knowledge concerning the interaction of women's economic livelihoods and literacy uses constitutes critical information that could inform adult education and economic policy development in Sub-Saharan Africa.",2016,,International Journal of Education and Literacy Studies,4,3,73-87,1941338767; EJ1149186,,,#300,Njie 2016,"",""

Findings led us to hypothesize that perceived social recognition explains the maximum variance. Later, 126 academicians were surveyed. Findings: Results of regression analysis rejected the null hypothesis. The parental attitude of IS academicians, their engagement and perceived social recognition significantly predicted their aspiration in enrolling their children in IS.

Factors Associated with College Coping among High Achieving Scholarship Recipients from Adverse Backgrounds,"Wolniak, Gregory C.; Rekoutis, Panagiotis","Background/Context: Studies have shown that students from low-income backgrounds are particularly at risk of not succeeding in college and that, once in college, students from the lowest socioeconomic groups complete college at a fraction the rate of student from the highest socioeconomic groups. College presents unique challenges for students from adverse backgrounds. To adequately support such students in college, we must first understand the kinds of programs and support services that enable students from adverse backgrounds to cope with stressors encountered during college. Purpose /Objective: The purpose of the study was to improve understanding of the factors that enable students from adverse backgrounds to cope with the college environment in pursuit of a bachelor's degree. The analyses addressed the following research questions: (1) Among students from adverse backgrounds, do the services and supports encountered during college enhance their ability to positively cope with the college environment? (2) Are the associations between college services and supports, and positively coping with the college environment conditional on gender, identifying as a student of color, year in college, or level of adversity experienced prior to college? Research Design: The study utilized multivariate regression techniques to analyze survey data. The first analytic stage involved regressing each of the three Coping with the College Environment Scales on distinct blocks of variables. The second analytic stage tested for conditional effects by gender, identifying as a student of color, the number of adversities experienced prior to college, and HAA Scholarship application year as a proxy for year of initial college entry. Conclusions/Recommendations: The study's main findings include: having a mentor while in college as well as during high school had a positive influence on college coping; self-efficacy significantly and positively influenced all three dimensions of coping with the college environment; and several relationships differed between females (vs. males) and first-year (vs. other) students. Overall, the study responds to calls for additional research in this arena, builds on the literature on college coping, readiness and success, and extends previous validation research on dimensions of coping with college through analysis of a robust sample of college students.

Assembling a Career: Labor Market Outcomes for Manufacturing Program Students in Two-Year Technical Colleges,"Matheny, Christopher J.; Chan, Hsun-yu; Wang, Xueli","Objective: Research on labor market outcomes for individuals who enroll in technical colleges is limited, with even less attention to the effects of short-term certificates than associate degrees. Also, despite the importance of manufacturing programs, there is a lack of research on employment outcomes for individuals who enroll in these programs at technical colleges. In this study, we explored how types of credential earned are related to employment outcomes 4 years post-enrollment for students in manufacturing programs at public 2-year technical colleges in Wisconsin. Method: We drew upon administrative and wage data on over 6,000 first-time students matriculating into manufacturing-related programs at Wisconsin's technical colleges between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression, we investigated the association between types of credentials earned and labor market outcomes while controlling for the sample's sociodemographic background and academic experiences. Results: Our analyses revealed that students, particularly males, who completed an associate degree or a 2-year technical diploma were at an advantage in both rates of employment and earnings. White male students also enjoyed a stronger likelihood of being employed and earned higher annual wages than their ethnic minority counterparts. These advantages were not as manifest among female students. Contributions: Our study indicates that, to advance the employment prospects of technical college students, it is critical to expand institutional efforts to support longer term credential attainment. Our findings did not support the popular ""jobbing-out"" myth lingering in manufacturing education at the 2-year college level.",2015,,Community College Review,43,4,380-406,1773222689; EJ1073995,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091552115597999,,#322,Matheny 2015,"",""

Socioeconomic disadvantage confers risk for less adaptive learning-related behaviors at school entry, yet substantial variability in school readiness exists within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Investigation of neurophysiological systems associated with learning-related behaviors in high-risk populations could illuminate resilience processes. This study examined the relevance of a neurophysiological measure of controlled attention allocation, amplitude of the P3b event-related potential, for learning-related behaviors and academic performance in a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged kindergarteners. The sample consisted of 239 children from an urban, low-income community, approximately half of whom exhibited behavior problems at school entry (45% aggressive/oppositional; 64% male; 69% African American, 21% Hispanic). Results revealed that higher P3b amplitudes to target stimuli in a go/no-go task were associated with more adaptive learning-related behaviors in kindergarten. Furthermore, children's learning-related behaviors in kindergarten mediated a positive indirect effect of P3b amplitude on growth in academic performance from kindergarten to 1st grade. Given that P3b amplitude reflects attention allocation processes, these findings build on the scientific justification for interventions targeting young children's attention skills in order to promote effective learning-related behaviors and academic achievement within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.",2015,,Developmental Psychology,51,8,1148-1162,1720066375; EJ1069941,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0039311,,#328,Willner 2015,"",""

The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method: The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively.

One of the main results is that, in general, there is a negative association between the probability of a household being poor and the education level of the household heads. It has also been found that the poverty risk of those households whose heads graduated from a vocational or technical high school is less than those who graduated from high school.

Only 22% of the 25% who do not access PSE (or 5.5% of all youths in our sample) claim that ""finances"" constitute a barrier. Further analysis suggests that affordability ""per se"" is an issue in only a minority of those cases where finances are cited, suggesting that the real problem for the majority of those reporting financial barriers may be that they do not perceive PSE to be of sufficient value to be worth pursuing: ""it costs too much"" may mean ""it is not worth it"" rather than ""I cannot afford to go.""

A transparent hiring process and salary schedule have reduced the gender wage gap to 1% at Riverside City College, compared to the 6-14% reported national average among faculty in higher education. Even though the gender wage gap is small, gender discrimination and gender bias are evident when the number of women in positions of authority is examined. Another indicator of gender inequity at Riverside City College is the high percentage of men teaching in STEM disciplines compared to women teaching in those disciplines.",2015,,Forum on Public Policy Online,2015,1,1-9,1773224318; EJ1080941,,,#343,Brown 2015,"",""

Eliminating Educational Inequality through E-Learning: The Case of Virtual University of Pakistan,"Din, Aisha Muhammad; Jabeen, Sadia","This study aims at examining the role of e-learning in combating the issues of inequality in terms of access and quality in the field of higher education in Pakistan. The education system in Pakistan is mainly characterized by educational disparity. The standard of education is directly proportional to the investment students make in the form of registration and fees. Another important issue is the non-availability of reputed educational institutes in small towns and villages. Unfortunately, very few people from rural areas have access to quality higher education. Virtual University of Pakistan through its distance e-learning mode has come forward to break this trend in social inequality by providing equal educational opportunities to all social classes through its affordable fee structure yet ensuring high standards of teaching. For the purpose of testing these assumptions with reference to a Virtual education system, the existing patterns of enrollment, income structure of guardian/students, professors' profile, and alumni's profile data were obtained from IT department of Virtual University of Pakistan. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test were used for data analysis. It could be ascertained from the conclusion that Virtual University of Pakistan has successfully broken the chain of educational inequality through its e-learning mode. In case of virtual education, discrimination on the basis of gender, social class and location, is no more applicable.

How Consistent Are Course Grades? An Examination of Differential Grading,"Rauschenberg, Samuel","Differential grading occurs when students in courses with the same content and curriculum receive inconsistent grades across teachers, schools, or districts. It may be due to many factors, including differences in teacher grading standards, district grading policies, student behavior, teacher stereotypes, teacher quality, and curriculum adherence. If it occurs systematically, certain types of students may receive higher or lower grades relative to other students, despite having similar content mastery or ability. Using three years of statewide data on Algebra I and English I courses in North Carolina public high schools, I find that student characteristics are stronger predictors of differential grading than teacher, school, or district characteristics. Female, Limited English Proficient, and 12th grade students earn statistically significant higher grades than other students, holding test scores and student, teacher, school, and district characteristics constant. Low-income students, conversely, earn lower grades than other students, all else constant. With the exception of Algebra I low-income students, these differences are large enough to move a student one grade category on a plus/minus 7-point A-F grading scale. Black students earn higher Algebra I grades but lower English I grades than white or Asian students with the same test score, but these effect sizes are smaller than other student characteristics.

Quality of evidence revealing subtle gender biases in science is in the eye of the beholder,"Handley, IM; Brown, ER; Moss-Racusin, CA; Smith, JL","Scientists are trained to evaluate and interpret evidence without bias or subjectivity. Thus, growing evidence revealing a gender bias against women-or favoring men-within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) settings is provocative and raises questions about the extent to which gender bias may contribute to women's underrepresentation within STEM fields. To the extent that research illustrating gender bias in STEM is viewed as convincing, the culture of science can begin to address the bias. However, are men and women equally receptive to this type of experimental evidence? This question was tested with three randomized, double-blind experiments-two involving samples from the general public (n = 205 and 303, respectively) and one involving a sample of university STEM and non-STEM faculty (n = 205). In all experiments, participants read an actual journal abstract reporting gender bias in a STEM context (or an altered abstract reporting no gender bias in experiment 3) and evaluated the overall quality of the research. Results across experiments showed that men evaluate the gender-bias research less favorably than women, and, of concern, this gender difference was especially prominent among STEM faculty (experiment 2). These results suggest a relative reluctance among men, especially faculty men within STEM, to accept evidence of gender biases in STEM.

Early career gender wage gaps among university graduates in Russia,"Rudakov, V; Kiryushina, M; Figueiredo, H; Teixeira, PN","Purpose The aim of the research is to estimate the level of the early career gender wage gap in Russia, its evolution during the early stages of a career, gender segregation and discrimination among university graduates, and to identify factors which explain early career gender differences in pay. Special emphasis is placed on assessing the contribution of horizontal segregation (inequal gender distribution in fields of studies and industries of employment) to early-career gender inequality. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a comprehensive and nationally representative survey of university graduates, carried out by Russian Federal State Statistics Service in 2016 (VTR Rosstat). The authors use Mincer OLS regressions for the analysis of the determinants of gender differences in pay. To explain the factors which form the gender gap, the authors use the Oaxaca-Blinder and Neumark gender gap decompositions, including detailed wage gap decompositions and decompositions by fields of study. For the analysis of differences in gender gap across wage distribution, quantile regressions and quantile decompositions based on recentered influence functions (RIFs) are used. Findings The study found significant gender differences in the early-career salaries of university graduates. Regression analysis confirms the presence of a 20% early-career gender wage gap. This gender wage gap is to a great extent can be explained by horizontal segregation: women are concentrated in fields of study and industries which are relatively low paid. More than half of the gender gap remains unexplained. The analysis of the evolution of the gender wage gap shows that it appears right after graduation and increases over time. A quantile decomposition reveals that, in low paid jobs, females experience less gender inequality than in better paid jobs. Social implications The analysis has some important policy implications. Previously, gender equality policies were mainly related to the elimination of gender discrimination at work, including positive discrimination programs in a selection of candidates to job openings and programs of promotion; programs which ease women labour force participation through flexible jobs; programs of human capital accumulation, which implied gender equality in access to higher education and encouraged women to get higher education, which was especially relevant for many developing countries. The analysis of Russia, a country with gender equality in access to higher education, shows that the early career gender gap exists right after graduation, and the main explanatory factor is gender segregation by field of study and industry, in other words, the gender wage gap to a high extent is related to self-selection of women in low-paid fields of study. To address this, new policies related to gender inequality in choice of fields of studies are needed. Originality/value It has been frequently stated that gender inequality appears either due to inequality in access to higher education or after maternity leave. Using large nationally representative dataset on university graduates, we show that gender equality in education does not necessarily lead to gender equality in the labour market. Unlike many studies, we show that the gender gap in Russia appears not after maternity leave and due to marital decisions of women, but in the earliest stages of their career, right after graduation, due to horizontal segregation (selection of women in relatively low-paid fields of study and consequently industries).",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER,44,6,1046-1070,WOS:000800293400001,10.1108/IJM-03-2021-0206,,#368,Rudakov 2023,"",""
The gender gap in K-12 educator salaries,"Fox, D; Gmeiner, M; Price, J","We examine gender gaps in the salaries of K-12 educators. This is an occupation where direct gender discrimination is less likely since salaries are determined by a union pay scale and women constitute the majority of employers. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we find a gender gap of $12,000 in the personal income of K-12 educators, with only part of this gap stemming from gender differences in administrative positions, graduate degrees, and grades taught. In contrast, when we use a dataset of the public salaries of K-12 educators, we find a raw gender gap that is about three times smaller. When we directly compare the distribution of annual income for male and female educators between the public salary and ACS data, we find that an important part of the gender gap stems from male educators having additional income outside of their primary teaching salary.",2019,,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,68,,23-26,WOS:000458467800003,10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.11.004,,#369,Fox 2019,"",""
Addressing Unintended Consequences of Gender Diversity Interventions on Women's Sense of Belonging in STEM,"Pietri, ES; Hennes, EP; Dovidio, JF; Brescoll, VL; Bailey, AH; Moss-Racusin, CA; Handelsman, J","Validated interventions that increase bias literacy (i.e., knowledge of gender bias) and decrease sexism are critical to addressing pervasive gender biases in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, interventions that highlight existing gender inequities may inadvertently act as a social identity threat cue for women. Including identity-safe cues in diversity interventions (i.e., suggesting that women are valued in STEM) may lessen these problematic outcomes. To explore this possibility, we conducted three experiments utilizing Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM (VIDS), a validated diversity intervention relying on high quality videos to convey the existence of gender bias in STEM. Consistent with prior research, relative to control conditions, VIDS led to greater bias literacy and lower gender bias among both men and women (Experiments 1 and 2) and encouraged women's intentions to take collective action (Experiment 2). At the same time, compared to control conditions, VIDS resulted in lower sense of belonging in the sciences, greater negative affect, and greater self-reported social identity threat, both among women from the general U.S. population (Experiments 1 and 2) and female scientists (Experiment 3). Including identity-safe cues, which present a positive female scientist role model (Experiment 2) or suggest that gender bias can be overcome (Experiments 2 and 3), helped alleviate VIDS' harmful effects on women's belonging and trust in the sciences, but had limited impact on stereotype threat. These findings highlight the need for researchers and practitioners to examine potential unintended negative consequences of diversity interventions and investigate techniques to buffer such outcomes.",2019,,SEX ROLES,80,9-10,527-547,WOS:000464719000002,10.1007/s11199-018-0952-2,,#372,Pietri 2019,"",""
The gender wage gap in highly prestigious occupations: a case study of Swedish medical doctors,"Magnusson, C","The gender wage gap within a highly prestigious occupation, the medical profession, is investigated both longitudinally and cross-sectionally using Swedish administrative data. This is done by investigating: to what extent the gender wage gap among physicians varies between fields of medicine (within-occupation segregation) and across family status; whether there is an association between parenthood and wages among physicians and, if so, whether there is a gender difference in this association; and changes in the gender wage gap among physicians over time. The results indicate a large overall gender wage difference for medical doctors. Even when gender differences in specialization are taken into account, men have higher wages than women do. For both men and women physicians, there is a positive association between parenthood and wages.

We aimed to describe: (1) the recent gender-equity climate according to women and men faculty in the department of pediatrics at a single, large academic center, and (2) institutional efforts to address persistent gender discrimination and harassment. In late 2020, we distributed an anonymous survey to all department faculty that included demographic data, a modified version of the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work Scale, questions about experiences/witnessed discriminatory treatment and sexual harassment, and if those experiences negatively affected career advancement.

Inequities Faced by Female Doctors Serving Communities of Need,"Motta-Moss, A; Hussain, Z","The reasons for sex inequity in medicine are complex and partly interface ethnic background, specialty choice, and practice location.

Data from 1524 CSOM graduates show an increase in the number of women and underrepresented groups, with about a quarter of them working in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). When compared with their male counterparts, our female graduates report lower income for similar work hours, with this disparity increasing slightly between female and male doctors working in HPSAs. In addition, our female graduates have chosen primary care specialties at a ratio of nearly 2:1 when compared with their male peers. Despite these inequities, our female graduates report satisfaction with their career choices, primarily due to a strong commitment to serving back patients in those communities where some of them come from.

This database consists of a linkage between the American Association of Medical Colleges faculty roster and a physician database from Doximity, and includes physician age, sex, years since residency completion, publications, National Institutes of Health grants, and registered clinical trials for all academic physicians by specialty. We used multivariable logistic regression models with medical school-specific fixed effects to assess sex differences in full professorship by specialty and the relationship between these factors and achieving the rank of full professor within ID. We compared this adjusted difference in ID to that of peer subspecialties.Results: Among a total of 2016 academic ID physicians, there were 742 (37%) women who together accounted for 48.1% of assistant professors, 39.7% of associate professors, and 19.2% of full professors.

Past studies on educational aspiration have mostly focused on the role of individual factors and the immediate context but have neglected the role of the broader societal environment. The current study examined (1) how gender inequality shaped adolescents' long-term educational aspiration and (2) whether gender inequality affected boys and girls differently. We used the longitudinal data of the China Family Panel Studies (2010-2014), which included a sample of 3,464 adolescents from 25 provinces in China (49.5% girls; M-age = 12.56, SD = 1.74). Multilevel analyses showed that adolescents in provinces with higher levels of gender inequality reported lower educational aspiration four years later. This association remained significant after adjusting for baseline educational aspiration and multiple provincial and sociodemographic covariates. The effects of gender inequality did not differ between boys and girls, suggesting that gender inequality was detrimental for both boys' and girls' long-term educational aspiration. The current study highlights the important role of gender inequality in education and underscores the importance of looking beyond individual factors and the proximal context in understanding adolescents' educational aspiration. Our findings suggest the importance of reducing socio-structural gender biases and institutional impediments (e.g., expectations to perform gendered role, women's underrepresentation) which constrain both girls' and boys' educational aspiration and development.",2022,,SEX ROLES,86,5-6,320-333,WOS:000750430900001,10.1007/s11199-021-01272-z,,#379,Chen 2022,"",""

This analysis is based on a dataset of more than 1000 doctors working in five hospitals in the Lombardy region. Data were collected through an online survey with a response rate of 48.7 per cent. Women's concentration in the lower ranks of the career ladder, their lower propensity to work as private practitioners and their lower concentration in surgical specialties contribute to the gender income gap. Having children and a spouse or a cohabiting partner entails a premium on income for men, but no penalty for women, which suggests that positive discrimination towards fathers and husbands is stronger than negative discrimination towards mothers and wives. On the other hand, the gender gap associated with marital and parental status is stronger in public hospitals than in private hospitals, at least up to the second child.

Whether there are sex-based differences in surgical referrals is unknown.OBJECTIVE To examine whether physicians' referrals to surgeons are influenced by the sex of the referring physician and/or surgeon.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional, population-based study used administrative databases to identify outpatient referrals to surgeons in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2016, with follow-up to December 31, 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 7, 2019, to May 14, 2021.EXPOSURES Referring physician sex.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This study compared the proportion of referrals (overall and those referrals that led to surgery) made by male and female physicians to male and female surgeons to assess associations between surgeon, referring physician, or patient characteristics and referral decisions. Discrete choice modeling was used to examine the extent to which sex differences in referrals were associated with physicians' preferences for same-sex surgeons.RESULTS A total of 39 710 784 referrals were made by 44 893 physicians (27 792 [61.9%] male) to 5660 surgeons (4389 [77.5%] male). Female patients made up a greater proportion of referrals to female surgeons than to male surgeons (76.8% vs 55.3%, P < .001). Male surgeons accounted for 77.5% of all surgeons but received 87.1% of referrals from male physicians and 79.3% of referrals from female physicians. Female surgeons less commonly received procedural referrals than male surgeons (25.4% vs 33.0%, P < .001). After adjusting for patient and referring physician characteristics, male physicians referred a greater proportion of patients to male surgeons than did female physicians; differences were greatest among referrals from other surgeons (rate ratio, 1.14; 95% Ci, 1.13-1.16). Female physicians had a 1.6% (95% CI, 1.4%1.9%) greater odds of same-sex referrals, whereas male physicians had a 32.0% (95% CI, 31.8%-32.2%) greater odds of same-sex referrals; differences did not attenuate over time.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional, population-based study, male physicians appeared to have referral preferences for male surgeons; this disparity is not narrowing over time or as more women enter surgery. Such preferences lead to lower volumes of and fewer operative referrals to female surgeons and are associated with sex-based inequities in medicine.",2022,,JAMA SURGERY,157,2,95-103,WOS:000717728100001,10.1001/jamasurg.2021.5784,,#396,Dossa 2022,"",""

Does women's higher education reduce wage inequality? Evidence from Palestine using repeated cross-sectional data,"Morar, N; Awawda, S","Despite the increase of the share of highly-educated women, gender wage gap remains an ongoing issue in developing countries. The increase in women's education would provide them with more job opportunities resulting in higher employment rate amongst women and, thus, lower gender pay gap. In Palestine, the share of women with high education is 62% while their labor force participation rate is only 18%. This paper examines the effects of gender higher education on wage inequality in the Palestinian context. The study applied the Mincer equation to study the determinants of wage, while the decomposed Gini coefficient is used to measure the contribution of education and other factors to overall wage inequality. The study used data from the labor force survey (LFS) which is conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) covering the period from 2010 to 2020. Results show that those with higher education have relatively higher wages as compared to those with only high education or with school education. Results also show that gender wage inequality has increased during the study period (2010-2020), but the contribution of both gender and education differences to the overall wage inequality has decreased. In general, the gender pay gap remains a crucial issue in the Palestinian context with a persisting decreasing pay gap over time across all education levels. Policymakers shall orient efforts towards investing in women's education, thus increasing their empowerment in the labor market, which in turn would improve the level of development and economic growth in the country.",2024,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,11,1,,WOS:001304507700002,10.1057/s41599-024-03620-2,,#399,Morar 2024,"",""

An international survey on gender-related differences was performed among young gynecologic oncology surgeons in Europe to identify potential gender inequalities in career development. Material and methodsA survey on demographics, clinical and academic working environment, family/parenting, career development, salary and leadership was sent to all members of the European Network of Young Gynecologic Oncologists (ENYGO), which is a network within the European Society of Gynecologic Oncology (ESGO). Gynecologic oncology surgeons and obstetricians/gynecologists who actively work in this field in Europe were included in the study. ResultsResponses were analyzed from 192 gynecologic oncology surgeons of whom 65.1% (125/192) were female (median age 37, IQR: 34 - 42) and 34.9% (67/192) were male (median age 38, IQR: 36 - 41). Male reported to perform a median of 15 and female a median of 10 operations per month (p = .007). Among female, 24.8% had a leadership position vs. 44.8% among male, crude OR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.31-4.62, p<.01. When stratifying for age under 41 and having children, 36.7% of male and 5.6% of female had a leadership position, adjusted OR 10.8, 95% CI 3.28-35.64, p<.001. A significantly higher proportion of female compared to male believed they earned less than their gender counterparts at the same clinical position and with same qualifications (30.4% vs. 2.5%, p<.001). There was not a statistically significant gender difference in the academic qualification PhD degree or professorship (p = .92 and p = .64, respectively). In the previous year, male published more peer-reviewed articles than female (median 3 vs. median 2; p = .017). ConclusionThis first comprehensive survey on gender-differences in gynecologic oncology in Europe revealed that there are gender gaps concerning several aspects during the critical time of career development in the young generation of gynecologic oncology surgeons.

Glass ceilings in research: Evidence from a national program in Uruguay,"Bukstein, D; Gandelman, N","Female researchers have lower probability than male researchers of being accepted into the largest national research support program in Uruguay. Age, scientific productivity, teaching activities and previous applications explains 5.2 percentage points of the 7.1 point gender acceptance probability gap. The remaining 1.9% can be attributed to gender discrimination. This phenomenon is stronger at the top 2 levels (out of 4) of the program evidencing glass ceilings. Results are robust to issues of simultaneity (research productivity affecting probability of being accepted and vice versa), joint determination and correlation of variables and productivity effects at early stages of career development. The paper tests four hypotheses that are likely to produce a glass ceiling in any R&D incentive schemes: male overrepresentation in the initial setup of the program, male overrepresentation on evaluation committees and two types of field-level effects (a pure composition effect without discrimination and differentiated discriminatory effects by fields). We show evidence of gender bias in the initial setup of the program and bias in the gender structure of committees. Nevertheless, these hypotheses have little quantitative power to explain the glass ceiling. The pure field composition effect is also not important. We find solid evidence of glass ceilings in the three areas where women are most active: health-related sciences, natural sciences and humanities. On the other hand, we find no such effects in social sciences, agricultural sciences or engineering.",2019,,RESEARCH POLICY,48,6,1550-1563,WOS:000466619400018,10.1016/j.respol.2019.03.007,,#403,Bukstein 2019,"",""
Mobility as a service and gender: A review with a view,"McIlroy, RC","The extent to which MaaS might contribute to gender equity in transport has been considered by some; however, the level of attention paid to the topic varies enormously, and there is significant variation in the data regarding how perceptions and use (or intended use) of MaaS systems might differ between men and women.

Gender Imbalance in Authorship of Veterinary Literature: 1995 versus 2015,"Giuffrida, MA; Burton, JH; Dechant, JE; Winter, A","Despite increasing representation of women in veterinary medicine, gender differences persist in pay and attainment of senior and leadership positions. In academia, scholarly publication is a measure of productivity and is emphasized in the promotion process. This study aimed to analyze gender differences in the authorship of veterinary research articles to understand factors that could influence women's advancement and standing in academic medicine. We hypothesized that the proportion of women authors would increase between 1995 and 2015 and be similar to employment rates of women in academia, and that gender differences would exist in authorship by species, veterinary specialty area, and role (junior versus senior author). We examined 2,086 articles published in eight prominent veterinary journals in 1995 and 2015, determined the gender of first authors, corresponding authors, and senior authors, and collected article information including study design, species, and veterinary specialty area. The proportion of women as first and corresponding author increased significantly between 1995 and 2015, and in both years studied, women authored a larger percentage of articles than the reported percentage of women working in academia. In 2015, women were first authors of 60.0% (95% CI 56.9-63.0) of articles but accounted for only 38.3% of senior authors (95% CI 33.4-43.3).

The results indicated that although college students were aware of the existence of occupational segregation and the gender pay gap, they were unaware of the magnitude of occupational segregation by gender and substantially underestimated the size of the gender pay gap. Over a 16-year period this low awareness of gender issues in the workplace remained remarkably consistent, which could contribute to complacency about the gender pay gap and thereby maintain the status quo.

Gender Inequality in STEM Employment and Earnings at Career Entry: Evidence from Millennial Birth Cohorts,"VanHeuvelen, T; Quadlin, N","Although science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors remain male dominated, women's greater enrollment in STEM is one of the greatest transformations to occur in U.S. higher education in the past half century. But to what extent have women's gains in STEM enrollment translated to greater parity in labor market outcomes? Although the challenges women face in STEM have been well documented, questions about the influence of gender for STEM employment and earnings differences remain. In the present research, the authors use data from recent birth cohorts in the American Community Survey between 2009 and 2018 (starting with the first year college majors were available in the survey) and a reweighting technique from labor economics to track the evolution of gender inequalities in STEM employment and earnings inequality among STEM work at the onset of labor market entry. Even among a sample expected to produce highly conservative gender differences, sizable gender inequalities in STEM employment are observed. The authors show that despite women's gains in STEM education among recent cohorts, women with STEM degrees face employment prospects in STEM work that more closely resemble those of men without STEM degrees than men with STEM degrees. Moreover, although modest gender earnings gaps eventually emerge for those without STEM degrees, large gaps occur at the outset of employment for STEM workers. Thus, although STEM education provides important opportunities for women's earning potential, it may be less effective in itself to address significant gender inequalities among STEM employment.",2021,,SOCIUS,7,,,WOS:000938150200097,10.1177/23780231211064392,,#407,VanHeuvelen 2021,"",""

Is the quality of female auditors really better? Evidence based on the Chinese A-share market,"Yang, SX; Liu, YG; Mai, QD","Unlike previous studies in which a single index was used to measure audit quality, this study establishes a new comprehensive index to measure audit quality via Discretionary Accrual, as estimated by Jones' basic model (1991) and Audit Opinions. The former is used to measure the quality of financial statements, and the latter is used to measure the auditors' independence in the mainstream international literature. We examine whether and how an auditor's gender affects the quality of his or her audits under the framework of empathy theory and gender role socialization theory. Using a large sample of 9861 auditor-firm-year observations from Chinese A-share-listed companies from 2011 to 2015, we find that the audit quality of signed auditors shows significant gender differences: these significant gender differences differ from the findings of previous studies that female auditors could provide a higher-quality audit than male auditors; that is, in our study the audit quality of the male auditors exceeds that of the female auditors. After distinguishing the positive and negative directions of the Discretionary Accrual, we find no significant gender differences in audit quality between male and female auditors when the earnings had been adjusted upward by the client; that is, female and male auditors had the same audit risk perception. However, when the client adjusted earnings downward, which indicates a lower audit risk for the auditor, the audit quality of female auditors was significantly lower than that of the male auditors. After controlling for the age and position of the auditors, we also find that the gender differences in the auditors' audit quality decreased significantly or even disappeared when the auditor's age exceeded 45 years and/or their position was manager or above. These results are consistent with the empathy theory and gender role socialization theory. (C) 208 Sun Yat-sen University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Methods:The survey was proposed via QR code during the 43rd National Congress of the Italian League Against Epilepsy (Padua, 8-10 June 2022), and subsequently distributed via email until 7th September 2022. Results:Of the respondents, 73.6% were female. Of note, 51% of the entire sample answered that they found ""no impact"" of gender on educational activities (64.3% male against 46.1% female). Only 10% of women stated they have seen very much gender-related inequality in their education or career. However, the majority of our cohort (66%) thought that gender had a negative impact on progression within a scientific society, as well as in female leadership roles in clinical practice (67.9%).

Comparative analysis of gender disparity in academic positions based on US region and STEM discipline,"Galvin, DJ; Anderson, SC; Marolf, CJ; Schneider, NG; Liebl, AL","Despite a move toward gender parity in the United States (U.S.) workforce, a large gender gap persists in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); this is particularly true for academic (i.e., instructor and tenure track) STEM positions. This gap increases as women advance through the traditional steps of academia, with the highest degree of gender disparity in tenured positions. As policies, politics, and culture, which all contribute to gender equity across the world, vary across regions in the United States, we expect that the gender gap in STEM might also vary across geographic regions. Here, we evaluated over 20,000 instructor and tenure track positions in university STEM departments across the U.S. to evaluate whether and how the geographic region of a university might determine its proportion of women in STEM academic positions. Similar to previous research, regardless of geographic region, more men were employed in both tenure track and instructor positions across STEM fields. However, variation existed regionally within the U.S., with the Mountain region employing the lowest proportion of women in tenure track positions and the East North Central and Pacific regions employing the greatest proportion. We expect this regional variation could be caused by differences in state and local policies, regional representation, and mentorship, resulting in inconsistent support for women, leading to differences in work environments, hiring, and job retention rates across the country. A better understanding of which geographic areas within the U.S. have more equal distributions of women in the STEM field will help us to identify the specific mechanisms that facilitate more equal and inclusive opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups across all levels of STEM academia.",2024,,PLOS ONE,19,3,,WOS:001190771400053,10.1371/journal.pone.0298736,,#425,Galvin 2024,"",""
Culture and the gender gap in choice of major: An analysis using sibling comparisons,"Aldén, L; Neuman, E","We study if there is an association between culture on gender roles and the gender gap in choice of major. For this purpose, we use the epidemiological approach and sibling comparisons. We find that the gender gap in STEM is smaller for individuals who originate in countries where women are more likely, relative to men, to major in STEM. We observe a similar pattern when we study the probability to major in a male- or female-dominated field. We present suggestive evidence that cultural beliefs explain our results. Thus, to limit gender segregation in education this study points to the importance of changing gendered beliefs about educational choices. However, the results indicate that the gender convergence in STEM and male-dominated fields is driven by the fact that men, not women, choose less gender-typical majors. This suggests that to increase women's participation in STEM and male-dominated fields, policies in other areas, e.g., directed towards changing workplace characteristics, may also be necessary.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Why Are There So Few Women Medical School Deans? Debunking the Myth That Shorter Tenures Drive Disparities,"Gottlieb, AS; Roy, B; Herrin, J; Holaday, LW; Weiss, J; Salazar, MC; Okoli, N; Nagarkatti, N; Otridge, J; Pomeroy, C","PurposeGender disparities among the senior echelons of academic medicine are striking and persistent. The role of medical school dean has been particularly immune to gender diversity, and limited prior research identified women's shorter decanal tenures as a potential driver. The authors assessed gender differences in tenure length of deanships in the current era to elucidate this finding.MethodFrom October 2020 to June 2021, the authors collected information about medical school deanships that were held from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2020. All schools were members of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The authors collected data from online public records and augmented their findings via direct outreach to medical schools. They used time-to-event analyses before and after adjustment for interim vs permanent status of the initial appointment, school ownership (public/private), and school size to assess for gender differences in length of deanship tenure during the study period. The unit of analysis was deanships, and the primary outcome was length of deanships measured in years.ResultsAuthors included data on 528 deanships. Women held 91 (17%) of these terms. Men held the majority of permanent deanships (n = 352 [85%]). A greater percentage of the deanships held by women were interim only (n = 27 [30%]) compared with men (n = 85 [20%]). In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no significant gender differences in length of deanship tenures.ConclusionsAnalysis of appointments of AAMC-member medical school deans from 2006 to 2020 revealed that women have remained in their deanships as long as their male counterparts. The myth about women deans' shorter longevity should no longer be promulgated. Academic medicine should consider novel solutions to addressing women's persistent underrepresentation in the dean role, including employing the gender proportionality principle used in the business and legal communities.",2024,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,99,1,63-69,WOS:001134819400005,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005315,,#428,Gottlieb 2024,"",""

Results from multinomial logistic regression show that women are more likely than men to become office clerks, a typically female-dominated occupation. Gender disparities in professional/technical occupations are largely attributed to women's underrepresentation in science and engineering fields. As to managerial/marketing occupations, after controlling for study field, gender disparity in attaining these jobs grows even larger. Innovatively constructing a hypothetical scenario, we further examined probable career outcomes if women were as likely as men to enter the specific study field. Our results suggest that, despite pervasive influence of gender norms, egalitarian gender attitudes at job entry can partially moderate women's disadvantage in entering male-dominated occupations. Holding traditional gender attitudes would increase women's chances of becoming office clerks.

Wage formation and gender wage gaps: is there a role for job-task evaluation schemes?,"Asplund, R; Lilja, R","Purpose - Both academia and policymakers express a strong belief in higher average education levels exerting a narrowing impact on wage inequality in general and gender wage gaps in particular. The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize whether or not this effect extends to R&D- and export-intensive branches such as the technology industry.Design/methodology/approach - In exploring the impact of individual and job-related background factors and, especially, of job-task evaluation schemes on the size and change in gender wage gaps in the technology industry, the paper applies an elaborated decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression techniques.Findings - While changes in standard human capital endowments can explain little, if anything, of the growth in real wages or the widening of wage dispersion among the Finnish technology industry's white-collar workers, a new job-task evaluation scheme introduced in 2002 seems to have succeeded, at least in part, to make the wage-setting process more transparent by re-allocating especially the technology industry's female white-collar workers in a way that better reflects their skills, efforts and responsibilities.Practical implications - One crucial implication of this finding is that improving the standard human capital of women closer to that of men will not suffice to narrow the gender wage gap in the advanced parts of the economy and, hence, not also the overall gender wage gap. The reason is obvious: concomitant with rising average education levels, other skill aspects have received increasing attention in working life. Consequently, a conscious combination of formal and informal competencies as laid down in well-designed job-task evaluation schemes may, in many instances, offer a more powerful path for tackling the gender wage gap.Originality/value - While the existing evidence on the impact of performance-related pay on gender wage gaps is still scarce but growing the authors know of no empirical studies analyzing the gender pay-gap effect of job-task evaluation systems.",2014,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER,35,3,267-290,WOS:000341870100004,10.1108/IJM-04-2014-0091,,#430,Asplund 2014,"",""

The Rise of Programming and the Stalled Gender Revolution,"Cheng, SW; Chauhan, B; Chintala, S","Despite remarkable progress toward gender equality over the past half-century, the stalled convergence in the gender wage gap after the mid-1990s remains a puzzle. This study provides new insights into this puzzle by conducting the first large-scale investigation of the uneven impact of the rise of programming in the labor market for men and women since the mid-1990s. We argue that the increasing reliance on programming has favored men's economic status relative to women's and therefore may help explain the slow convergence of the gender wage gap. We differentiate between two effects: (1) the composition effect, wherein men experience a greater employment growth in programming-intensive occupations relative to women, and (2) the price effect, wherein the wage returns to programming intensity increase more for men than women. Our empirical analysis documents a strong relationship between the rise of programming and the slow convergence of the gender wage gap among college graduates. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of the composition and price effects would have reduced the gender wage gap over the past two decades by an additional 14.70 percent.

In this article, we focus on one dimension that has been central to studies of inequality in higher education-college selectivity-to examine how young adult earnings are stratified among college graduates who majored in the same fields, using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS; N = 2,952). We also assess gender differences in the relationships between fields of study, college selectivity, and earnings, given that gender is a consistent predictor of both majors and earnings. After accounting for selection bias using propensity score matching techniques, we find that recent college graduates in only two majors-business and the social sciences-experience a selectivity premium. Additionally, we find key gender differences in the majors that give rise to these premiums. Both men and women experience a selectivity premium in business and the social sciences, but within STEM fields, men benefit from a prestigious degree, but women do not. This finding underscores recent research showing that high-performing men in STEM fields receive outsized rewards relative to their women counterparts, thus deepening gender inequality in fields where women are underrepresented and assigned low expectations for performance.",2021,,RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY,75,,,WOS:000703669800002,10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100647,,#434,Quadlin 2021,"",""

Association of Physician Characteristics With Perceptions and Experiences of Gender Equity in an Academic Internal Medicine Department,"Ruzycki, SM; Freeman, G; Bharwani, A; Brown, A","IMPORTANCE The persistence of inequities that disadvantage women physicians remains empirically underexplained. Understanding the cultural factors that are associated with disparities in harassment, discrimination, remuneration, and career trajectory are critical to addressing inequities.OBJECTIVES To explore how physicians perceive the climate for women physicians and compare perceptions and experiences of gender inequity among physicians based on characteristics including gender, faculty status, parental status, and years in practice.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This sequential, explanatory, mixed-methods qualitative study used the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS; range 45-225, with higher scores indicating better perceived culture toward women), followed by individual semistructured interviews with physicians at the Department of Medicine of the University of Calgary. All 389 physician members of the Department of Medicine, including academic and clinical physicians and those of any gender, were invited to participate in the survey and interview phases.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The culture within the department for women physicians was assessed using the CCWAS score. Scores were compared between respondents' gender and years in practice. Interviews with physicians were used to further explore findings from the CCWAS and to understand experiences and perceptions of gender disparities.RESULTS A total of 169 of 389 physicians completed the survey (response rate, 43.4%; 102 [59.9%] women; 65 [38.9%] men; and 2 [1.2%] who did not disclose gender); 28 participants (7.2%) elected to participate in an interview (22 [78.6%] women; 6 [21.4%] men). Women physicians perceived the culture of the department toward women as significantly worse than men physicians (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 137.0 [118.0-155.0] vs 164.5 [154.0-183.4]; P < .001). Physicians with more than 15 years in practice perceived the culture toward women as significantly more favorable than physicians with 15 years or less in practice (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 157.0 [138.8-181.3] vs 147.0 [127.5-164.3]; P = .02). Qualitative data demonstrated that experiences of junior women (ie, physicians who graduated medical school after 1996, when an equal number of men and women in medical school was achieved in Canada) and perceptions of senior men (ie, those who graduated before 1996) were most different; junior women reported high rates of discrimination and harassment, while senior men perceived that the Department of Medicine had achieved gender equity.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, senior men physicians' perceptions of gender equity were different from lived experiences of gender inequity reported by junior women physicians.

However, relative to other women, having a career signalling degree (i.e. economics, law or engineering) from a more prestigious university helps women. Dividing the sample into different cohorts indicates that the gender gap is partly a cohort effect, i.e. it is smaller among those born in the 1960s compared to cohorts born in the 1940s and 1950s.

Advancing Women's Health and Women's Leadership With Endowed Chairs in Women's Health,"Carnes, M; Johnson, P; Klein, W; Jenkins, M; Merz, CNB","Gender-based bias and conflation of gender and status are root causes of disparities in women's health care and the slow advancement of women to leadership in academic medicine. More than a quarter of women physicians train in internal medicine and its subspecialties, and women physicians almost exclusively constitute the women's health focus within internal medicine. Thus, internal medicine has considerable opportunity to develop women leaders in academic medicine and promote women's health equity.To probe whether holding an endowed chair-which confers status-in women's health may be an effective way to advance women leaders in academic medicine and women's health, the authors explored the current status of endowed chairs in women's health in internal medicine. They found that the number of these endowed chairs in North America increased from 7 in 2013 to 19 in 2015, and all were held by women.

For the five waves considered, we confirm the very strong negative association between female presence in a subject or occupation and wages.

Gender composition and wage gaps in the Canadian health policy research workforce in comparative perspective,"Gupta, N; Balcom, SA; Singh, P","Background Gendered challenges have been shown to persist among health practitioners in countries at all levels of development. Less is known about non-clinical professionals, that is, those who do not deliver services directly but are essential to health systems performance, such as health policy researchers. This national observational study examined gender occupational segregation and wage gaps in the Canadian health policy research workforce using a cross-domain comparative labour market analysis approach. Methods Sourcing data from the 2016 population census, we applied linear regression and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition techniques to assess wage differentials by sex, traditional human capital measures (e.g., age, education, place of work), and social identity variables intersecting with gender (household head, childcare, migrant status) among health policy researchers aged 25-54. We compared the gender composition and wage gap with seven non-health policy and programme domains, as mapped under the national occupational classification by similarity in the types of work performed. Results The health policy research workforce (N = 19 955) was characterized by gender segregation: 74% women, compared with 58% women among non-health policy research occupations (N = 102 555). Women health policy researchers earned on average 4.8% (95% CI 1.5-8.0%) less than men after adjusting for other professional and personal variables. This gap was wider than among education policy researchers with similar gender composition (75% women; adjusted wage gap of 2.6%). Wages among health policy researchers were 21.1% (95% CI 19.4-22.8%) lower than their counterparts in the male-dominated economics policy domain, all else being equal. Overall, women's earnings averaged 3.2% lower than men's due to factors that remained unexplained by policy domain or other measured predictors. Conclusions This investigation found that the gender inequalities already widely seen among clinical practitioners are replicated among health policy researchers, potentially hindering the competitiveness of the health sector for attracting and retaining talent. Our findings suggest intersectoral actions are necessary to tackle wage gaps and devaluation of female-dominated health professions.

Disparity in Medicare Reimbursement Between Female and Male Vitreoretinal Surgeons,"Gilson, AS; Adelman, RA","Purpose: To quantify the Medicare reimbursement disparity between female and male vitreoretinal surgeons. Methods: Reimbursement reports were obtained from the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2013 through 2020, which detail all Medicare Part B services. A vitreoretinal surgeon was defined as any provider with at least 10 charges of a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code related to vitrectomy or retinal detachment repair. Providers were grouped by sex, and the average total reimbursement rate and additional secondary statistics to quantify the reimbursement disparity were identified. Results: On average, female vitreoretinal surgeons were reimbursed 65% that of their male counterparts in 2020, $1.66 million to $2.56 million. The percentage of the average male vitreoretinal specialist's total reimbursement that the average female vitreoretinal specialist received decreased 8.8% from 2013 to 2020, from 73.8% to 65.0%. Conclusions: The reimbursement that the average female vitreoretinal surgeon receives from Medicare is only two thirds that of the average male vitreoretinal surgeon. In addition, there was no identifiable improvement in this disparity over the study period. Further efforts must be taken to establish concerted efforts to improve the reimbursement disparity and to identify the systematic inequities that led to its presence in the first place.",2024,,JOURNAL OF VITREORETINAL DISEASES,8,3,286-292,WOS:001226268800014,10.1177/24741264231215532,,#450,Gilson 2024,"",""

This study explores the extent of these disparities in Canadian academic internal medicine, particularly in academic ranks, leadership positions, and research productivity.DesignCross-sectional.SubjectsFaculty physicians within internal medicine and subspecialties.Main MeasuresData on faculty physicians with Medical Doctorate (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), or Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees were compiled from 17 internal medicine programs listed in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). Research metrics were obtained using Elsevier's Scopus, and analyses were performed with Stata v14.2.Key ResultsAmong 5099 physician faculty members in internal medicine, 34% were women, and 66% were men. Among the faculty members holding leadership positions, 68% were men, and 32% were women. There was a significant difference in h-index between men and women physician faculty members (p <= 0.001), with men having a higher research output. Across all academic ranks, men faculty had higher median h-index values: Assistant Professor (12 vs. 9), Associate Professor (20 vs. 16), and Professor (40 vs. 30). Women were underrepresented in the procedural specialties, while only a few internal medicine subspecialties, such as palliative medicine and geriatrics, had a women predominance.ConclusionsOur study underscores existing gender disparity within academic internal medicine in Canada, aligning with global trends.

"Women's leadership in neuropsychology: historical perspectives, present trends, and future directions","Sachs, BC; Benitez, A; Buelow, MT; Gooding, A; Schaefer, LA; Sim, AH; Tussey, CM; Shear, PK","Objective: Although psychology has become a female-dominated field, this pattern of gender representation has not held true within the specialty of neuropsychology. In recent years more women have been pursuing careers in neuropsychology, and while the balance of male and female neuropsychologists as a whole has shifted, it is unclear whether the gender composition of leadership has also changed. Our goal was to survey various neuropsychological organizations, training programs, editorial boards, and organizations granting board certification to determine the current gender composition of leadership positions within neuropsychology. Method: A literature review was conducted to examine past trends of gender composition in neuropsychology, psychology, medicine, and academia. Data on current gender compositions of the field were culled from publicly available websites and through personal communication with representatives from major psychological and neuropsychological organizations. Results: We found that the overall composition of the field has changed over time, but notable gender disparities in leadership positions remain. Women still comprise the minority of leadership positions within most neuropsychological organizations, editorial boards for neuropsychology journals, and fellow positions in major neuropsychological organizations. More equitable representation has been achieved in the directorships of training programs and ABPP/ABCN board certification. Conclusion: We review the historical trends in gender discrepancies in leadership in neuropsychology and discuss these within the broader arenas of academia, research, and medicine. We conclude with a summary addressing potential causes for these discrepancies, including work-life balance issues, discrimination, institutional bias, and various other factors.

Association Between Gender and Salary Among Pediatric Hospital Medicine Physicians,"Forster, CS; Polak, CA; Chen, C; Kim, JL; Allan, JM; Gold, JM; Ruch-Ross, HS; Fromme, HB; Huang, B; Schondelmeyer, AC","Objectives: Gender-based disparities in salary exist in multiple fields of medicine. However, there is limited data examining gender inequities in salary in pediatric hospital medicine (PHM). Our primary objective was to assess whether gender-based salary differences exist in PHM. The secondary objective was to assess if, among women, the differences in salary varied on the basis of leadership positions or self-identified race and ethnicity. Methods: We conducted a survey-based, cross-sectional study of pediatric hospitalists in December 2021. Our primary outcomes were base and total salary, adjusted for the reported number of average weekly work hours. We performed subanalyses by presence of a leadership position, as well as race. We used a weighted t test using inverse probability weighting to compare the outcomes between genders. Results: A total of 559 eligible people responded to our survey (51.0%). After propensity score weighting, women's mean base salary was 87.7% of men's base (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.8%-96.4%, P < .01), and women's total salary was 85.6% of men's total (95% CI 73.2%-100.0%, P = .05) salary. On subgroup analysis of respondents with a leadership position, women's total salary was 80.6% of men's total salary (95% CI 68.7%-94.4%, P < .01). Although women who identified as white had base salaries that were 86.6% of white men's base salary (95% CI 78.5%-95.5%, P < .01), there was no gender-based difference noted between respondents that identified as nonwhite (88.4% [69.9%-111.7%] for base salary, 80.3% [57.2% to 112.7%]).

"Influence of Age, Sex, and Generation on Physician Payments and Clinical Activity in Ontario, Canada: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis","Buys, YM; Canizares, M; Felfeli, T; Jin, YP","PURPOSE: To compare the effect of age, sex and generation on physician practice patterns in Ontario, Canada.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.METHODS: Physician and patient data from 1992-2013 were used to calculate the yearly number of physicians, distinct patients seen, patient visits, government payments, physician age, sex, specialty, and year of birth. Age-period-cohort models were used for analysis.RESULTS: There was a negligible change in the number of distinct patients for all physicians and family physicians and a 20.6% decrease for ophthalmologists. There were small declines in yearly visits for all physicians (14.2%) and family physicians (17.3%) and a 10.0% increase for ophthalmologists. There were a lower number of visits (and patients for ophthalmologists) in each succeeding recent birth cohort. For all groups and birth cohorts, male physicians had a significantly greater number of visits and patients. Median payments increased over time in all groups and were less for women with an average women-to-men ratio of 0.64 for all physicians, 0.75 for family physicians, and 0.59 for ophthalmologists. After adjusting for the number of visits and patients, sex differences in payments remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists but were no longer significant for family physicians.CONCLUSION: Younger cohorts of Ontario physicians have greater yearly payments compared with older cohorts at the same age despite similar or a slightly lower number of visits and patients. The sex gap of payments was mostly explained by differences in the number of patients and visits for family physicians but remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists.

"Analysis of Gender-based Differences in Surgery Faculty Compensation, Promotion, and Retention <i>Establishing Equity</i>","Hoops, HE; Brasel, KJ; Dewey, E; Rodgers, S; Merrill, J; Hunter, JG; Azarow, KS","Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate gender-based differences in faculty salaries before and after implementation of a university-wide objective compensation plan, Faculty First (FF), in alignment with Association of American Medical Colleges regional median salary (AAMC-WRMS). Gender-based differences in promotion and retention were also assessed.Summary Background Data: Previous studies demonstrate that female faculty within surgery are compensated less than male counterparts are and have decreased representation in higher academic ranks and leadership positions.Methods: At a single institution, surgery faculty salaries and work relative value units (wRVUs) were reviewed from 2009 to 2017, and time to promotion and retention were reviewed from 1998 to 2007. In 2015, FF supplanted specialty-specific compensation plans. Salaries and wRVUs relative to AAMC-WRMS, time to promotion, and retention were compared between genders.Results: Female faculty (N = 24) were compensated significantly less than males were (N = 62) before FF (P = 0.004). Female faculty compensation significantly increased after FF (P < 0.001). After FF, female and male faculty compensation was similar (P = 0.32). Average time to promotion for female (N = 29) and male faculty (N = 82) was similar for promotion to associate professor (P = 0.49) and to full professor (P = 0.37). Promotion was associated with significantly higher retention for both genders (P < 0.001). The median time of departure was similar between female and male faculty (P = 0.73).Conclusions: A university-wide objective compensation plan increased faculty salaries to the AAMC western region median, allowing correction of gender-based salary inequity.

Results revealed that, controlling for mothers' warmth, fathers' warmth predicts adolescents' positive beliefs and that these relations vary by adolescents' gender. For male adolescents, relations between fathers' warmth and English language arts grades are mediated by academic self-efficacy and determination to persist on challenging schoolwork. For female adolescents, relations between fathers' warmth and math grades are mediated by optimism and determination.

This study provides an update on the income gap between men and women in dentistry, evaluating the impact of dentists' household, personal, and employment characteristics on income differences.Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the US Census Bureau's 5-year American Community Survey (2014-2018). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis (ordinary least squares regressions, Oaxaca-Blinder regression decomposition on logged personal income).Results. Female dentists were less likely to be White and born in the United States and more likely to be bilingual than male dentists. Adjusted estimates indicated that male dentists earned 22% more than female dentists (risk ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.29). Black dentists earned 24% less (risk ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.85) and other race non-Hispanic dentists earned 17% less (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97) than non-Hispanic White dentists, after adjustment for covariates. Dentists with a nondentist partner or spouse earned more than those without a partner or spouse, and dentists with 3 or more children earned 19% more than those who were childless (P <.001; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.31). The income gap between sexes was $51,784 (in 2018 dollars); 27.2% of this gap was explained by observable personal (that is, race and ethnicity, bilingualism), employment (for example, hours worked and employee or ownership status), and household (for example, partner or spouse occupation and education) characteristics.Conclusions.

"Spatial Analysis of the Gender Wage Gap in Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Construction Occupations in the United States","Manesh, SN; Choi, JO; Shrestha, BK; Lim, J; Shrestha, PP","Over the last recent decades, the economic status of women has been changed significantly. Gender segregation levels have decreased, and women have started participating in male-dominated occupations like construction occupations.

So far, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the gender wage gap in the construction occupation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to portray the gender wage gap in construction occupations. Additionally, the spatial analysis of the gender wage gap is of paramount importance not only for its academic interest but also for its major role in area-based public policies that are targeted at eliminating inequalities. The researchers used recent survey data and commercially available software for spatial analysis. Analyses were performed at global (Moran's I) and local [local indicators of spatial association (LISA)] levels to test for the presence of spatial patterns. The results of the LISA analysis have shown spatial autocorrelation at local levels, which highlights the status of gender wage gaps in construction-related occupations in various states.

We show that choices in high school and in higher education are partly driven by expected earnings for boys but less for girls. Boys choose more often courses with a component in Sciences and competitive pathways. In high school, gender differences are higher for pupils at the same level in Mathematics and Humanities and are largely due to differences in marginal impact of test scores, Which are lower for girls.

Highly Skilled Women Reaching the Top: A Cost-free Achievement? Analyzing the Gender Promotion Gap in the Medical Profession,"Gaiaschi, C","This paper investigates the gender promotion gap in a particular highly skilled profession, that of physicians. The following analyses are based on a dataset of more than a thousand doctorsworking in Italy, a country in which hospitals play a central role in the national health care system. Given a three-step career ladder-first level, vice, and head-this research finds that women are 8% less likely than men to be promoted from the first level to vice, whereas no significant disadvantage is found in the promotion from vice to head. This suggests that the vertical segregation is due more to a sticky floors mechanism than to a glass ceiling effect. Moreover, no motherhood penalty occurs. Private organizations appear to be more gender equal than public ones and similar, albeitweaker, findings come from the analysis of the specialties, cautiously suggesting that the male-dominated area of surgery is more gender equal than the female-dominated area of medicine. These findings point out that women in highly skilled professions may encounter fewer obstacles to promotion than in the general labor market. Furthermore, they may encounter fewer obstacles within the most competitive organizations and specialty areas than across the profession in general. This is not, however, because of a greater number of opportunities, but because they represent a highly selected and career-oriented population. These results shed light on the costs of such achievement for women, both in terms of effort and in terms of equality among women themselves.",2021,,SOCIAL FORCES,100,2,622-648,WOS:000747932200033,10.1093/sf/soab026,,#473,Gaiaschi 2021,"",""

"Recruitment, Promotion, and Retention of Women in Academic Medicine: How Institutions Are Addressing Gender Disparities","Carr, PL; Gunn, C; Raj, A; Kaplan, S; Freund, KM","Objective: Greater numbers of women in medicine have not resulted in more women achieving senior positions. Programs supporting the recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine could help to achieve greater advancement of more women to leadership positions. Qualitative research was conducted to understand such programs at 23 institutions and, using the social ecological model, examine how they operate at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels.Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted with faculty representatives (n = 44) of the Group on Women in Medicine and Science, Diversity and Inclusion, or senior leaders with knowledge on gender climate in 24 medical schools. Four trained interviewers conducted semistructured interviews that addressed faculty perceptions of gender equity and advancement, which were audiotaped and transcribed. The data were categorized into three content areas-recruitment, promotion, and retention-and coded a priori for each area based on their social ecological level of operation.Findings: Participants from nearly 40% of the institutions reported no special programs for recruiting, promoting, or retaining women, largely describing such programming as unnecessary. Existing programs primarily targeted the individual and interpersonal levels simultaneously, via training, mentoring, and networking, or the institutional level, via search committee trainings, child and elder care, and spousal hiring programs. Lesser effort at the academic community and policy levels were described.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that many U.S. medical schools have no programs supporting gender equity among medical faculty. Existing programs primarily target the individual or interpersonal level of the social ecological interaction. The academic community and broader policy environment require greater focus as levels with little attention to advancing women's careers. Universal multilevel efforts are needed to more effectively advance the careers of medical women faculty and support gender equity. (C) 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

Work Activities and Compensation of Male and Female Cardiologists,"Jagsi, R; Biga, C; Poppas, A; Rodgers, GP; Walsh, MN; White, PJ; McKendry, C; Sasson, J; Schulte, PJ; Douglas, PS","BACKGROUND Much remains unknown about experiences, including working activities and pay, of women in cardiology, which is a predominantly male specialty.OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe the working activities and pay of female cardiologists compared with their male colleagues and to determine whether sex differences in compensation exist after accounting for differences in work activities and other characteristics.METHODS The personal, job, and practice characteristics of a national sample of practicing cardiologists were described according to sex. We applied the Peters-Belson technique and multivariate regression analysis to evaluate whether gender differences in compensation existed after accounting for differences in other measured characteristics. The study used 2013 data reported by practice administrators to MedAxiom, a subscription-based service provider to cardiology practices. Data regarding cardiologists from 161 U.S. practices were included, and the study sample included 2,679 subjects (229 women and 2,450 men).RESULTS Women were more likely to be specialized in general/noninvasive cardiology (53.1% vs. 28.2%), and a lower proportion (11.4% vs. 39.3%) reported an interventional subspecialty compared with men. Job characteristics that differed according to sex included the proportion working full-time (79.9% vs. 90.9%; p < 0.001), the mean number of half-days worked (387 vs. 406 days; p = 0.001), and mean work relative value units generated (7,404 vs. 9,497; p < 0.001) for women and men, respectively. Peters-Belson analysis revealed that based on measured job and productivity characteristics, the women in this sample would have been expected to have a mean salary that was $31,749 (95% confidence interval: $16,303 to $48,028) higher than that actually observed. Multivariate analysis confirmed the direction and magnitude of the independent association between sex and salary.CONCLUSIONS Men and women practicing cardiology in this national sample had different job activities and salaries. Substantial sex-based salary differences existed even after adjusting for measures of personal, job, and practice characteristics.

Assessment of Gender-Based Linguistic Differences in Physician Trainee Evaluations of Medical Faculty Using Automated Text Mining,"Heath, JK; Weissman, GE; Clancy, CB; Shou, HC; Farrar, JT; Dine, CJ","IMPORTANCE Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender.OBJECTIVE To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1-and 2-word phrases. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation.RESULTS A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]). The individual words art (odds ratio [OR], 7.78; 95% CI, 1.01-59.89), trials (OR, 4.43; 95% CI, 1.34-14.69), master (OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.69-10.63), and humor (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.44-3.73) were significantly associated with evaluations of male faculty, whereas the words empathetic (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.56-12.07), delight (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.35-13.40), and warm (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.83-6.49) were significantly associated with evaluations of female faculty. Two-word phrases associated with male faculty evaluations included run rounds (OR, 7.78; 95% CI, 1.01-59.84), big picture (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 1.68-30.42), and master clinician (OR, 4.02; 95% CI, 1.21-13.36), whereas evaluations of female faculty were more likely to be associated with model physician (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.70-35.39), just right (OR, 6.97; 95% CI, 1.51-32.30), and attention (to) detail (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.36-13.40).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The data showed quantifiable linguistic differences between free-text comments about male and female faculty in physician trainee evaluations.

CHOICE OF FIELD OF STUDY AND WAGE OF INSERTION. ARE THERE GENDER DIFFERENCES?,"Bartual-Figueras, MT; Daza-Pérez, L; Purroy-Sánchez, P; Sierra-Martínez, FJ; Simó-Solsona, M; Turmo-Garuz, J","This paper analyzes the relationship between fields of study, wage and gender, in order to determine the causal relationship between them. We have used data from the survey made by the AQU (Agencia per a la Qualitat del Sistema Universitari de Catalunya) in 2017 on the insertion of recent university graduates from Catalonia (Spain). The quantitative analysis has been carried out by statistical exploitation of the survey through frequency and contingency tables. Degrees have been classified as masculinized and feminized, according to the percentage of men and women graduated in each case, in relation to the percentage of total graduates of each sex. The results show three relevant aspects. First, from an aggregate perspective, there is evidence of a gender wage gap, with a higher proportion of women in the lowest wage levels and a higher proportion of men among the highest wage levels; being the threshold between both the salary level of 24,000 euros per year. Second, the statistical analysis shows the existence of gender segregation by field of study, so that clearly masculinized and feminized fields of study can be distinguished: for example, engineering is clearly masculinized, while health sciences and education are feminized. Thirdly, there are salary differences by fields of study, which seem to be associated with the masculinized or feminized nature of the field of study: feminized degrees have a higher percentage of individuals in the lowest salary sections while masculinized degrees concentrate the sections of higher salaries. In conclusion, the existence of gender pay differences is related, on the one hand, with gender discrimination itself and, on the other hand, with the choice of field of study.",2019,,"12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2019)",,,3657-3661,WOS:000530109203117,,,#487,Bartual-Figueras 2019,"",""
The Gender Wage Gap Among College Graduates in Italy,"Piazzalunga, D","The paper investigates the gender wage gap among recently graduates, controlling for job and academic variables and for the field of study, as women lag behind in highly remunerative majors. The raw gender differential in hourly wages is 5.6%. Although including academic variables and the field of study-on top of job-related variables-slightly reduces the unexplained gap, the latter still accounts for most of the total difference. Using quantile decomposition, the paper shows that the unexplained gap increases along the wage distribution, indicating a glass ceiling effect. Heterogeneities arise among fields of study: the largest total gap emerges in Law, Political-Social sciences, and Economics-Statistics. In most disciplines, there is a significant unexplained gap-from 3.3% (Medicine), to 8.7% (Law), up to 9.6% (Agriculture)-which constitutes the largest share of the difference, confirming that most of the wage gap remains unexplained also by major. Finally, I use geographical differences to explore the influence of institutional and macro-economic variables, as well as of attitudes towards gender norms. The results indicate that childcare and part-time employment availability are correlated with lower gender wage gaps, while traditional gender norms are associated with higher differentials.",2018,,ITALIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,4,1,33-90,WOS:000430881500002,10.1007/s40797-017-0069-8,,#488,Piazzalunga 2018,"",""
"Influence of Age, Sex, and Generation on Physician Payments and Clinical Activity in Ontario, Canada: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis","Buys, YM; Canizares, M; Felfeli, T; Jin, YP","PURPOSE: To compare the effect of age, sex and generation on physician practice patterns in Ontario, Canada.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.METHODS: Physician and patient data from 1992 to 2013 were used to calculate yearly number of physicians, distinct patients seen, patient visits, government payments, physician age, sex, specialty, and year of birth. Age-period-cohort models were used for analysis.RESULTS: There was a negligible change in the number of distinct patients for all physicians and family physicians and a 20.6% decrease for ophthalmologists. There were small declines in yearly visits for all physicians (14.2%) and family physicians (17.3%) and a 10.0% increase for ophthalmologists. There was a lower number of visits (and patients for ophthalmologists) in each succeeding recent birth cohort. For all groups and birth cohorts, male physicians had significantly greater number of visits and patients. Median payments increased over time in all groups and were less for women with an average women to -men ratio of 0.64 for all physicians, 0.75 for family physicians, and 0.59 for ophthalmologists. After adjusting for the number of visits and patients, sex differences in payments remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists but were no longer significant for family physicians.CONCLUSION: Younger cohorts of Ontario physicians have greater yearly payments compared to older cohorts at the same age despite similar or slightly fewer numbers of visits and patients. The sex gap of payments was mostly explained by differences in the number of patients and visits for family physicians, but remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists.

Our framework contains a three-component deterministic cycle of (1) production of Achievements from Resources, (2) updated community Status due to Achievements, and (3) accrual of additional Resources based on community Status. A fourth component, stochastic Events, can influence an individual's level of Resources or Achievements at each time step of the cycle. We build a specific mathematical model within the RASE framework and use it to investigate the impact of accumulated disadvantages from multiple compounding variables. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce data of observed disparities in academia. Finally, we use a publicly available visualization and networking tool to provide a sandbox for exploring career outcomes within the model.

Using univariate and bivariate analyses, we compared the differences in surgical practice, compensation, family life, and health status among female and male trauma surgeons and used chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 25, IBM).Results: The overall response rate was 37.4%. Women reported working more than 80 h a week more commonly (30% versus 23%; P < 0.001), yet reported lower incomes, with 57% of female surgeons reporting before-tax incomes of $300,000 or higher, compared with 83% of male surgeons (P < 0.001). These differences persisted when adjusting for academic versus nonacademic practices. Gender-based salary disparity remained significant when adjusting for the age of the respondent. Divorce rates and never married status were significantly higher for women (9% versus 4%; P < 0.001 and 19% versus 4%; P < 0.001, respectively). Women surgeons also report higher rates of not having children compared with male surgeons (48% versus 13%; P < 0.001).

For all three cohorts, we find strong evidence of sorting along gendered lines, which has decreased over time, yet there is no erosion of the gender gap in the tendency to sort into occupations with the highest share of males. Within the cohort, we find little evidence that childhood variables change the tendency for females of either the average or highest ability to sort substantively differently.

We examined how gender is implicated in the content, quality, and consequences of one low-promotability workplace task: assessment. By analyzing real-world behavioral data that include 33,456 in-the-moment numerical and textual evaluations of 359 resident physicians (subordinates) by 285 attending physicians (superordinates) in eight U.S. hospitals, and by combining qualitative methods and machine learning, we found that, compared to men, women attendings wrote more words in their comments to residents, used more job-related terms, and were more likely to provide helpful feedback, particularly when residents were struggling. Additionally, we found women residents were less likely to receive substantive evaluations, regardless of attending gender. Our findings suggest that workplace assessment is gendered in three ways: women (superordinates) spend more time on this low-promotability task, they are more cognitively engaged with assessment, and women (subordinates) are less likely to fully benefit from quality assessment.

The scholarly output of women scientists remains significantly lower than that of men due to limited opportunities. This widening gap has significant implications for policy-making and prioritizing agendas. The Supporting Women in Science (SWIS) programme aims to address these barriers by enhancing research capacity among early- and mid-career women scientists from LMIC regions such as South-Central Asia and East Africa, in bespoke areas of health and health-related sustainable development goals (HHSDGs). Methods The SWIS programme utilizes online and distance learning with a self-paced approach. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, through a pre-defined eligibility criterion. Phase I involves online self-learning courses covering a core and elective curriculum over 6 months which is then evaluated in Phase II. Eligible candidates then move to Phase III, a mentored fellowship where they develop research proposals and receive funding for research project development, implementation, and evaluation. The rigorous reporting and monitoring mechanisms track compliance and progress. The online format, offered at no cost, enhances program accessibility, particularly in the post-COVID era.

Referring and Specialist Physician Gender and Specialist Billing,"Chami, N; Weir, S; Shaikh, SA; Sibley, LM; Simkin, S; Wright, JG; Kantarevic, J","IMPORTANCE While a gender pay gap in medicine has been well documented, relatively little research has addressed mechanisms that mediate gender differences in referral income for specialists.OBJECTIVE To examine gender-based disparities in medical and surgical specialist referrals in Ontario, Canada.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study included referrals for specialist care ascertained from Ontario Health Insurance Plan physician billings for fiscal year 2018 to 2019. Participants were specialist physicians who received new patient consultations from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019, and the associated referring physicians. Datawere analyzed from April 2018 to March 2020, including a 12-month follow-up period.EXPOSURES Specialist and referring physician gender (female or male).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Revenue per referral was defined based on an episode-of-care approach as total billings for a 12-month period from the initial consultation. Mean total billings for female and male specialists were compared and the differential divided into the portion owing to referral volume vs referral revenue. Difference-in-differences multivariable regression analysis was used to estimate gender-based differences in revenue per referral. For each referring physician, gender-based differences in referral patterns were examined using case-control analysis, in which specialists who received a referral were compared with matched control specialists who did not receive a referral. This analysis considered the gender of the specialist and concordance between the gender of the referring physician and specialist, among other characteristics.RESULTS Of 7 621 365 new referrals, 32 824 referring physicians, of whom 13 512 (41.2%) were female (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [11.6] years) and 19 312 (58.8%) were male (mean [SD] age, 52.9 [13.5] years), made referrals to 13 582 specialists, of whom 4890 (36.0%) were female (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [11.0] years) and 8692 (64.0%) were male (mean [SD] age, 51.8 [13.0] years). Male specialists received more mean (SD) referrals than did female specialists (633 [666] vs 433 [515]), and the mean (SD) revenue per referral was higher for males ($350 [$474]) compared with females ($316 [$393]). Adjusted analysis demonstrated a -4.7%(95% CI, -4.9% to -4.5%) difference in the revenue per referral between male and female specialists. Multivariable regression analysis found that physicians referred more often to specialists of the same gender (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) but had higher odds of referring to male specialists (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.09-1.11).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of the gender pay gap in specialist referral income, the number and revenue from referrals received differed by gender, as did the odds of receiving a referral from a physician of the same gender. Future research should examine the effectiveness of different policies to address this gap, such as a centralized, gender-blinded referral system.",2023,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,6,8,,WOS:001079007100001,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.28347,,#501,Chami 2023,"",""
"Suturing the gender gap: Income, marriage, and parenthood among Japanese Surgeons","Okoshi, K; Nomura, K; Taka, F; Fukami, K; Tomizawa, Y; Kinoshita, K; Tominaga, R","Background. In Japan, gender inequality between males and females in the medical profession still exists. We examined gender gaps in surgeons' incomes.Methods. Among 8,316 surgeons who participated in a 2012 survey by the Japan Surgical Society, 546 women and 1,092 men within the same postgraduation year were selected randomly with a female-to-male sampling ratio of 1:2 (mean age, 36 years; mean time since graduation, 10.6 years).Results. Average annual income was 9.2 million JPY for women and 11.3 million JPY for men (P < .0001). A general linear regression model showed that the average income of men remained 1.5 million JPY greater after adjusting for gender, age, marital status, number of children, number of beds, current position, and working hours (Model 1). In Model 2, in which 2 statistical interaction terms between annual income and gender with marital status and number of children were added together with variables in Model 1, both interactions became significant, and the gender effect became nonsignificant. For men, average annual income increased by 1.1 million JPY (P < .0001) when they were married and by 0.36 million JPY per child (P = .0014). In contrast, for women, annual income decreased by 0.73 million JPY per child (P = .0005).Conclusions. Male surgeons earn more than female surgeons, even after adjusting for other factors that influenced a surgeon's salary. In addition, married men earn more than unmarried men, but no such trend is observed for women. Furthermore, as the number of children increases, annual income increases for men but decreases for women.",2016,,SURGERY,159,5,1249-1259,WOS:000374208400002,10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.020,,#502,Okoshi 2016,"",""
"Distinct Influences of Mothers and Fathers on Kindergartners' Numeracy Performance: The Role of Math Anxiety, Home Numeracy Practices, and Numeracy Expectations","del Río, MF; Susperreguy, MI; Strasser, K; Salinas, V","The current study analyzed maternal and paternal differential influences on numeracy performance in kindergarten children. Participants were 180 Chilean children from backgrounds of low and high socioeconomic status (SES), their mothers, and their fathers. A path analysis was used to explore the influences of both maternal and paternal numeracy practices on children's numeracy performance and the influences of maternal and paternal expectations and anxiety on those activities. Research Findings: Results showed that mothers and fathers who endorse higher numeracy expectations for their children and who report lower levels of math anxiety also report engaging more frequently in advanced numeracy practices with their children. Mothers'-but not fathers'-engagement in numeracy practices at home predicted children's numeracy performance. Also, low-SES mothers engaged more frequently in numeracy practices with their children, and mothers in general engaged more often in numeracy activities with girls than with boys.

Feminisation of the health workforce and wage conditions of health professions: an exploratory analysis,"Shannon, G; Minckas, N; Tan, D; Haghparast-Bidgoli, H; Batura, N; Mannell, J","Background The feminisation of the global health workforce presents a unique challenge for human resource policy and health sector reform which requires an explicit gender focus. Relatively little is known about changes in the gender composition of the health workforce and its impact on drivers of global health workforce dynamics such as wage conditions. In this article, we use a gender analysis to explore if the feminisation of the global health workforce leads to a deterioration of wage conditions in health. Methods We performed an exploratory, time series analysis of gender disaggregated WageIndicator data. We explored global gender trends, wage gaps and wage conditions over time in selected health occupations. We analysed a sample of 25 countries over 9 years between 2006 and 2014, containing data from 970,894 individuals, with 79,633 participants working in health occupations (48,282 of which reported wage data). We reported by year, country income level and health occupation grouping. Results The health workforce is feminising, particularly in lower- and upper-middle-income countries. This was associated with a wage gap for women of 26 to 36% less than men, which increased over time. In lower- and upper-middle-income countries, an increasing proportion of women in the health workforce was associated with an increasing gender wage gap and decreasing wage conditions. The gender wage gap was pronounced in both clinical and allied health professions and over lower-middle-, upper-middle- and high-income countries, although the largest gender wage gaps were seen in allied healthcare occupations in lower-middle-income countries. Conclusion These results, if a true reflection of the global health workforce, have significant implications for health policy and planning and highlight tensions between current, purely economic, framing of health workforce dynamics and the need for more extensive gender analysis. They also highlight the value of a more nuanced approach to health workforce planning that is gender sensitive, specific to countries' levels of development, and considers specific health occupations.",2019,,HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH,17,1,,WOS:000490998900001,10.1186/s12960-019-0406-0,,#507,Shannon 2019,"",""
Higher research productivity = more pay?

Adding to scholarship around structural barriers to gender equity in academic settings, we investigate the link between scholarly performance and compensation. We expect high research productivity to be differentially associated with compensation outcomes for men and women. Building on social role theory, we hypothesize that these relationships are contingent upon whether researchers are inside or outside of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Using the h-index, compensation, and researcher demographics for 3033 STEM and social and behavioral sciences (SBS) researchers from 17 R1 universities, we applied multilevel modeling techniques and showed that cumulative research productivity was more strongly related to compensation for men versus women researchers. However, these effects only held in STEM disciplines but not in SBS disciplines.

"Preferences, constraints, and the process of sex segregation in college majors: A choice analysis","Ochsenfeld, F","The persistence of horizontal sex segregation in higher education continues to puzzle social scientists. To help resolve this puzzle, we analyze a sample of college entrants in Germany with a discrete choice design that allows for social learning from the experiences of others. We make at least two contributions to the state of research. First, we test whether essentialist gender stereotypes affect major selection mostly through internalization or rather as external constraints that high school graduates adapt their behavior to. Empirically, we find that internalized vocational interests better explain gendered major choices than conformance with friends' and parents' expectations does. Second, we scrutinize whether segregation results from women's anticipation of gendered family roles or from their anticipation of sex-based discrimination, but we find no evidence for either of these hypotheses. As in most previous studies, differences in mathematics achievement fail to explain gendered patterns of selection into college majors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Gender Issues in Academic Hospital Medicine: a National Survey of Hospitalist Leaders,"Herzke, C; Bonsall, J; Bertram, A; Yeh, HC; Apfel, A; Cofrancesco, J","Background Gender inequities are documented in academic medicine. Within General Internal Medicine (GIM), there are fewer female division directors and first and last authors on publications. With gender parity in US medical school graduates and with Academic Hospital (AH) medicine being a relatively newer discipline, one might postulate that AH would have less gender inequity. Design A national survey of AH programs was developed via literature review and expert recommendations. Domains included program and faculty information. Gender of the leader was determined via website or telephone call. Participants Leaders of AH programs associated with the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Programs without a primary teaching hospital or hospitalist program and those not staffed by university-affiliated physicians were excluded. Main Measures Description and characteristics of leaders and programs including a multivariable analysis of gender of hospitalist leaders and the portion of female faculty. Key Results 59% response rate (80 of 135); there were no differences between responders/non-responders in NIH funding (p = 0.12), type of institution (p = 0.09), geographic region (p = 0.15), or year established (p = 0.86). Reported number of female and male faculty were approximately equal. 80% of hospitalist leaders were male; 37% of male hospitalist leaders were professors, no female leaders were professors. In univariate and multivariate analysis only the number of hospitals staffed was a significant predictor of having a female hospitalist leader. There were no significant predictors of having fewer female faculty. Conclusion This study demonstrated gender inequality in academic hospital medicine regarding leadership and rank. Though there was equal gender distribution of faculty, among leaders most were men and all ""full professors"" were men.

Aggregate decompositions show that composition effects are similar across the distribution while structural effects are larger further up the distribution, therefore driving wider gaps in high-wage positions. Detailed composition effects show that high school type, field of study, firm size and occupation explain at least 50% of the wage gaps. Major drivers include low rates of women in high school science tracks; university engineering courses; large firms; and manufacturing, sales and trade occupations as well as high rates of women in small firms and administrative, health and social welfare occupations.

The gender gap in authorship and editorial boards in gynecologic oncology, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been recently evaluated. We examined gender representation and the impact of COVID-19 on authorship and editorial boards of two major peer-reviewed gynecologic oncology journals. Methods We conducted a bibliometric analysis of original articles published in Gynecologic Oncology and the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer, comparing the most contemporary 5-year period (2016-2020) to single years in the two prior decades (1996, 2006). To assess the early impact of COVID-19, we compared publications from May 2020-April 2021 to 2019. Editorial boards were analyzed for gender composition. First names, pronouns, and institutional photographs were used to determine gender. Results There were 3022 original articles published between 2016 and 2020, 763 in 2006, and 203 in 1996. Gender was identified for 91.3% of first authors (3641 articles) and 95.6% of senior authors (3813 articles). Men comprised the majority of the editorial boards in 2021 at 57% and 61% for Gynecologic Oncology and the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer, respectively. Men were overrepresented as senior authors across all study periods: 93% in 1996, 77% in 2006, and 58% in 2016-2020. Over time, representation of women as first and senior authors increased (7% in 1996, 42% in 2016-2020, p<0.00001). There was no immediate impact of the early pandemic on gender distribution of authorship. Conclusions Despite greater representation of women over time as authors in gynecologic oncology journals, there remains gender disparity in senior authorship and editorial board representation.

The missing women in STEM? Assessing gender differentials in the factors associated with transition to first jobs,"Sassler, S; Glass, J; Levitte, Y; Michelmore, KM","Women remain underrepresented in the STEM workforce. We assess explanations for women's underrepresentation in STEM jobs, focusing on a cohort that came of age in the 1980s and 1990s, when women dramatically increased their representation in the scientific labor force. Data are from the NLSY79, and our analysis focuses on members of this cohort who received a college degree, with an emphasis on those who completed a degree in a STEM field. Our analyses test the extent to which college major, expectations to work in STEM, and family expectations shaped transitions into STEM occupations within two years of degree completion. Among those majoring in STEM fields there were no gender differences in transitioning into STEM jobs, though there were sizable differences in transitions to STEM employment by field of study. Of note are gender differences in associations between family expectations and transitions into STEM employment. The most career oriented women, who expected to marry late and limit fertility, were no more likely to enter STEM jobs than were women who anticipated marrying young and having two or more children. The men most likely to enter STEM occupations, in contrast, adhered to significantly more conventional gender ideologies than their female counterparts, expecting to marry at younger ages but also to remain childless. Results of our regression decomposition indicated that marriage and family expectations and gender ideology worked in opposite directions for men and women. Nonetheless, the majority of the gender disparity in transitions into STEM jobs was related to women's underrepresentation in engineering and computer science fields of study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Academic Gender Disparity in Orthopedic Surgery in Canadian Universities,"Yue, T; Khosa, F","IntroductionAcademic medicine is notorious for being ""male-dominated."" We hypothesized that there were significant and quantifiable levels of gender disparity in academic orthopedic surgery, and this article attempts to quantify the extent of the existing disparity. Also, we examined the research productivity of academic faculty in orthopedic surgery and its correlation with academic ranks and leadership positions.MethodsOur study design was cross-sectional in nature. We searched the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) to compile a list of medical schools that offer orthopedic surgery training for residency. A total of 713 academic orthopedic surgeons met our inclusion criteria. Of the 713 orthopedic surgeons, 518 had an H-index score available on Elsevier's Scopus (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The gender, academic rank, leadership position, and H-index were compared. Data analysis was done with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM, Armonk, NY).

Design: Cross-sectional observational study (II-3). Setting: Accredited Obstetrics and Gynecology residency programs. Participants: A total of 288 accredited residency programs were identified from 2019 to 2020 with 1237 individuals in leadership positions. Interventions: Similar to a 2012 to 2013 survey by Hofler et al, residency program websites and corresponding fellowships (Maternal Fetal Medicine, Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and Gynecologic Oncology), departmental websites, and divisional websites were queried for those in administrative and educational leadership positions. Information regarding gender (as determined by the surrogates of name and photographic gender expression), medical and academic degrees, academic rank, and subspecialty certification was abstracted. Measurements and Main Results: Within administrative leadership roles, women comprised 29% of chairs, 46% of vice chairs, and 47% of division directors, all significantly lower than men in administrative leadership (p <.001). In educational leadership, women made up 71% of medical school clerkship directors, 58% of residency directors, and 50% fellowship directors. Women were more likely to hold educational leadership positions (56% vs 40%; p <.001), although men were more likely to hold administrative leadership positions (68% vs 52%; p <. 001). Among subspecialties, there was greatest gender equity within Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery.

Reponses were anonymous.Results: Of the 303 respondents (21%), there was an even distribution across geographic region, age, and gender (54% men). Gender affected perception of salary and promotion; 46% of men but only 9% of women feel that ""women earn the same as men"" (P<0.001). Similarly, 48% of men but only 12% of women feel that ""women rise at the same rate as men'' (P<0.001). Both genders of academic practice respondents, compared with other practice models, perceived men were promoted more quickly than women (P = 0.008).

Study of Salary Differentials by Gender and Discipline,"Billard, L","Although it is 45 years since legislation made gender discrimination on university campuses illegal, salary inequities continue to exist today. The seminal work in studying the existence of salary inequities is that of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), by Scott (1977) and Gray (1980). Subsequently, innumerable analyses based on versions of their multiple regression model have been published. Salary is the dependent variable and is modeled to depend on various independent predictor variables such as years employed. Often, indicator terms, for gender and/or discipline are included in the model as independent predicator variables. Unfortunately, many of these studies are not well grounded in basic statistical science. The most glaring omission is the failure to include indicator by predictor interaction terms in the model when required. The present work draws attention to the broader implications of using these models incorrectly, and the difficulties that ensuewhen they are not built on an appropriate sound statistical framework. Another issue surrounds the inclusion of ""tainted"" predictor variables that are themselves gender-biased, the most contentious being the (intuitive) choice of rank. Therefore, a brief look at this issue is included; unfortunately, it is shown that rank still today seems to persist as a tainted variable.",2017,,STATISTICS AND PUBLIC POLICY,4,1,,WOS:000424591600007,10.1080/2330443X.2017.1317223,,#530,Billard 2017,"",""

Inadequate Progress for Women in Academic Medicine: Findings from the National Faculty Study,"Carr, PL; Gunn, CM; Kaplan, SA; Raj, A; Freund, KM","Background: Women have entered academic medicine in significant numbers for 4 decades and now comprise 20% of full-time faculty. Despite this, women have not reached senior positions in parity with men. We sought to explore the gender climate in academic medicine as perceived by representatives to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Group on Women in Medicine and Science (GWIMS) and Group on Diversity and Inclusion (GDI).Methods: We conducted a qualitative analysis of semistructured telephone interviews with GWIMS and GDI representatives and other senior leaders at 24 randomly selected medical schools of the 1995 National Faculty Study. All were in the continental United States, balanced for public/private status and AAMC geographic region. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and organized into content areas before an inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Themes that were expressed by multiple informants were studied for patterns of association.Results: Five themes were identified: (1) a perceived wide spectrum in gender climate; (2) lack of parity in rank and leadership by gender; (3) lack of retention of women in academic medicine (the ""leaky pipeline""); (4) lack of gender equity in compensation; and (5) a disproportionate burden of family responsibilities and work-life balance on women's career progression.Conclusions: Key informants described improvements in the climate of academic medicine for women as modest.

Gender Disparity in Awards in General Surgery Residency Programs,"Kuo, LE; Lyu, HG; Jarman, MP; Melnitchouk, N; Doherty, GM; Smink, DS; Cho, NL","IMPORTANCE: Women are disproportionately underrecognized as award winners within medical societies. The presence of this disparity has not been investigated in training programs.OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of a gender disparity in award winners in general surgery residency programs.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective survey study, 32 geographically diverse academic and independent general surgery residency programs were solicited for participation. The 24 participating programs (75.0%) submitted deidentified data regarding the gender distribution of residents and trainee award recipients for the period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed from September 11, 2017, to December 21, 2018.EXPOSURES: Time and the proportion of female trainees.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage of female award winners. A multilevel logistic regression model accounting for the percentage of female residents in each program compared the odds of a female resident winning an award relative to a male resident. This analysis was repeated for the first and second decades of the study. Award winners were further analyzed by type of award (clinical excellence, nonclinical excellence, teaching, or research) and selection group (medical students, residents, or faculty members).RESULTS: A total of 5030 of 13 760 resident person-years (36.6%) and 455 of 1447 award winners (31.4%) were female. Overall, female residents were significantly less likely to receive an award compared with male residents (odds ratio [OR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.37-0.54; P < .001). During the first decade of the study, female residents were 70.8% less likely to receive an award compared with male residents (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.45; P < .001); this improved to 49.9% less likely in the second decade (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42-0.61; P < .001).

Best practices utilized by institutions with the most robust parental policies include adopting a formal and public parental policy, providing a parental enrolled academic adjustment option, guaranteeing approval to take and return from leave/ academic adjustment, and continuing health care and financial aid benefits. Given the role of childbearing as a factor associated with gender disparities in academic medicine, and potential impact on racial disparities for students of color, medical school leadership should consider implementation of best practice parental policies to promote equity and wellness of their students.

Female Physicians and the Future of Endocrinology,"Pelley, E; Danoff, A; Cooper, DS; Becker, C","Context: Given that approximately 70% of current endocrinology fellows are women, female physicians will compose the majority of the future endocrinology workforce. This gender shift partly reflects an apparent waning of interest in endocrinology among male trainees. It also coincides with a projected shortage of endocrinologists overall. Female physicians face unique challenges in the workplace. To continue to attract trainees to the specialty and support their success, it is imperative that these challenges be recognized, understood, and addressed.Evidence Acquisition: A PubMed search using the terms ""female physician"" and ""physician gender"" covering the years 2000-2015 was performed. Additional references were identified through review of the citations of the retrieved articles. The following topics were identified as key to understanding the impact of this gender shift: professional satisfaction, work-life balance, income, parenthood, academic success, and patient satisfaction.Evidence Synthesis: Several changes can be predicted to occur as endocrinology becomes a female-predominant specialty. Although professional satisfaction should remain stable, increased burnout rates are likely. Work-life balance challenges will likely be magnified. The combined effects of occupational gender segregation and a gender pay gap are predicted to negatively impact salaries of endocrinologists of both genders. The underrepresentation of women in academic leadership may mean a lesser voice for endocrinology in this arena. Finally, gender biases evident in patient satisfaction measures-commonly used as proxies for quality of care-may disproportionately impact endocrinology.Conclusions: Endocrinology is predicted to become the most female-predominant subspecialty of internal medicine. The specialty of endocrinology should take a lead role in advocating for changes that support the success of female physicians. Strengthening and supporting the physician workforce can only serve to attract talented physicians of both genders to the specialty, which will be key to meeting the needs of the increasing numbers of patients with endocrine disorders.",2016,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,101,1,16-22,WOS:000377212700005,10.1210/jc.2015-3436,,#540,Pelley 2016,"",""

Although PCMC is generally sub-optimal, there are significant disparities. On average, women of low socioeconomic status (SES) tend to receive poorer PCMC than women of higher SES. Yet few studies have explored factors underlying these inequities. In this study, we examined provider implicit and explicit biases that could lead to inequitable PCMC based on SES.MethodsData are from a cross-sectional survey with 150 providers recruited from 19 health facilities in the Upper East region of Ghana from October 2020 to January 2021. Explicit SES bias was assessed using situationally-specific vignettes (low SES and high SES characteristics) on providers' perceptions of women's expectations, attitudes, and behaviors. Implicit SES bias was assessed using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) that measures associations between women's SES characteristics and providers' perceptions of women as 'difficult' or 'good'. Analysis included descriptive statistics, mixed-model ANOVA, and bivariate and multivariate linear regression.ResultsThe average explicit bias score was 18.1 out of 28 (SD = 3.60) for the low SES woman vignette and 16.9 out of 28 (SD = 3.15) for the high SES woman vignette (p < 0.001), suggesting stronger negative explicit bias towards the lower SES woman. These biases manifested in higher agreement to statements such as the low SES woman in the vignette is not likely to expect providers to introduce themselves and is not likely to understand explanations. The average IAT score was 0.71 (SD = 0.43), indicating a significant bias in associating positive characteristics with high SES women and negative characteristics with low SES women. Providers with higher education had significantly lower explicit bias scores on the low SES vignette than those with less education. Providers in private facilities had higher IAT scores than those in government hospitals.ConclusionsThe findings provide evidence of both implicit and explicit SES bias among maternity providers.

Survey Validation for Measuring Perceptions of Work-Related Factors That Influence Career Paths of Men and Women in Academic Anesthesiology,"Hastie, MJ; Kim, M; Katz, D; Lin, MK; Chatterji, M","BACKGROUND: Women's underrepresentation in positions of leadership in medicine has been attributed to environmental, structural, motivational, and situational factors. The purpose of this study was to design and validate a survey instrument based on these constructs, using a sample of men and women anesthesiologists from 3 urban academic medical centers.METHODS: Following institutional review board review, survey domains were defined based on a literature review. Items were developed, and content validation was performed by external experts. Anesthesiologists at 3 academic institutions were invited to complete the anonymous survey. Validation measures were performed on the collected responses, including reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity. In addition, differences between men and women respondents were evaluated.RESULTS: Content validation by external experts yielded 38 items with 5-point Likert scales, defining 3 constructs: environmental (14 items), structural (13 items), and motivational (11 items) factors, with single-item measures on situational factors. Content validity indices used Cohen's Kappa coefficients, with 0.85 as the acceptance cutoff. Two hundred seventy-four anesthesiologists in 3 academic institutions received the online survey. One hundred fifteen responses were received (42% response rate), yielding 103 complete survey responses, of which 86 cases included gender. Cronbach's alpha reliability estimates for the environmental, structural, and motivational scale scores were .88, .84, and .64, respectively, after scale revision. Evidence of convergent (Pearson's r = 0.68; P < .001) and discriminant validity (Pearson's r = 0.017; P = .84) confirmed theoretical expectations. Gender group differences showed statistically significant differences in perceptions toward environmental but not toward structural and motivational factors.CONCLUSIONS: The iterative design and validation processes yielded a 3-scale survey instrument with parsimonious item sets. The preliminary evidence of construct validity and reliability fills a gap in the instrumentation literature for assessing gender issues in medicine.

In this study, the authors sought to identify common microaggressions experienced by women faculty in medicine and to determine if specific demographic characteristics affect the reported frequencies of these microaggressions.MethodThe authors used chain referral sampling to collect real-life anecdotes about microaggressions from women faculty across the nation. Thirty-four unique experiences from those reported were identified and scripted then reenacted using professional actors to create 34 videos of the real-life microaggressions and 34 corresponding fictional ""control"" versions of the same situations. The videos, presented in a random order, were evaluated by faculty from 4 academic medical centers from 2016 to 2018.ResultsA total of 124 faculty (79 women, 45 men) participated. Women reported higher frequencies of microaggressions than men in 33 of the 34 videos depicting microaggressions (P value range: < .001 to .042, area under the curve range: 0.60-0.69). No such differences were seen with the control videos. Women identified 21 microaggressions as occurring frequently. No significant differences were found with respect to participants' age, race/ethnicity, academic rank, or years in medicine.

Specializing in growing sectors: Wage returns and gender differences,"Graves, J; Kuehn, Z","Matching individual data with national statistics for eight high-income OECD countries, we test whether those who specialized in fields of study when related sectors were growing earn higher wages later in life. We estimate 2-3% higher hourly wages for these individuals compared to others of similar characteristics and abilities who made their specialization choices under comparable macroeconomic conditions but when related sectors were not growing. We then test for heterogeneity in both who chooses fields of study associated with growing sectors, as well as in the wage impacts of doing so. We find that men are less likely to specialize in growing fields because they avoid traditionally female fields that have grown more over recent decades (i.e. health care and education). While for men with at least a bachelor's degree, specializing in traditionally female fields is associated with lower wages, this is not the case for men with vocational degrees, for whom non-wage factors must drive their reluctance towards female fields. Countries where men are less likely to specialize in growing fields are characterized by more traditional gender norms but also larger reductions in gender wage gaps.",2021,,LABOUR ECONOMICS,70,,,WOS:000669938300004,10.1016/j.labeco.2021.101994,,#554,Graves 2021,"",""

Biological sensitivity to context in Pakistani preschoolers: Hair cortisol and family wealth are interactively associated with girls' cognitive skills,"Armstrong-Carter, E; Finch, JE; Siyal, S; Yousafzai, AK; Obradovic, J","Many young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face heightened risk for experiencing environmental adversity, which is linked with poorer developmental outcomes. Children's stress physiology can shed light on why children are differentially susceptible to adversity. However, no known studies have examined whether links between adversity and children's development are moderated by children's stress physiology in LMICs. The present study revealed significant interactive effects of hair cortisol concentrations, an index of chronic physiological stress regulation, and family wealth on preschoolers' cognitive skills in rural Pakistan. In a sample of 535 4-year-old children (n = 342 girls), we found significant associations between family wealth and direct assessments of verbal intelligence, pre-academic skills, and executive functions only in girls with lower hair cortisol concentrations. Specifically, girls with lower cortisol concentrations displayed greater cognitive skills if they came from relatively wealthier families, but lower cognitive skills if they came from very poor families. There were no significant associations among boys.

Access to online learning: Machine learning analysis from a social justice perspective,"McIntyre, NA","Access to education is the first step to benefiting from it. Although cumulative online learning experience is linked academic learning gains, between-country inequalities mean that large populations are prevented from accumulating such experience.

COVID-19 has exacerbated the global inequalities, with girls affected more than boys in these regions. Therefore, the present research mined online learning data to identify features that are important for access to online learning.

The findings suggest that food insecurity and poverty differ by the gender of the household head and by the presence (de facto) or absence (de jure) of a spouse among female-headed households (FHHs). On average, FHHs are less food secure and live in more poverty than male-headed households (MHHs). Still, their status would improve if they had the same returns on their observed characteristics as those estimated for MHHs. The results further reveal that the probabilities of food insecurity and poverty would be lower if de jure FHHs had the same returns on their observed characteristics as those estimated for MHHs. The probability of poverty would also be lower if de jure FHHs had the same returns on their observed characteristics as those estimated for de facto FHHs. The likelihood of poverty and food insecurity would remain similar if de facto FHHs had the same returns on their observed characteristics as the ones estimated for MHHs.

Investigating the Determinants of Starting Salary of IT Graduates,"Ge, CM; Kankanhalli, A; Huang, KW","The starting salary of a fresh graduate is considered a potential indicator of career advancement. Yet few studies have examined the determinants of starting salaries of information technology (IT) graduates. Further, existing studies have focused on how demographics affect either the salary or the kind of job the graduate enters into, but rarely both. In this paper, we explore both and examine if entry into an IT job mediates the effects of demographics on the starting salaries of fresh IT graduates. Our model is tested using data from annual surveys of undergraduate students majoring in IT at a large public university in Singapore over a 5-year period. We find that gender and foreigner status influence both starting salary and fresh graduates' entry into an IT vs. non IT job. Further, the effect of gender on the starting salaries of IT graduates is partially mediated by their entry into an IT job. In other words, part of the reason for a gender difference in starting salary could be attributed to female IT majors being less likely to enter IT jobs upon graduation than their male counterparts. On the other hand, foreign IT graduates are more likely to enter IT jobs, yet their starting salaries are found to be lower than local graduates.

The results showed that a large amount of variance (20%) in math scores is explained by the aforementioned variables. These are socio-demographic variables, which ideally should not be indicative of one's academic performance.

Intersectionality and Faculty Compensation in Academic Radiology in US,"Malhotra, A; Futela, D; Khunte, M; Wu, X; Payabvash, S; Gandhi, D; Jordan, JE","Background: The impact of intersectionality on academic radiology physician compensation is not well known. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess impact of intersectionality on academic radiology financial compensation, based on rank, gender and race/ethnicity in US medical schools. Methods: Data were collected from the AAMC Faculty Salary Survey, which collects information for full-time faculty at U.S. medical schools. Financial compensation data for radiology faculty with MD or equivalent degree in diagnostic radiology (DR) as well as interventional radiology (IR) was collected for 2023, stratified by rank, gender, and race/ethnicity. Results: The AAMC Faculty Salary Survey data for 2023 included responses for 683 IR (138 women, 545 men) and 2431 DR (862 women, 1569 men) faculty. Men had a higher median compensation than women at all ranks, for both IR and DR, except DR instructors. The gender pay gap was greater in IR faculty compared to DR faculty of the same rank. All intersectional groups among IR faculty reported a lower median compensation compared to White men of the same rank. All intersectional groups among DR faculty, except Asian Men, had a lower median compensation than White men of the same rank. Among IR faculty, Asian women assistant professors faced the greatest disparity in median compensation, down to $75 K (15%) lower than White men. Among DR faculty, Black/African American women assistant professors faced the greatest disparity on median compensation, down to $48 K (10.5%) lower than White men. Conclusion: The study results raise important concerns about impact of intersectionality on faculty compensation in radiology which needs further study and should be addressed as part of broader drive to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic radiology.

Total fee-for-service Medicare payments and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System procedure codes for all fee-for-service beneficiaries were aggregated according to physician gender, specialty, years since medical school graduation, and type of service classifications.Results: Excluding drug reimbursement, the mean total Medicare payments per female physician, compared with those for male physicians, were 41% in surgical specialties, 72% in hospital-based specialties, and 55% across all specialties (P<.001). The mean overall number of unique beneficiary visits per female physician was 59% of that for male physicians (P<.001).

Deferred Personal Life Decisions of Women Physicians,"Bering, J; Pflibsen, L; Eno, C; Radhakrishnan, P","Objective: Inadequate work-life balance can have significant implications regarding individual performance, retention, and on the future of the workforce in medicine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether women physicians defer personal life decisions in pursuit of their medical career. Materials and Methods: We conducted a survey study of women physicians ages 20-80 from various medical specialties using a combination of social media platforms and women physicians' professional listservs with 801 survey responses collected from May through November 2015. The primary endpoint was whether women physicians deferred personal life decisions in pursuit of their medical career. Secondary outcomes include types of decisions deferred and correlations with age, hours worked per week, specialty, number of children, and career satisfaction. Results: Respondents were categorized into deferred and nondeferred groups. Personal decision deferments were reported by 64% of respondents. Of these, 86% reported waiting to have children and 22% reported waiting to get married. Finally, while 85% of women in the nondeferment group would choose medicine again as a career, only 71% of women in the deferment group would do so (p<0.0001). Physicians who would choose medicine again cited reasons such as career satisfaction, positive patient interactions, and intellectual stimulation, whereas those who would not choose medicine again reported poor work-life balance, decreasing job satisfaction, and insurance/administrative burden. Conclusions: The results of this survey have significant implications on the future of the workforce in medicine. Overall, our analysis shows that 64% of women physicians defer important life decisions in pursuit of their medical career.

We identified three themes: (1) people (how and who): women seek out and receive sponsorship differently; (2) process (faster and further): sponsorship provides an extra boost, especially for women; and (3) politics and culture (playing favorites and paying it forward): sponsorship and fairness. Informants acknowledge that sponsorship provides an extra boost for career advancement especially for women. Sponsors and proteges differ in their perceptions of how sponsorship happens. Informants describe gender differences in how sponsorship is experienced and specifically noted that women were less likely to actively seek out sponsorship and be identified as proteges compared to men. Informants describe a tension between sponsorship and core academic values such as transparency, fairness, and merit.

Workforce Characterisustics of Early Career Neonatologists and Comparison of Practice Sites,"Nestander, M; Day, C; Lucke, A; Gautam, S; Horowitz, E; Bernstein, SM; Bhatia, A","Objective Transitioning into the early career physician workforce is a uniquely challenging period in a neonatologist's career. There are limited educational opportunities in fellowship regarding career progression, practice models, and benefits. Understanding these factors are key when searching for employment. This study evaluates the early career neonatologist (ECN) workforce and employment characteristics to improve identification of professional needs.Study Design An anonymous 59-question cross-sectional survey was distributed in July 2020 to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine Trainees and Early Career Neonatologists (TECaN). The survey instrument was designed using Survey-Monkey and assessed search methods for identifying employers, employment contract details, and professional duties. Questions addressed clinical service time, level of acuity, protected research time, financial compensation, benefits, job search methods, and promotion requirements. Comparisons were drawn between respondents exclusively working in a university-based setting and respondents employed in nonuniversity locations. Responses were collected using Survey-Monkey and then extracted to a Microsoft Excel Workbook for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4.Results Of 1,302 eligible members, 348 people responded (26.7%). Forty-six percent of respondents worked in a university setting and 54% worked in a nonuniversity setting. Using employment site as a discriminator, significant differences were noted in scheduling models. University-located respondents were more likely to work 2-week block schedules, fewer weekend/weeknight call, less clinical weeks per year, and more research/ administrative weeks per year. Between university and nonuniversity located positions, benefits were largely comparable, while factors perceived as influential toward promotion varied depending on practice site.Conclusion This study provides ECNs with a contemporary workforce description vital to graduating TECaN seeking employment or renegotiating professional obligations.

"The occurrence of demotions regarding job level, salary and job authority","Verheyen, T; Deschacht, N; Guerry, MA","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the occurrence of job level, salary and job authority demotions in the workplace through the analysis of Belgian Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC)-data of 2007-2011.Design/methodology/approach - Three hypotheses are tested: H1: there is a gender inequality in job authority demotions. H2: the level of education and the probability of being subject to a job level, salary or job authority demotion are negatively correlated. H3: age is negatively correlated with job level, salary or job authority demotion probabilities. The cross-sectional data of the SILC cover a specific time period with data on inter alia living conditions. The longitudinal data give information on inter alia income and non-monetary variables over a period of four years. The authors estimate multivariate regression models for binary demotion variables. These analyses allow the authors to estimate the odds of being demoted. The authors discuss the demotion rates, the bivariate correlations and the regression analysis.Findings - The data analysis result in the fact that base salary demotions are not commonly applied as literature and the Belgian law on salary protection endorses. Fringe benefits demotions, as for instance the abolition of a company car or a bonus are, however, more frequent. There is a gender gap with regard to job authority demotion. Highly educated respondents are less confronted with job authority demotions. Age is negatively correlated with base salary/fringe benefits or job authority demotion probabilities, but not with job-level demotions. H1 is thus confirmed. H2 and H3 only partly confirmed.Research limitations/implications - Several analyses were restricted because the EU-SILC did not question all dimensions of demotion in detail.Originality/value - This study contributes to the scarce literature on demotion and to empirical studies on demotions regarding job level, salary and job authority.",2016,,PERSONNEL REVIEW,45,6,1217-1239,WOS:000386218600006,10.1108/PR-06-2014-0139,,#581,Verheyen 2016,"",""
"The Reversal of the Gender Gap in Education, Motherhood, and Women as Main Earners in Europe","Klesment, M; Van Bavel, J","Men have historically attained more education than women, but this gender imbalance in education has reversed in many countries. In recent cohorts, the wife typically has as much as or more education than the husband. Using data from the European Union's Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (N = 95,389 for 27 countries), this article investigates to what extent the newly emerging pattern of educational assortative mating is associated with a higher proportion of women who out-earn their partners in Europe. We find that this proportion varies on the country level between 20 per cent and almost 50 per cent for childless women and is generally much lower for women with small children. However, if a woman is better educated than her partner, this clearly increases the odds that she earns more than half of the couple's joint earnings. This happens to such an extent that it reduces the effect of motherhood on the wife's relative earnings: college-educated mothers of school-age children with less educated partners are nearly as likely to be main breadwinners as college-educated childless women in a homogamous union.",2017,,EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,33,3,465-481,WOS:000404448700010,10.1093/esr/jcw063,,#582,Klesment 2017,"",""
What Women Need: a Study of Institutional Factors and Women Faculty's Intent to Remain in Academic Medicine,"Onumah, C; Wikstrom, S; Valencia, V; Cioletti, A","Background A longstanding gender gap exists in the retention of women in academic medicine. Several strategies have been suggested to promote the retention of women, but there are limited data on impacts of interventions. Objective To identify what institutional factors, if any, impact women faculty's intent to remain in academic medicine, either at their institutions or elsewhere. Design A survey was designed to evaluate institutional retention-linked factors, programs and interventions, their impact, and women's intent to remain at their institutions and within academic medicine. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics and regression analyses. Participants Women with faculty appointments within departments of medicine recruited from national organizations and specific social media groups. Main Measures Institutional factors that may be associated with women's decision to remain at their current institutions or within academic medicine. Key Results Of 410 surveys of women at institutions across the USA, fair and transparent family leave policies and opportunities for work-life integration showed strong associations with intent to remain at one's institution (leave policies: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.20-4.18, p = 0.01; work-life: OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.50-9.64, p < 0.001) and within academic medicine (leave policies: OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.09-5.03, p = 0.03; work-life: OR 4.66, 95% CI 2.04-11.36, p < 0.001). Other institutional factors associated with intent to remain in academics include peer mentorship (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.56-6.57, p < 0.01) and women role models (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.68, p = 0.04). Institutions helping employees recognize bias, fair compensation and provision of resources, satisfaction with mentorship, peer mentorship, and women role models within the institutions were associated with intent to remain at an institution.

With an increase in the emergency medicine (EM) workforce since, we aimed to 1) describe the current status of academic EM workforce by gender, race, and rank and 2) evaluate if disparities still exist in salary or rank by gender.Methods: Information on demographics, rank, clinical commitment, and base and total annual salary for full-time faculty members in U.S. academic emergency departments were collected in 2015 via the Academy of Administrators in Academic Emergency Medicine (AAAEM) Salary Survey. Multiple linear regression was used to compare salary by gender while controlling for confounders.Results: Response rate was 47% (47/101), yielding data on 1,371 full-time faculty: 33% women, 78% white, 4% black, 5% Asian, 3% Asian Indian, 4% other, and 7% unknown race. Comparing white race to nonwhite, 62% versus 69% were instructor/assistant, 23% versus 20% were associate, and 15% versus 10% were full professors. Comparing women to men, 74% versus 59% were instructor/assistant, 19% versus 24% were associate, and 7% versus 17% were full professors. Of 113 chair/vice-chair positions, only 15% were women, and 18% were nonwhite. Women were more often fellowship trained (37% vs. 31%), less often core faculty (59% vs. 64%), with fewer administrative roles (47% vs. 57%; all p < 0.05) but worked similar clinical hours (mean +/- SD = 1,069 +/- 371 hours vs. 1,051 +/- 393 hours). Mean overall salary was $278,631 (SD +/- $68,003).

"CLOSING DIVERSITY GAPS IN INNOVATION: GENDER, RACE, AND INCOME DISPARITIES IN PATENTING AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INVENTIONS","Fechner, H; Shapanka, MS","Women, people of color, and lower-income individuals patent inventions at significantly lower rates than their male, white, and wealthier counterparts. Fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. patents today list a woman as an inventor. Among college graduates, fewer than half as many African Americans and Hispanics hold patents, compared to their white counterparts. Moreover, a child born in the U.S. to a family living below the median income level is ten times less likely to receive a patent in his or her lifetime than a child born to a family in the top one percent of income.These disparities hold back economic growth and U.S. leadership in innovation. Achieving greater gender, race, and income diversity in inventing and patenting would unlock a wealth of innovation, economic growth, and job creation that is now untapped, bringing new inventors, new ideas, and new technologies into the innovation pipeline.The U.S. government, educational institutions, and private industry should adopt measures to promote broad participation in invention and patenting to ensure that women, people of color, and lower-income individuals can contribute equally to the innovation economy. U.S. public policy and private practice should reflect the imperative that broad participation in inventing and patenting drives continued U.S. leadership in the global innovation economy and promotes fundamental fairness.

Participants Ophthalmologists participating in the Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists workforce survey, and/or Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey, and those who made claims from Medicare Benefits Schedule Australia. Methods Combined analysis of de-identified 2014 data from the surveys and Medicare Benefits Schedule. Main Outcome Measures Hours worked, service provision, remuneration and social circumstances. Results Female ophthalmologists provided 35% fewer services per ophthalmologist per year (2834 vs 4328) than male ophthalmologists. Female ophthalmologists received approximately half the annual income of male ophthalmologists; median self-reported net personal annual income was AUD122 500 (interquartile range [IQR] 96 000-225 000) for females compared to AUD245 000 (IQR 180 000-365 000) for males (P = .01).

A larger proportion of the physicians in this study worked in private practice (57.6%) compared with an academic setting (42.4%). Orthopaedic surgeons who subspecialize in sports medicine had significantly higher total mean payment amounts when compared with all other specialties. The primary method of compensation was found to be through licensing or royalty payments.Conclusions:The large majority of orthopaedic surgeons who are highly compensated from industry are men. Among these, the greatest number specialize in the spine, while sports medicine surgeons receive significantly higher total mean payment amounts.

Disparate Impact? Career Disruptions and COVID-19 Impact Statements in Tenure Evaluations,"Rivera, LA; Weisshaar, K; Tilcsik, A","Extensive research reveals employer biases against workers with career disruptions, particularly those related to caregiving. However, the effectiveness of organizational practices intended to mitigate such biases is less well understood. This study examines the use of COVID19 impact statements in tenure decisions at research universities, an organizational intervention that was designed to reduce biases but raised concerns that it might inadvertently amplify them. Contrary to concerns about unintended consequences, a pre-registered survey experiment with 602 full professors in STEM fields reveals that the inclusion of impact statements leads to more favorable tenure evaluations, regardless of faculty gender and disruption type. Qualitative evidence suggests that perceptions of pandemic-related disruptions as legitimate, externally imposed, timelimited events in the past help circumvent previously documented biases. This study enhances our understanding of organizational practices that effectively mitigate biases and points to the potential role of narrative framing in workplace evaluations and organizational inequalities.",2024,,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,11,,626-648,WOS:001297378100001,10.15195/v1.a23,,#601,Rivera 2024,"",""
Perceived abilities or academic interests? Longitudinal high school science and mathematics effects on postsecondary STEM outcomes by gender and race,"Zhao, T; Perez-Felkner, L","Purpose of the study Previous literature has examined the relationship between high school students' postsecondary STEM major choices and their prior interest and perceived ability in mathematics. Yet, we have limited understanding of whether and how perceived ability and interest in science and mathematics jointly affect students' STEM major choices. Results Using the most recent nationally representative longitudinal cohort of U.S. secondary school students, we examine the degree to which students' perceived mathematical and scientific abilities and interests predict their STEM major choices, employing logistic regression and a series of interaction analyses. We find that while both mathematics and science perceived ability positively influence STEM major selection, academic interest in these subjects is a weaker predictor. Moreover, across a series of analyses, we observe a significant gender gap-whereby women are less than half as likely to select STEM majors-as well as nuanced distinctions by self-identified race. The relationships among perceived ability, interest, and STEM major choice are not found to meaningfully vary by race nor consistently by gender. However, perceived ability has a more positive effect for men than women who are pursuing Computing/Engineering majors and a more positive effect for women than men who are pursuing other STEM majors, including less applied Social/Behavioral, Natural, and Other Sciences. Implications These findings suggest potential opportunities to enhance their perceived mathematical and scientific abilities in high school, positioning them to potentially enter STEM fields. School sites with more resources to support the ambitions of STEM students of all backgrounds may be better positioned to reduce postsecondary disparities in STEM fields. Given existing opportunity gaps and resource differentials among schools, corresponding recommendations are suggested.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,9,1,,WOS:000814627600001,10.1186/s40594-022-00356-w,,#603,Zhao 2022,"",""

The study reveals that students from marginalised social groups experience significantly lower placement rates and exhibit substantially lower academic performance. Even after accounting for academic differences, marginalised community students are less likely to be employed, signalling labour market bias. Males within this marginalised group face even lower placement chances. When employed, marginalised group students are less likely to be employed in high-paying jobs.

We investigate the impact of eHealth literacy on reducing loneliness and sustaining well-being during the pandemic, comparing middle- and high-income countries.Research Design and Methods Online surveys were conducted between April 4, 2020, and September 30, 2021, collecting responses (N = 2,091) from medium- and high-income countries in Europe, Asia, and North America. T-tests and ANOVAs were used to test how sociodemographic predictors were associated with differences in e-Health literacy, loneliness, and well-being.Results Respondents from high-income countries reported significantly higher well-being scores than those from middle-income countries and respondents from high-income countries had significantly higher e-HEALS (e-Health literacy) scores compared to middle-income countries. No significant difference was observed in loneliness scores between high-income and middle-income country respondents. Well-being is associated with age, with younger adults (18-29 years) and those aged 40+ reporting higher levels. Higher education and income are linked to greater well-being. Gender differences are observed, with females and those with a partner reporting higher well-being. In middle-income countries, higher education levels are more linked to loneliness, while in higher-income countries, loneliness is observed across education levels.Discussion and Implications Future interventions by governments and policymakers should consider intersectionality in e-Health planning and offer digital literacy and digital skills training to those with lower education levels.",2025,,GERONTOLOGIST,65,1,,WOS:001391887500001,10.1093/geront/gnae170,,#606,Ivan 2025,"",""

Our identification strategy exploits the fact that many instructors, in addition to traditional teaching in the classroom, also teach in the online environment, where attractiveness is either unknown or less salient. We utilize multiple attractiveness measures, including facial symmetry software, subjective evaluations, and a novel, proxy methodology that resembles a ""Keynesian Beauty Contest."" We identify a substantial beauty premium in face-to-face classes for women but not for men.

"If the Government Pays for Full Home-Charger Installation, Would Affordable-Housing and Middle-Income Residents Buy Electric Vehicles?","Lusk, AC; Li, X; Liu, QM","With climate change and inequities, this study assessed the willingness of affordable-housing and middle-income residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV) if they had a charging station at their home, the likelihood of buying an EV in 2 years, ideal charger locations, and payment preferences for installation. The new Green Books revealed charger opportunities. Volunteers completed paper surveys in Brookline, MA, in an affordable housing complex (n = 37) and a middle-income neighborhood (n = 128) (Total n = 165). Brookline is unique because drivers cannot leave their cars curbside overnight, and local historic districts (LHDs) require aesthetic charger-installations. Descriptive statistics (yes + likely) revealed that affordable housing (70%) and middle-income (65%) respondents would lease or buy a secondhand EV if they had a charging station where they park their car at their home. Affordable housing (43%) and middle-income (38%) respondents were more neutral about buying an EV in the next 2 years. The preferred charger location was the side of the house (44%) or a post by the driveway (38%). Preferred cost-for-installation included government reimbursement (47%) and tax deduction (41%). Data analysis combined affordable housing and middle-income responses and showed no significant differences for gender, significant differences for individuals 76 years and older, and minor differences for income. To inform individuals in the pre-contemplation phase, Black-owned businesses in the new Green Books could seek government funding for off-road chargers. While EV technology will improve, land is limited, so chargers should not displace climate-responsive bicyclists in curbside protected bike lanes.

DIGITAL PIRACY AND THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR: DEVELOPING TYPOLOGY OF CONSUMERS,"Piri Rajh, S; Rajh, E; Horvat, S","The aim of this research was to develop a typology of consumers in the context of digital piracy. Typology is based on the variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework: attitudes toward behavior, subjective norm, personal norm, perceived behavior control, and behavioral intention. The TPB is a theoretical framework widely used in explaining human behavior in different settings, and one of them is related to digital piracy.Digital piracy represents a set of illegal activities referring to downloading, copying, sharing, selling, and using of copyrighted digital goods, meaning that no permission from the copyright holders has been requested, nor any compensation has been given to them. The importance of understanding digital piracy stems from its significant share in the global economy and the high financial losses imposed on all stakeholders involved in the digital economy.The measurement instrument used in the research process was a highly-structured questionnaire that included scales borrowed from the relevant literature and adapted to the digital piracy context. The research was based on an online survey approach in order to ensure full anonymity of the respondents due to the sensitivity of the research topic. A convenience sampling procedure for data collection was applied, by using university students as a target sample since past research studies suggest that digital piracy behavior occurs especially among young people. The sample consisted of 302 respondents. Their participation in the research study was voluntary. K-means cluster analysis was conducted in order to develop a typology of consumers. In addition, a Chi-square test was conducted to examine gender differences among the clusters. This research study has identified two groups of consumers who differ in their digital piracy behavioral intention determined by the observed TPB variables. In addition, this study has revealed that gender differences among clusters also explain respondents' behavioral intention to engage in the observed type of behavior.This paper will contribute to the literature by exploring the possibility of application of the Theory of Planned Behavior as a basis for developing the typology of consumers in the specific context of digital piracy behavior.

Double majoring is common at about 20% of college graduates, yet most double majors are in related areas that provide limited educational diversity. We examine private and social benefits of double majoring using data from the 2010 National Survey of College Graduates. The strongest positive relations associated with combining a liberal arts major with a business or STEM major are on research and development activities and on job match. In addition, we find that students who double major in business and STEM earn a premium over those single majors.

Economic statistics as political artefacts,"Mügge, D","Macroeconomic statistics simultaneously shape and try to capture the political economy we study. Their biases mold social and political dynamics; they also infect academic and policy analysis. Political economy can both benefit from and advance an understanding of economic statistics as political artefacts. To help unlock that potential, this article builds on scholarship dispersed across disciplines and highlights three points. First, a binary debate that either acclaims or vilifies economic data is misdirected. Indispensable for public policy, quantification is neither good nor bad per se; the question is what its specific ramifications are. Second, macroeconomic statistics have been built around an ideal of white male factory work for wages. The further economic activity is removed from that image, the more statistics misrepresent or ignore it, with systematic biases as a result. Third, the real-world impact of statistics always depends on how they are understood, used, and subverted. It hinges on statisticalpractices, not just on abstract measurement approaches.

"Less money, less children, and less prestige: Differences between male and female academic librarians","Eva, N; Lê, ML; Sheriff, J","Academic librarianship is a heavily feminized profession, with women making up between 72 and 74% of the workforce based on statistics from Canada and the US (American Library Association, 2012; Canadian Association of University Teachers, 2017).

The authors analyzed linked data from a 2018 census of academic librarians to uncover and examine the experience of motherhood and librarianship, specifically by looking at potential connections between gender, salary, number of dependents, and academic rank. Results demonstrate that women earn, on average, $10,000CDN/year less, are less likely to become a parent as their career progresses, and are overly represented at the lower ranks (e.g., Assistant Librarian) than their men counterparts.

"The dragon cohort of Hong Kong: traditional beliefs, demographics, and education","Lau, Y","In Hong Kong, parental preference for babies born in the Chinese Zodiac dragon year causes spikes in fertility. The larger number of dragon babies born in 1988 resulted in a schooling cohort which was 5% larger on average every school-year. Using an innovative identification strategy that avoids selection bias, I find that dragon cohort students increase their time spent studying math by an average of 0.26 hours per week (a 9% increase relative to the mean). These effort responses are strongest for girls and for students whose parents do not have post-secondary education. Being in the dragon cohort also results in higher math scores. These empirical findings are consistent with competitive behavior changes of dragon cohort members responding to the presence of additional students. I cannot, however, rule out other possible mechanisms, such as cooperation, peer quality, and educational investments, acting in conjunction to improve academic outcomes. This paper is the first to document the test score and effort impacts of such zodiac cohorts; its findings highlight the importance of cultural forces in determining population changes, and their potential to influence education and other societal outcomes.",2019,,JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS,32,1,219-246,WOS:000451765100007,10.1007/s00148-018-0711-2,,#624,Lau 2019,"",""

"The Conscientiousness x Interest Compensation (CONIC) Model: Generalizability Across Domains, Outcomes, and Predictors","Song, J; Gaspard, H; Nagengast, B; Trautwein, U","Conscientiousness and interest are well-known predictors of academic effort and achievement. As hypothesized by the Conscientiousness x Interest Compensation (CONIC) model, conscientiousness and interest can (partly) compensate for each other, leading to (comparatively) high effort if either conscientiousness or interest is high. The present research (a) provides a test of this prediction across four school subjects, (b) examines whether the compensatory interaction can also be found when academic achievement is the outcome instead of academic effort, and (c) probes for the compensatory interaction when interest is replaced by utility value as a predictor variable. A total of 830 students in Grades 5 to 12 participated in this study. We assessed their conscientiousness and measured task value beliefs, academic effort, and achievement in 4 school subjects (German. English. mathematics, and biology). The predictions of the CONIC model were supported in all 4 subjects. In addition, we found compensatory interactions between conscientiousness and interest in predicting both academic effort and achievement. Furthermore, we observed similar compensatory interactions between conscientiousness and utility value.

What dictates income in New York City? SHAP analysis of income estimation based on Socio-economic and Spatial Information Gaussian Processes (SSIG),"Bai, RQ; Lam, JCK; Li, VOK","Income inequality presents a key challenge to urban sustainability across the developed economies. Traditionally, accurate high granularity income data are generally obtained from field surveys. However, due to privacy considerations, field subjects are hesitant to provide accurate personal income data. A Socio-economic & Spatial-Information-GP (SSIG) model is thereby developed to estimate district-based high granularity income for New York City (NYC). As compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian Processes (GP) income estimation model based entirely on spatial information, SSIG incorporates socio-economic domain-specific knowledge into a GP model. For SSIG to be explainable, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is undertaken to evaluate the relative contribution of various key individual socio-economic variables to district-based per-capita and median household income in NYC. Differentiating from traditional income inequality studies based predominantly on linear or log-linear regression model, SSIG presents a novel income-based model architecture, capable of modelling complex non-linear relationships. In parallel, SHAP analysis serves an effective analytical tool for identifying the key attributes to income inequality. Results have shown that SSIG surpasses other state-of-the-art baselines in estimation accuracy, as far as per-capita and median household income estimation at the Tract-level and the ZIP-level in NYC are concerned. SHAP results have indicated that having a bachelor or a postgraduate degree can accurately predict income in NYC, despite that between-district income inequality due to Sex/Race remains prevalent. SHAP has further confirmed that between-district income gap is more associated with Race than Sex. Furthermore, ablation study shows that socio-economic information is more predictive of income at the ZIP-level, relative to the spatial information. This study carries significant implications for policy-making in a developed context. To promote urban economic sustainability in NYC, policymakers can attend to the growing income disparity (income inequality) contributed by Sex and Race, while giving more higher education opportunities to residents in the lower-income districts, as the estimated per-capita income is more sensitive to the proportion of adults >= 25 holding a bachelor's degree. Finally, interpretative SHAP analysis is useful for investigating the relative contribution of socio-economic inputs to any predicted outputs in future machine-learning-driven socio-economic analyses.",2023,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,10,1,,WOS:000937168000001,10.1057/s41599-023-01548-7,,#627,Bai 2023,"",""

"Funding Sources, Family Income, and Fields of Study in College","Quadlin, N","Research shows that receiving loans, family contributions, and grants has implications for students both during and after college, but one key outcome has been overlooked: fields of study. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 cohort (NLSY-97), this study is the first to assess how college funding is associated with first-term majors and course selection throughout college. I posit that funding sources effectively constrain students' fields of study, such that students choose majors and courses that align with their broader financial circumstances. As funding from loans increases, students are more likely to major in applied non-STEM fields (e.g., business, nursing) and less likely to be undeclared during the first term-particularly if students are from low-or middle-income families. Conversely, as funding from family contributions increases, students are more likely to be undeclared and less likely to major or take courses in applied non-STEM fields. Receiving grants bears little relation to students' major or course fields. These patterns suggest that funding sources entail distinct costs and benefits that may influence college student decision-making, and that fields of study are the product of multiple sources of inequality.",2017,,SOCIAL FORCES,96,1,91-120,WOS:000409194400021,10.1093/sf/sox042,,#629,Quadlin 2017,"",""

A Vision for Postmaternalism: Institutionalising Fathers' Engagement with Care,"Yamashita, J","Social policy development under neo-liberal logic glorifies paid work in the market over relationships involving care, nurture and dependency. Under neo-liberal conditions, the social policy framework in a large number of welfare states has moved towards the norm of the adult worker model. The prevalence of this model, which signalled a 'farewell to maternalism', has had the consequence that supporting mothers' care-giving roles are dismissed in state policy-making. Such neo-liberal logic leads to the creation of an apparent cultural anxiety about caregiving and nurturing. Julie Stephens [2011. Confronting Postmaternal Thinking: Feminism, Memory and Care. New York: Columbia University Press] calls this 'postmaternal' thinking. Drawing on feminist critiques of neo-liberal developments in social policy, this article provides a divergent and even slightly positive interpretation of postmaternalism that does not abandon care and nurture. This is evident in the recent development of parental leave policies that institutionally encourage men to become involved with caring. I argue that a 'farewell to maternalism' in social policy is therefore not too problematic. Parental leave policy - particularly with institutionalised incentives for men to take up parental leave - is creating a transformative space for men to experience the maternal thinking that confronts the cultural logic of what Stephens conceptualises as postmaternal thinking.",2016,,AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES,31,90,432-447,WOS:000398208300004,10.1080/08164649.2016.1278157,,#631,Yamashita 2016,"",""
"The association between graduates' field of study and occupational attainment in West Germany, 1980-2008","Klein, M","Over the course of higher education expansion and growing numbers of graduates, employers are supposed to have increasing difficulties to regard a higher education degree as reliable signal for productivity. As a consequence, they may take into account 'qualitative' differences such as graduates' field of study more often than in previous times when hiring labour market entrants. Both from a supply-and demand-side perspective graduates from humanities, social services or arts may be increasingly disadvantaged in terms of labour market outcomes compared to graduates from science, technology, engineering and mathematics over time. The article tests this argumentation by assessing changes in the relationship between graduates' field of study and risk of unemployment as well as access to the service class in West Germany between 1980 and 2008. Changes in returns to field of study may contribute to growing (social) inequalities among graduates amidst educational expansion and are therefore important to consider. Based on Microcensus data, the results show that field of study differences in terms of both labour market outcomes did not increasingly diverge over time.

Currently, participation in engineering education among the educated classes is decreasing. According to the theory of human capital, the rate of return to education influences individual educational choices and student resources available at colleges and universities. Based on responses to the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2003, 2008), descriptive statistics were used to explore the rate of return to higher engineering education in China, and models were developed to estimate the rates of return to education across different disciplines. Results revealed that the rate of return to higher engineering education in China in 2003 was 10.6%, whereas it was 14.7% in 2008. A ranking of the rates of return across higher education disciplines in China revealed that engineering was in an intermediate position, ranking 7th in 2003 and 6th in 2008. Gender differences were evident in the rates of return to engineering education in China, with high rates for males and low rates for females.

Improving PHC services require understanding context-specific factors influencing utilisation. We assessed the factors influencing utilisation of PHC services in a rural community in Enugu, Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional community-based survey between May and June, 2017. Information on socio-demographic characteristics, utilisation of PHC services, community-and PHC facility-related factors associated with utilisation of PHC services was obtained from 335 adult residents aged ??? 18 years using a pre-tested semi-structured interviewer -administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics at 5% level of significance. Results: of the 335 respondents, 155 (46.2%) reported utilisation of PHC services the last time they were sick. Of 178 respondents who did not utilise PHC services, 51 (28.7%) reported poor quality health services, 41 (23.0%) unavailability of medical doctors, 31 (17.4%) long patient waiting time and 25 (14.0%) unavailability of drugs as reasons for non -utilisation.

Gender and entrepreneurial intention in low-income countries: the relative roles played by anticipated financial returns versus perceived barriers for university students in Sierra Leone,"Bradley, WA; Fry, C","PurposeThe purpose of the present study is to investigate the extent to which female and male university students from low-income countries express different entrepreneurial intentions. Specifically, the study empirically tests whether the anticipated financial returns to entrepreneurship versus salaried employment, or the perceived barriers to entrepreneurship exert a stronger influence on the relationship between gender and entrepreneurial intentions.Design/methodology/approachTo test the relationship of anticipated rewards versus barriers to entrepreneurship on gender and entrepreneurial intention, the study uses new data from a field survey in Sierra Leone and employs multiple mediation analyses.FindingsThe authors find that the relationship between gender and entrepreneurial intentions operates through the mediator of perceptions of the financial returns to entrepreneurship but not perceived barriers to entrepreneurship.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors study intent, not behavior, acknowledging that cognitive intent is a powerful predictor of later behavior. Implications for future research on entrepreneurship in the African context are discussed.Practical implicationsThe results from this study can be applied to both pedagogic and business settings in the field of entrepreneurship, with concrete implications for policymakers.Originality/valueResults suggest that the gender gap in entrepreneurial intentions (EI) for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)- and business-educated students in Sierra Leone is predominantly influenced by anticipated financial returns to occupational choices, as opposed to perceived barriers to entrepreneurship, a more frequently studied antecedent to EI.",2024,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH,30,7,1750-1778,WOS:001162645500001,10.1108/IJEBR-11-2022-0980,,#646,Bradley 2024,"",""
"The role of education, occupational match on job satisfaction in the behavioral and social science workforce","Hur, H; Maurer, JA; Hawley, J","While many studies that have been conducted in recent years examining the education and workforce outcomes of STEM graduates, few have focused on the behavioral and social sciences (BSS). Federal agencies, such as National Institutes of Health (NIH), are implementing policies to foster multidisciplinary research in an effort to find more effective solutions to complex problems. As a result, there is growing interest in the career pathways of BSS scientists. This study seeks to increase our understanding of how BSS graduates, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, transition to employment within their respective fields. The focus of this research is the impact of horizontal mismatch, defined as the misalignment between a worker's degree and occupational fields, on job satisfaction and wage outcomes. This analysis of returns to education when mismatch occurs, including a comparison among majors and various demographic groups, provides insights into the labor market experiences of these scientists. Mismatched graduates were found to be much more vulnerable, earning less, and having lower job satisfaction, than their counterparts employed in jobs that aligned with their field of study. Additional job-related training was found to have a positive influence on these outcomes. Also of interest in this study were variations in wage penalties and job satisfaction between groups having different gender and race diversity characteristics. These findings are useful to human resource development (HRD) professionals, governmental policymakers, and other stakeholders seeking strategies to improve the workforce outcomes of BSS scientists.",2019,,HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY,30,3,407-435,WOS:000486054700007,10.1002/hrdq.21343,,#647,Hur 2019,"",""

Furthermore, 33% of students matching in urology are now female. In this analysis we characterize the female workforce in urology compared to that of men with regard to income, workload and job satisfaction.Materials and Methods: We collaborated with the American Urological Association to survey its domestic membership of practicing urologists regarding socioeconomic, workforce and quality of life issues. A total of 6,511 survey invitations were sent via e-mail. The survey consisted of 26 questions and took approximately 13 minutes to complete. Linear regression models were used to evaluate bivariable and multivariable associations with job satisfaction and compensation.Results: A total of 848 responses (660 or 90% male, 73 or 10% female) were collected for a total response rate of 13%. On bivariable analysis female urologists were younger (p < 0.0001), more likely to be fellowship trained (p = 0.002), worked in academics (p = 0.008), were less likely to be self-employed and worked fewer hours (p = 0.03) compared to male urologists. On multivariable analysis female gender was a significant predictor of lower compensation (p = 0.001) when controlling for work hours, call frequency, age, practice setting and type, fellowship training and advance practice provider employment. Adjusted salaries among female urologists were $76,321 less than those of men.

Self-Regulation in Childhood as a Predictor of Future Outcomes: A Meta-Analytic Review,"Robson, DA; Allen, MS; Howard, SJ","This meta-analysis explores whether self-regulation in childhood relates to concurrent and subsequent levels of achievement, interpersonal behaviors, mental health, and healthy living. A comprehensive literature search identified 150 studies that met inclusion criteria (745 effect sizes; total n = 215,212). Data were analyzed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Mean effect sizes from 55 meta-analyses provided evidence that self-regulation relates to 25 discrete outcomes. Results showed that self-regulation in preschool (similar to age 4) was positively associated with social competency, school engagement, and academic performance, and negatively associated with internalizing problems, peer victimization, and externalizing problems, in early school years (similar to age 8). Self-regulation in early school years was positively related to academic achievement (math and literacy), and negatively related to externalizing problems (aggressive and criminal behavior), depressive symptoms, obesity, cigarette smoking and illicit drug use, in later school years (similar to age 13). Results also showed that self-regulation in early school years was negatively related to unemployment, aggressive and criminal behavior, depression and anxiety, obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, and symptoms of physical illness in adulthood (similar to age 38). Random effects metaregression identified self-regulation measurement as the most important moderator of pooled mean effects, with task-based assessments and teacher-report assessments often showing stronger associations than parent-report assessments.

We use machine learning to measure partisanship in academic economics articles. We predict the observed political behaviour of a subset of economists using phrases from their academic articles, show good out-of-sample predictive accuracy and then predict partisanship for all economists. We then use these predictions to examine patterns of political language in economics. We estimate journal-specific effects on predicted ideology, controlling for author and year fixed effects, that accord with existing survey-based measures. We show considerable sorting of economists into fields of research by predicted partisanship. We also show that partisanship is detectable even within fields, even across those estimating the same theoretical parameter. Using policy-relevant parameters collected from previous meta-analyses, we then show that imputed partisanship is correlated with estimated parameters, such that the implied policy prescription is consistent with partisan leaning.

Innovation and wage inequalities: Evidence from Brazilian regions,"de Oliveira, BV; Goncalves, E; Taveira, JG","Innovation can lead to wage inequalities through different channels. This paper explores this relationship, focusing on the direct and spillover (indirect) effects of these channels on personal wage inequalities in Brazilian regions. Product and process innovation are measured by patents and the acquisition of foreign technology through imports of capital goods respectively. Based on data that covers 482 regions from 2003 to 2014, we use the Spatial Durbin Model with spatial fixed effects to control spatial dependence and heterogeneity across regions. The results point to a positive association between our measures of innovation and wage inequalities. However, as we found a non-linear relationship between imports of capital goods and wage inequality, an increase in imports of capital goods may reduce wage inequality. Other variables may also cause inequality to fall, such as the share of the population with a higher education degree and social skills. Drivers behind an increase in inequality are female participation in the workforce and the level of GDP per capita.",2024,,GROWTH AND CHANGE,55,3,,WOS:001270222300001,10.1111/grow.12733,,#652,deOliveira 2024,"",""

However, this relationship only holds true for male surgeons and female internal medicine doctors, not for female surgeons or male internal medicine doctors. These findings suggest the possible presence of gender-specialty bias in the influence of facial attractiveness on patients' decision-making. To further investigate how facial attractiveness influences users' inclination to choose a particular doctor, we develop our research model drawing upon the stereotype content and social role perspective.

How Gender Segregation in Higher Education Contributes to Gender Segregation in the US Labor Market,"Zheng, HW; Weeden, KA","What is the rela tion ship between gen der seg re ga tion in higher edu ca tion and gen der seg re ga tion in the labor mar ket? Using Fossett's (2017) difference-of-means method for calculating segregation indices and data from the American Community Survey, we show that approx i ma tely 36% of occu pa tional seg re ga tion among col lege-educated workers is associated with gender segregation across 173 fields of study, and roughly 64% reflects gender segregation within fields. A decomposition analysis shows that fields contribute to occupational segregation mainly through endowment effects (men's and women's uneven distribution across fields) than through the coefficient effects (gender differences in the likelihood of entering a male-dominated occupation from the same field). Endowment effects are highest in fields strongly linked to the labor market, suggesting that educational segregation among fields in which graduates tend to enter a lim ited set of occu pa tions is par tic u larly con se quen tial for occu pa tional segregation. Within-field occupational segregation is higher among heavily male -dominated fields than other fields, but it does not vary systematically by fields' STEM status or field-occupation linkage strength. Assuming the relationship between field seg re ga tion and occu pa tional seg re ga tion is at least partly causal, these results imply that integrating higher education (e.g., by increasing women's representation in STEM majors) will reduce but not eliminate gender segregation in labor markets.",2023,,DEMOGRAPHY,60,3,761-784,WOS:001018924700006,10.1215/00703370-10653728,,#655,Zheng 2023,"",""

When some individuals in the work force of today were children, what kinds of expectations did they have for themselves? What expectations did their parents have for them? Did these expectations vary for girls and boys? Were parents' expectations about their children's future education related to the actual education that these adolescents later attained in midlife? How did the child's academic ability and characteristics of the family figure into this picture?

In line with the expectancy-value model of motivation, the family's socioeconomic status (SES) was identified as an important predictor of several outcomes. Consistent with the model, for both genders, the family's SES and parental educational expectations in middle adolescence predicted middle adult educational attainment. The importance of grades differed by gender in that the mathematics grade was a statistically significant predictor of middle adult educational attainment for males, while for females grades in Swedish were a statistically significant predictor of middle adult educational attainment.

Evaluating the Role of Self-Esteem on Differential Career Outcomes by Gender in Academic Medicine,"Manne-Goehler, J; Freund, KM; Raj, A; Kaplan, SE; Terrin, N; Breeze, JL; Carr, PL","Purpose Gender differences in faculty advancement persist in academic medicine. Understanding of what drives these differences remains limited. The relationship among self-esteem, gender, and career outcomes has not previously been explored. Method The authors evaluated the association between gender and 2012-2013 career outcomes, specifically, the number of publications, academic rank, leadership positions, and retention, and whether self-esteem as measured in the 1995 National Faculty Survey mediates this relationship. They measured self-esteem using the modified Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The authors used multivariable logistic regression analysis to understand the association among gender, self-esteem, and the outcomes of rank, leadership, and retention, and negative binomial models for number of publications. Models were adjusted for race, specialty, effort distribution, and years since first faculty appointment. The authors performed a mediation analysis to understand whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between gender and these career outcomes. Results Overall, self-esteem scores were high. Women had lower self-esteem in 1995 than their male colleagues. In adjusted models, female gender was associated with lower performance on all 4 career outcome metrics. While self-esteem scores were positively associated with all 4 outcomes, the authors' mediation analysis suggested that self-esteem did not mediate the relationship between gender and these 4 career metrics. Conclusions Female medical faculty members lag behind men on traditional metrics of faculty achievement. While higher self-esteem is positively associated with faculty achievement, it did not mediate the relationship between gender and career advancement over the 17 years of follow-up and, thus, may not be an ideal target for programs and policies to increase gender parity in academic medicine.",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,10,1558-1562,WOS:000577085000027,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003138,,#661,Manne-Goehler 2020,"",""

Sociodemographic disparities and contextual factors in obesity: updated evidence from a National Survey of Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases,"Pou, SA; Diaz, MD; Velazquez, GA; Aballay, LR","Objective: To assess the association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with the obesity occurrence in Argentina from a sex- and age-comparative perspective and a multilevel approach. Design: Cross-sectional study based on secondary data from the National Survey of Chronic Diseases Risk Factors (CDRF) 2018, Argentina. Two-level logistic regression models stratified by sex and age were used. Setting: The nationwide probabilistic sample of the CDRF survey and twenty-four geographical units. Participants: 16 410 adult people, living in Argentine towns of at least 5000 people, nested into 24 geographical units. Sex and age groups were defined as young (aged 18-44 years), middle-aged (45-64 years) and older (65 years and older) men and women. Results: Single men (all age groups) and divorced/widowed men (aged 45 years or older) had a lower obesity risk compared to married ones. In the middle-aged group, men with higher education showed a lower risk than men with incomplete primary education. In young women, a marked social gradient by educational level was observed. A low-income level coupled with highly urbanised contexts represents an unfavourable scenario for young and middle-aged women. Having a multi-person household was a risk factor for obesity (OR = 1 center dot 26, P = 0 center dot 038) in middle-aged women. Contextual factors linked to the availability of socially constructed recreational resources and green spaces were associated with obesity among young adults. Conclusions: Socio-environmental determinants of obesity seem to operate differently according to sex and age in Argentina.

The Association of Pension Income with the Incidence of Type I Obesity among Retired Israelis,"Arbel, Y; Fialkoff, C; Kerner, A","Previous studies have identified obesity and overweight as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. The objective of the current study is to investigate gender differences and the impact of wealth and income from pensions, sociodemographic variables, and self-assessment of health conditions on the projected probability to become obese in the postretirement age (67years and older). We are unaware of previous studies, which explored the direct relationship between obesity, monetary income from pensions, wealth, and self-assessment of health conditions. To conduct this research, we make use of an extensive questionnaire concerning the economic and sociodemographic features and health and housing conditions of individuals administered within the framework of the 2015-2016 longitudinal survey conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The survey is representative of the Israeli population and also includes information regarding the weight, height, gender, and age of each household member. Results of our study demonstrate that while for the female respondents older than 67, the projected probability of type I obesity (BMI >= 30) drops by 0.41% (p=0.0021) to 0.52% (p=0.0001) with an incremental 10,000 NIS (about $2,500) rise of gross annual income from a pension, for the male respondents above 67years, the projected probability remains unchanged (p=0.4225). This outcome remains robust even when the 2015 BMI measurement of type I obesity (BMI >= 30) is controlled. This drop among women attenuates with a cutoff point increase from BMI >= 25 (overweight) to BMI >= 30 (type I obesity) to BMI >= 35 (type II obesity). Further results indicate that for both genders above 67years and for men above 62years, the projected BMI drop of one year decreases with income from a pension (p=0.013, p=0.039, and p=0.007, respectively), although the spread around the projection becomes wider. Compared with other martial status categories, for widowed females, the projected probability of obesity and self-reporting on improved health conditions drops by 6.58% (p=0.0419) to 11.28% (p=0.0048) and 6.55% (p=0.0190) to 7.47% (p=0.0036), respectively. For females older than 67, family status divorced drops the projected probability of obesity by 9.25% (p=0.0319). For males older than 67, results show a rise in projected obesity with car ownership by 6.10% (p=0.0897) to 6.41% (p=0.0469) and a drop in projected obesity with academic degree status by 9.93% (p=0.0106) to 10.14% (p=0.0118) and immigration status from American-European countries by 7.67% (p=0.0821) to 8.99% (p=0.0398) and Asian-African countries by 11.63% (p=0.0245) to 11.99% (p=0.02).

"Income and wage inequality in democratic Portugal, 1974-2020","Oliveira, C","This paper investigates the evolution of income and wage inequality in Portugal from the 1974 democratic revolution up to 2020, drawing on a series of administrative records, survey data and aggregate statistics. Over this period, Portugal consistently ranked among the most unequal nations in the developed world. The transition from a deeply unequal dictatorial regime, in the wake of the 1974 revolution, brought about substantial redistribution. However, since the 1980s, income and wage inequality followed an arc-shaped trajectory. There was a sharp rise in inequality from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, which, in just eight years, outpaced the infamous US growth in wage inequality of the last five decades. Then, there was stability at high levels until the mid-2000s. Finally, there was a sharp decline in inequality until 2020, which halved both the gender wage gap and the college wage premium. Changes related to the supply and demand for education/skills emerged as key drivers of inequality dynamics. Institutional and political forces were especially relevant in reducing inequality during the transition to democracy and, more recently, with the rising importance of the minimum wage and collective bargaining.",2024,,FISCAL STUDIES,45,3,393-414,WOS:001327168300007,10.1111/1475-5890.12391,,#669,Oliveira 2024,"",""
Willingness to Pay for Elderly Telecare Service Using the Internet and Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting,"Kaga, S; Suzuki, T; Ogasawara, K","Background: In Japan over the past few years, more attention has been focused on unnoticed solitary death in the context of an aging society and the trend toward nuclear family. A number of institutions and companies have implemented a prevention measure with digital terrestrial broadcasting telecare services for the elderly: Hokkaido University; TV-Asahi Corporation; Hitachi, Ltd; Iwamizawa City; Hokkaido Television Broadcasting Co, Ltd; and Hamanasu Information Co, Ltd. Although this system is provided free of charge as a demonstration test, determining the appropriate price for the service is required for its sustainable operation.Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify individual willingness to pay (WTP) so as to test the tenability of digital terrestrial broadcasting service for elderly telecare.Methods: We used the contingent valuation method (CVM) to estimate the WTP for this service among 305 citizens (valid response rate 76.0%) living in Japan. A questionnaire survey was conducted for people aged 18 to 100 years according to Japanese age distribution from September 2016. To elicit WTP, we adopted a double-bound dichotomous choice method to ask the respondents whether they agree or disagree with the price we offered.Results: The median WTP for this service's monthly fee is estimated to be 431 JPY (approximately US $3.7). The finding suggests that gender (0.66, P=.01), health consciousness (1.08, P=.01), willingness to use (2.38, P<.001), and seeing others less than once a week (1.00, P=.06) made a positive effect on WTP.Conclusions: We conclude that reliable WTP was elicited by CVM based on an Internet survey. Calculated median WTP for digital terrestrial broadcasting service for elderly telecare was 431 JPY (approximately US $3.7). In the analysis of factors that affect WTP, constant factors, log-bid, health consciousness, gender, see others less than one time for week, and willingness to use made positive effect to probability of acceptance. In comparison of WTP in different groups, age groups showed that WTP of the elderly group was higher than WTP of the middle age group and younger age group. However, WTP surveys need to be carefully conducted to minimize the sampling bias and allocate accurate structure of gender distribution.",2017,,INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,6,2,,WOS:000415945500014,10.2196/ijmr.7461,,#670,Kaga 2017,"",""

For credibly identifying such persistent effects the analyses should not pick up trends preceding the respective episodes. Against this background, the paper re-examines the famous case of the German division and reunification. The empirical focus is on the persistent mark-up of women in work in East relative to West German regions that are often associated with legacy effects of the socialist regime that was in place in East Germany during the country's four decades of division. In contrast to the conventional wisdom in academia, policy, and the public, the current paper shows that the higher share of working women in East German regions is not due to a legacy of socialism. Female labor force participation was already remarkably higher in the East before the introduction of socialism. The general lesson is that any attempt to explain spatial variation in individual decision-making by persisting institutional and cultural legacies of certain historical episodes needs to assess regional conditions predating these episodes.",2022,,JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,62,4,1048-1091,WOS:000766391700001,10.1111/jors.12589,,#673,Wyrwich 2022,"",""

Policies that promote inclusivity, such as the updated American College of Graduate Medical Education parental leave policy establishing minimum parental leave requirements, may support recruitment to radiation oncology.Methods and Materials: We surveyed 2021-2022 radiation oncology residency applicants and program directors (PDs) about program-specific parental leave policies, transparency of parental leave information during the residency application and interview process, and perceptions of the effect of parenthood on residency training, career advancement, and well-being.Results: Of 89 radiation oncology PDs, 29 (33%) completed the survey. Of 154 residency applicants (current fourth-year medical students, international applicants, or postdoctoral fellows) surveyed, 62 (40%) completed the survey. Most applicants planned to start a family during residency (53%) and reported perceived flexibility to start a family influenced their decision to pursue radiation oncology over other career specialties (55%). Many applicants viewed time in residency (nonresearch, 22%), in research (33%), and as early career faculty (24%) as the best time to start a family. A small number of applicants used program-specific parental leave policy information in determining their rank list (11%), and many applicants sought information regarding fertility health care benefits (55%). Many applicants obtained parental leave information verbally, despite expressing a preference for objective means (slide deck, 63%; website, 50%; or handout, 42%) of information sharing. PDs were all supportive of a 6-week maternity leave policy (100% agree or strongly agree with the policy) and did not feel parental leave would negatively affect a resident's ability to pursue an academic (100%) or private practice career (100%).Conclusions: Many radiation oncology residency applicants plan to start families during training, seek and value program-specific parental leave information and health benefits, and prefer objective means of information sharing.

Despite an increasing proportion of women in research, they are still less likely to have international collaborations. Literature on barriers to knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) between men and women remains limited. This study aimed to assess perceived gender barriers to KTE activities in vaccination-related research in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Methods This was a cross-sectional data assessment from a self-administered questionnaire distributed to researchers in the field of vaccination research. The administered questionnaire was developed and validated by WHO and McMaster University. Descriptive statistics were carried out. Structural factors of KTE were assessed using 12 statements measured with a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An index ranging from 12 to 60 points was created to assess structural factors of KTE, with higher score indicating fewer perceived barriers. Multivariable linear regression modelling was applied to examine the association between KTE barriers and gender. Results A total of 158 researchers were included in the analysis. Regardless of gender and country of affiliation, researchers experienced challenges with respect to KTE activities; particularly factors related to the availability of human and financial resources and level of technical expertise among their target audience. We were also able to identify perceived facilitators among men and women, such as the presence of structures that link researchers and target audiences, the investment of target audiences in KTE efforts and the presence of stable contacts among target audiences. Our linear regression analysis showed that women perceived more barriers than men (R-2 = 0.014; B = -1.069; 95% CI -4.035; 1.897). Conclusions Men and women shared common perspectives on barriers to KTE.

Policies and interventions to remove gender-related barriers to girls' school participation and learning in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review of the evidence,"Psaki, S; Haberland, N; Mensch, B; Woyczynski, L; Chuang, E","Background Gender disparities in education continue to undermine girls' opportunities, despite enormous strides in recent years to improve primary enrolment and attainment for girls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). At the regional, country and subnational levels gender gaps remain, with girls in many settings less likely to complete primary school, less likely to complete secondary, and often less likely to be literate than boys. The academic and policy literatures on the topic of gender-related barriers to girls' education are both extensive. However, there remain gaps in knowledge regarding which interventions are most likely to work in contexts with different combinations of barriers. Objectives This systematic review identified and assessed the strength of the evidence of interventions and exposures addressing gender-related barriers to schooling for girls in LMICs. Search Methods The AEA RCT Registry, Africa Bibliography, African Education Research Database, African Journals Online, DEC USAID, Dissertation Abstracts, EconLit, ELDIS, Evidence Hub, Global Index Medicus, IDEAS-Repec, Intl Clinical Trials Registry, NBER, OpenGrey, Open Knowledge Repository, POPLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, Research for Development Outputs, ScienceDirect, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, as well as relevant organization websites were searched electronically in March and April of 2019. Further searches were conducted through review of bibliographies as well as through inquiries to authors of included studies, relevant researchers and relevant organizations, and completed in March 2020. Selection Criteria We included randomized controlled trials as well as quasi-experimental studies that used quantitative models that attempted to control for endogeneity. Manuscripts could be either published, peer-reviewed articles or grey literature such as working papers, reports and dissertations. Studies must have been published on or after 2000, employed an intervention or exposure that attempted to address a gender-related barrier to schooling, analyzed the effects of the intervention/exposure on at least one of our primary outcomes of interest, and utilized data from LMICs to be included. Data Collection and Analysis A team of reviewers was grouped into pairs to independently screen articles for relevance, extract data and assess risk of bias for each included study. A third reviewer assisted in resolving any disputes. Risk of bias was assessed either through the RoB 2 tool for experimental studies or the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental studies. Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics and reported outcome measures between studies, we applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach adapted for situations where a meta-analysis is not possible to synthesize the research. Results Interventions rated as effective exist for three gender-related barriers: inability to afford tuition and fees, lack of adequate food, and insufficient academic support. Promising interventions exist for three gender-related barriers: inadequate school access, inability to afford school materials, and lack of water and sanitation.More research is needed for the remaining 12 gender-related barriers: lack of support for girls' education, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, lack of information on returns to education/alternative roles for women, school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), lack of safe spaces and social connections, inadequate sports programs for girls, inadequate health and childcare services, inadequate life skills, inadequate menstrual hygiene management (MHM), poor policy/legal environment, lack of teaching materials and supplies, and gender-insensitive school environment. We find substantial gaps in the evidence. Several gender-related barriers to girls' schooling are under-examined. For nine of these barriers we found fewer than 10 relevant evaluations, and for five of the barriers-child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, SRGBV, inadequate sports programs for girls, inadequate health and childcare services, and inadequate MHM-we found fewer than five relevant evaluations; thus, more research is needed to understand the most effective interventions to address many of those barriers. Also, nearly half of programs evaluated in the included studies were multi-component, and most evaluations were not designed to tease out the effects of individual components. As a result, even when interventions were effective overall, it is often difficult to identify how much, if any, of the impact is attributable to a given program component. The combination of components varies between studies, with few comparable interventions, further limiting our ability to identify packages of interventions that work well. Finally, the context-specific nature of these barriers-whether a barrier exists in a setting and how it manifests and operates-means that a program that is effective in one setting may not be effective in another. Authors' Conclusions While some effective and promising approaches exist to address gender-related barriers to education for girls, evidence gaps exist on more than half of our hypothesized gender-related barriers to education, including lack of support for girls' education, SRGBV, lack of safe spaces and social connections, inadequate life skills, and inadequate MHM, among others. In some cases, despite numerous studies examining interventions addressing a specific barrier, studies either did not disaggregate results by sex, or they were not designed to isolate the effects of each intervention component. Differences in context and in implementation, such as the number of program components, curricula content, and duration of interventions, also make it difficult to compare interventions to one another. Finally, few studies looked at pathways between interventions and education outcomes, so the reasons for differences in outcomes largely remain unclear.",2022,,CAMPBELL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,18,1,,WOS:000770389000011,10.1002/cl2.1207,,#678,Psaki 2022,"",""

We sought to investigate individual physiciancharacteristics, including sex and educational background, together with individual preferences ofgraduating EPs, and their association with the salary of theirfirst job.Methods:The American College of Emergency Physicians and the George Washington UniversityMullan Institute surveyed 2019 graduating EPs. The survey included respondents'demographic andeducational background, post-training job characteristics and location, hospital characteristics,importance of different personal priorities, and starting salaries. We performed a multivariable regressionanalysis to determine how salaries were associated with job types and individuals'characteristics.Results:We sent surveys to 2,192 graduating residents in 2019. Of these, 487 (22.2%) responded, and270 (55.4%) acceptedfirst-time clinical jobs and included salary data (12.3% of all surveys sent). Malesex, osteopathic training, and full-time work were significantly associated with higher salary. Men andwomen prioritized different factors in their job search. Women were more likely to consider such factorsas parental leave policy, proximity to family, desired practice setting, type of hospital, and desiredlocation as important. Salary/compensation was considered very important by 51.8% of men and 29.6%of women. Men's median salary was $30,000 more than women's(p=0.01, 95% CI+$6,929-+$53,071), a significant pay differential.Conclusion:Salaries of graduating emergency medicine residents are associated with the resident'ssex and degree type: doctor of osteopathic medicine or doctor of allopathic medicine. Multiple factorsmay contribute to men having higher salaries than women, and some of this difference reflects differentpriorities in their job search. Women were more likely to consider job conditions and setting to bemore important, while men considered salary and compensation more important.

Analysis of an Association between Preterm Birth and Parental Educational Level in Japan Using National Data,"Okui, T","Preterm birth rate depending on parental educational level in recent years has not been surveyed in Japan. In this study, we showed the trend in preterm birth rate depending on parental educational level from 2000 to 2020 by linking data from the Census regarding individuals educational level and parents in birth data of the vital statistics. Four types of parental educational level, namely junior high school, high school, technical school or junior college, and university or graduate school, were compared. Slope and relative indexes of inequality for preterm birth by educational level were computed by binomial models. Data on 3,148,711 births and 381,129,294 people were used in the analysis, and data on 777,086 singleton births were used after data linkage. The preterm birth rate (%) for junior high school graduate mothers and fathers was 5.07 and 5.21 in 2020, respectively. Contrarily, the preterm birth rate (%) for parents who graduated from a university or graduate school was 4.24 for mothers and 4.39 for fathers, and the rate tended to increase as educational level decreased, irrespective of parental gender.

This electronic salary survey is the first to be distributed amongst the entire Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) membership. An electronic survey was sent to all members of the Society. Categorical survey questions assessed membership employment types, annual incomes, and professional certifications, along with other associated career attributes.Methods: This survey was distributed to the SPS membership that is comprised of safety pharmacologists, toxicologists and pharmacologists working globally in the pharmaceutical industry, at contract research organizations (CRO), regulatory agencies, and academia or within the technology provider industry. The survey was open for responses from December 2015 to March 2016.Results: The survey response rate was 28% (129/453). North America (68%) was the region with the largest number of respondents followed by Europe (28%). A preponderance of respondents (77%) had 12 years of industry experience or more. 52% of responders earned annually between $40,000 and $120,000. As expected, salary was generally positively correlated with the number of years of experience in the industry or the educational background but there was no correlation between salary and the number of employee's directly supervised. The median salary was higher for male vs female respondents, but so was median age, indicative of no gender 'salary gap'.Discussion: Our 2016 SPS salary survey results showcased significant diversity regarding factors that can influence salary compensation within this discipline. These data provided insights into the complex global job market trends. They also revealed the level of scientific specialization embedded within the organization, presently uniquely positioned to support the dynamic career paths of current and future safety pharmacologists.",2017,,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS,88,,85-91,WOS:000415223500012,10.1016/j.vascn.2017.08.002,,#682,Pugsley 2017,"",""
The effects of women's joining in paid employment on public place usage: Sakarya Geyve case,"Çetin, R; Türkün, A","This research is about the effects of women's being a part of paid employment on the usage of public places by using women's daily life experiences. Joining paid labour is a crucial strategy for women's empowerment policies. Working outside means leaving home, private space, and being a part of the public places for women. But creating job opportunities for women is not a magical tool that solves all the gender inequalities, on the contrary, Marxist feminists argue that the gendered structure of labour even expands the gap between genders. And feminist geographers underline that women experience public places with a range of barriers created by the patriarchal form of built environments. Even the women have decent works, it is not easy for women to be in public just because the built environment avoids their needs. But despite this hopeless and adverse framework, microanalyses that focus on female workers from developing countries show that women embrace working outside of the home. And when they have proper conditions, they create their empowerment strategies which are slow but deep and strong. This study aims to reveal these empowerments strategies and the needed necessary conditions from the usage of public place perspective. The study case, Geyve in Sakarya, has rural and urban characteristics at the same time. Patriarchal and religious values are deeply embedded in the place. And these values affect the gender roles, labour, and the usage of public places too. Traditionally, women used to work in the agricultural sector as unpaid workers. And their public place usage is limited. But in the 1990s, two food factories opened in Geyve and offered uneducated women a job opportunity aside from the agricultural sector. Women's participation in paid labour in 30 years changed many dynamics, usage of public places too. The study was conducted with the feminist method, focusing on women's standpoint, to understand these changes from the women's perspective. The main data source of this study is the daily life experiences of blue-collar women. These daily life experiences were obtained through in-depth interviews with twenty two female workers. The factory representatives declared that the majority of the female workers are married with children. For this reason, the interviewees were mainly selected from married women with children. The working conditions are critically important in women's changing behaviours, for this reason, the study focused on a work environment where women work in the same environment with men, under the same conditions, and have the same rights. In this context, the study didn't include Geyve's automotive sector. Because this sector is mostly dominated by men. And the textile sector is also out of the scope of the study for a similar reason. Textile sector workers are mostly female and, there is a strong gender hierarchy in this sector. The food factories, which are built in the 1990s and have 1500 workers together, provide the appropriate conditions for the study. In-deep interviews focused on revealing gendered forms of public places, women's questioning interiorised gender roles, and the reflections of these questionings on public place usage. The study showed that women's strategies diversify based on their marital status, owning children, and age. For example, mothers with school-aged children justify their existence in public places with their motherhood identity. And young and single women prefer the same cafes as college students.Older women with adult children do not care to be in public or themselves, but they admire the youngsters and support their younger female members. There are two important common statements from interviews. All interviewees emphasised that they have the same rights to be in public because they work under the same conditions as men, and earn the same money. And they feel safe when they are surrounded by other females when they are in public places. These two statements show that although the women are aware of the unfair patriarchal form of public places, they don't try to demolish it to get their rights. Instead of resisting, they bargain, negotiate, and create small freedom areas for themselves. Joining paid labour and public life are crucial elements of women's empowerment. But women face many barriers in this way because of the patriarchy. Having local information about the women's struggle and survival strategies can be helpful to create ideal working places, empowerment policies, and place-making choices. Hopefully, this study will be useful to understand women's standpoint and include their needs and struggles during the policy-making processes.",2022,,MEGARON,17,1,107-116,WOS:000782363700007,10.14744/MEGARON.2022.08566,,#683,Çetin 2022,"",""

The study finds that private school teachers are associated with lower classroom observation scores than public school teachers, and both private and PPP school teachers are less likely to exhibit content knowledge mastery in Urdu than public school teachers (however, this is not the case for math and English). Public school teachers recruited after the introduction of test-based teacher recruitment are 30 percentage points more likely to demonstrate math content knowledge mastery than teachers recruited prior to test-based recruitment. The study also finds evidence of a pay gap between male and female teachers in both public and PPP schools after controlling for other characteristics.

Assessing the landscape of US postdoctoral salaries,"McDowell, GS; Athanasiadou, R; Bankston, A; Carlisle, M; Niziolek, CA","Purpose - Postdocs make up a significant portion of the biomedical workforce. However, data about the postdoctoral position are generally scarce, and no systematic study of the landscape of individual postdoc salaries in the USA has previously been carried out. The purpose of this study was to assess actual salaries for postdocs using data gathered from US public institutions; determine how these salaries may vary with postdoc title, institutional funding and geographic region; and reflect on which institutional and federal policy measures may have the greatest impact on salaries nationally.Design/methodology/approach - Freedom of Information Act Requests were submitted to US public universities or university systems containing campuses with at least 300 science, engineering and health postdocs, according to the 2015 National Science Foundation's Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering. Salaries and job titles of postdocs as of December 1, 2016, were requested.Findings - Salaries and job titles for nearly 14,000 postdocs at 52 US institutions around December 1, 2016, were received. Individual postdoc names were also received for approximately 7,000 postdocs, and departmental affiliations were received for 4,000 postdocs. This exploratory study shows evidence of a postdoc gender pay gap, a significant influence of job title on postdoc salary and a complex relationship between salaries and the level of institutional National Institutes of Health/NSF funding.Originality/value - These results provide insights into the ability of institutions to collate and report out annualized salary data on their postdocs, highlighting difficulties faced in tracking and reporting data on this population by institutional administration. Ultimately, these types of efforts, aimed at increasing transparency regarding the postdoctoral position, may lead to improved support for postdocs at all US institutions and allow greater agency for postdocs making decisions based on financial concerns.",2018,,STUDIES IN GRADUATE AND POSTDOCTORAL EDUCATION,9,2,213-242,WOS:000451890100008,10.1108/SGPE-D-17-00048,,#686,McDowell 2018,"",""
Feminization of the medical workforce in low-income settings; findings from surveys in three African capital cities,"Russo, G; Gonçalves, L; Craveiro, I; Dussault, G","Background: Women represent an increasingly growing share of the medical workforce in high-income countries, with abundant research focusing on reasons and implications of the phenomenon. Little evidence is available from low-and middle-income countries, which is odd given the possible repercussion this may have for the local supply of medical services and, ultimately, for attaining universal health coverage.Methods: Drawing from secondary analysis of primary survey data, this paper analyses the proportion and characteristics of female physicians in Bissau, Maputo and Praia, with the objective of gaining insights on the extent and features of the feminization of the medical workforce in low-and middle-income settings. We used descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric test to compare groups and explore associations between different variables. Zero-inflated and generalized linear models were employed to analyse the number of hours worked in the private and public sector by male and female physicians.Results and discussion: We show that although female physicians do not represent yet the majority of the medical workforce, feminization of the profession is under way in the three locations analysed, as women are presently over-represented in younger age groups. Female doctors distribute unevenly across medical specialties in the three cities and are absent from traditionally male-dominated ones such as surgery, orthopaedics and stomatology. Our data also show that they engage as much as their male peers in private practice, although overall they dedicate fewer hours to the profession, particularly in the public sector.Conclusions: While more research is needed to understand how this phenomenon affects rural areas in a broader range of locations, our work shows the value of exploring the differences between female and male physicians' engagement with the profession in order to anticipate the impact of such feminization on national health systems and workforces in low-and middle-income countries.",2015,,HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH,13,,,WOS:000358772100001,10.1186/s12960-015-0064-9,,#687,Russo 2015,"",""
"Education, income and risk of cancer: results from a Norwegian registry-based study","Larsen, IK; Myklebust, TÅ; Babigumira, R; Vinberg, E; Moller, B; Ursin, G","Introduction Several studies have shown an association between socioeconomic status and incidence of cancer. In this study, we have examined the association between socioeconomic factors, using income and education as proxies, and cancer incidence in Norway, a country known to be egalitarian, with universal access to health care and scoring high on the human development index. Methods We linked individual data for the total Norwegian population with information on all cancer patients registered in the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) with any cancer diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Data on education, and individual income, were provided from Statistics Norway. We used Poisson regression to obtain incidence rate ratios (IRR) across education and income levels for 23 cancer sites. Results A total of 9 cancers among men and 13 cancers among women were observed to have significantly higher incidence rates in cases with the lowest level of education. Melanoma for both sexes, testis and prostate cancer in men, and breast cancer in women were found to have a higher incidence rate among those with the highest level of education. The largest differences in IRR were found for lung cancer, where men and women with college or university education as their highest completed education had a two- to threefold decreased risk, compared to those with primary school (IRR men; 0.40 [0.37-0.43], women 0.34 [0.31-0.37]). The results for income mirrored the results for education among men, while for women we did not observe many differences in cancer risk across income groups.

Systematization of Socioeconomic Factors that Determine Health Inequality: A Literature Review,"Shibalkov, IP; Pavlova, IA; Nedospasova, OP; Tagina, EK","Academic and expert community is continuously researching all aspects of inequality. However, problems of inequality in healthcare (due to objective circumstances (ethnicity, gender, etc.) and settings in which people are born, grow up, work, and age) have been studied to a lesser extent. The study aims to summarize and analyze literature on the identification and systematization of socioeconomic factors affecting inequality in health on individual and population levels. Health factors are primarily determined by a person's socioeconomic position (SEP), including education, income, and occupation. Socio-economic factors that determine inequality in health are all factors that affect the absolute and relative (relative to other members of the society in which the individual lives) social and economic situation of a person. In addition to them, the analysis includes institutions that potentially influence a person's health: a person, at their own free will or in connection with established norms, interacts with these institutions regularly during their life. A literature review using the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Russian Science Citation Index databases was carried out. The search depth by the time parameter had no restrictions. The keywords ""socioeconomic status"", ""socioeconomic position"", ""inequality in health"", ""health factors"" were used to analyze more than 350 publications. The analysis allowed us to divide socioeconomic factors into the following categories and subcategories related to education (level of education of a person, level of education of a partner, gender differences in education, medical awareness), welfare and financial security (level of income, income inequality in society, macroeconomic parameters), employment and labor relations (nature and conditions of work, support of employment by the state), environmental factors (ecology and climate, physical habitat, social environment, health care). The factors are also systematized according to the levels of influence: individual level (micro-level), a person's inner circle (meso-level), and society as a whole (macro-level). The study identifies the relationship between various aspects of a person's SEP and their health for the majority of the factor groups for both developed and developing countries. The study results amend and strengthen arguments confirming the importance of the effective functioning of institutions responsible for the health of the population and explain their institutional roles for improving the quality of life and well-being of citizens throughout their life trajectories. In this regard, a systematic study of the factors that determine inequality in health creates conditions for improving the quality of the institutional framework and substantiating the effectiveness of measures aimed at minimizing inequality in health at the micro-, meso-, macro-levels for increasing the well-being of the entire socioeconomic system.",2021,,TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL,,468,101-114,WOS:000727809000012,10.17223/15617793/468/12,,#689,Shibalkov 2021,"",""
"Disparities in glycaemic control, monitoring, and treatment of type 2 diabetes in England: A retrospective cohort analysis","Whyte, MB; Hinton, W; McGovern, A; van Vlymen, J; Ferreira, F; Calderara, S; Mount, J; Munro, N; de Lusignan, S","Author summaryWhy was this study done? There are few studies of ethnic disparities in diabetes care conducted in healthcare systems free at the point of delivery and with adjustment for socioeconomic status. These have generally shown overall improvement in diabetes management and outcomes over time, but with persistent imbalance between population groups. A number of initiatives have attempted to redress disparity of care in diabetes management in the UK over the last decade. What did the researchers do and find? We set out to determine whether there are healthcare disparities (inequalities between the sexes or across socioeconomic and ethnic groups) in the care of people with type 2 diabetes. We analysed routinely collected data from a network of primary care practices in England for measures of clinical outcomes, prescribing, and care processes for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our study provides up-to-date information on care processes and metabolic outcomes for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found disparities in glycaemic control, disease monitoring, and prescribing between ethnicities and socioeconomic groups, and a weak difference between the sexes. What do these findings mean? The commissioning of diabetes services must continue with the ambition to reduce inequalities and thereby improve population health for individuals with type 2 diabetes.Background Disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2D) care provision and clinical outcomes have been reported in the last 2 decades in the UK. Since then, a number of initiatives have attempted to address this imbalance. The aim was to evaluate contemporary data as to whether disparities exist in glycaemic control, monitoring, and prescribing in people with T2D. Methods and findings A T2D cohort was identified from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre dataset: a nationally representative sample of 164 primary care practices (general practices) across England. Diabetes healthcare provision and glucose-lowering medication use between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 were studied. Healthcare provision included annual HbA1c, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), blood pressure (BP), retinopathy, and neuropathy testing. Variables potentially associated with disparity outcomes were assessed using mixed effects logistic and linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and nested using random effects within general practices. Ethnicity was defined using the Office for National Statistics ethnicity categories: White, Mixed, Asian, Black, and Other (including Arab people and other groups not classified elsewhere). From the primary care adult population (n = 1,238,909), we identified a cohort of 84,452 (5.29%) adults with T2D. The mean age of people with T2D in the included cohort at 31 December 2016 was 68.7 +/- 12.6 years; 21,656 (43.9%) were female. The mean body mass index was 30.7 +/- SD 6.4 kg/m(2). The most deprived groups (IMD quintiles 1 and 2) showed poorer HbA1c than the least deprived (IMD quintile 5). People of Black ethnicity had worse HbA1c than those of White ethnicity. Asian individuals were less likely than White individuals to be prescribed insulin (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.95; p < 0.01), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.79; p < 0.001), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.31-0.44; p < 0.001). Black individuals were less likely than White individuals to be prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.65; p < 0.001) and GLP-1 agonists (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.57; p < 0.001). Individuals in IMD quintile 5 were more likely than those in the other IMD quintiles to have annual testing for HbA1c, BP, eGFR, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Black individuals were less likely than White individuals to have annual testing for HbA1c (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.99; p = 0.04) and retinopathy (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96; p = 0.011). Asian individuals were more likely than White individuals to have monitoring for HbA1c (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20; p = 0.023) and eGFR (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.19; p = 0.048), but less likely for retinopathy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97; p = 0.01) and neuropathy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01). The study is limited by the nature of being observational and defined using retrospectively collected data. Disparities in diabetes care may show regional variation, which was not part of this evaluation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that disparity in glycaemic control, diabetes-related monitoring, and prescription of newer therapies remains a challenge in diabetes care. Both SES and ethnicity were important determinants of inequality.Disparities in glycaemic control and other areas of care may lead to higher rates of complications and adverse outcomes for some groups.",2019,,PLOS MEDICINE,16,10,,WOS:000495435800013,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002942,,#690,Whyte 2019,"",""
How Community College Educations Generate Both Science Capital and Science-Specific Transfer Capital Among Low-Income White Women Majoring in STEM,"Stearns, E; Mickelson, R; Bottia, M; Allen, DD; Dancy, M; Moller, S","Given current enrollment patterns that feature a predominance of women, community college enrollment may offer potential for increasing gender diversity in STEM fields if students transfer successfully to four-year institutions. While many do not transfer, those who do can increase their stocks of science capital while enrolled at community college. This project follows pathways of some of the low-income students who successfully complete transfers to four-year institutions, focusing on interviews with White women. While not positive in every aspect, community college enrollment offered these low-income interviewees time to build science-related social and cultural capital that then helped them to succeed in transferring to four-year universities and to support them in STEM fields they perceived as being male-dominated. All the students came from households with low levels of science capital and had not strongly considered majoring in STEM prior to enrolling in community college. Interviewees describe their time at community colleges as critical in allowing them to explore STEM fields, construct positive relationships with STEM instructors, improve their time management skills, and increase their STEM self-confidence. These increased stores of science capital were not sufficient to keep all the transfer students majoring in STEM fields but did support the educational trajectories of all transfer students. Thus, community college enrollment can give students time to incubate both science capital and science-related transfer capital, the latter being especially useful for low-income White women in STEM.Community colleges enroll more women than they do men. As a result, they may be able to provide more students who might help to address goals to increase the number of women who are earning degrees in science, math, technology, and engineering (STEM) fields at four-year colleges. Most students who study at community colleges do not transfer to four-year universities, but something can be learned from the experiences of students who do make a successful transfer. In this paper, we interviewed seven low-income White women who were enrolled in several community colleges and said they wanted to transfer to four-year universities to study STEM majors, then followed up with them three years later. We found that their time at community college helped them to build skills and make connections that increased their probability of success in STEM fields. Notably, they learned how to manage their time, talked with professors and advisors, and received information about what studying STEM would look like during college and what jobs would be available for them after college. They also increased their self-confidence in studying STEM. All the students came from households with relatively low levels of information about science and were able to exit community college in a better position to succeed in STEM than they were when they entered.",2024,,COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,,,,WOS:001285589500001,10.1080/10668926.2024.2383204,,#691,Stearns 2024,"",""
The influence of physical activity on internet addiction among Chinese college students: the mediating role of self-esteem and the moderating role of gender,"Du, ZH; Wang, T; Sun, YJ; Zhai, F","Objectives The significance of self-esteem in the relationship between physical activity and Internet addiction among college students cannot be over, as it lays a solid foundation for the prevention and control of Internet addiction. Methods A total of 950 college students were surveyed using the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Chinese Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS-R) through a cluster random sampling method. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, partial correlation analysis, mediation effect, moderation effect, and Bootstrap testing were conducted on the collected data to analyze and interpret the results. Results(1) Significant gender differences were found in the amount of physical activity and the degree of Internet addiction among college students(P&& lt;0.001); (2) Physical activity was significantly and positively correlated with self-esteem (r = 0.26, P < 0.001), but significantly and negatively correlated with Internet addiction (r=-0.23, P < 0.001); Meanwhile, self-esteem and Internet addiction were significantly and negatively related to self-esteem (r=-0.22, P < 0.001). (3) Mediating effect analyses showed that self-esteem played a partial mediating role in physical activity and Internet addiction among college students, accounting for a portion of 78.95%. (4) A moderating effect of gender on the relationship between physical activity and Internet addiction was discovered. Conclusion The physical activity level of male students is significantly higher than that of female students, while the degree of internet addiction among female students is notably higher than that of male students. Physical activity can not only directly improve the issue of internet addiction among college students, but also indirectly improve it through self-esteem, with gender playing a moderating role in this process. This conclusion has practical reference significance for preventing and controlling internet addiction among college students, and provides evidence support for using physical activity as a reference solution in clinical applications. Additionally, it suggests that gender should be taken into account when preventing and intervening in internet addiction among college students, and different strategies and methods should be adopted for male and female students. Male students should be encouraged to participate more in physical activities, gradually increasing the frequency, duration, and intensity of their participation, in order to divert their attention and enhance their sense of achievement in sports, thereby reducing their use of mobile phones. For female students, on the other hand, it is important to strengthen real-life communication, change the form of sports participation, engage in group, collaborative, and different situational sports activities, and enhance their focus and attention in sports, in order to reduce their internet dependency, better guide them to use the internet reasonably, and enable them to achieve emotional release through sports.",2024,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,24,1,,WOS:001195654900006,10.1186/s12889-024-18474-1,,#692,Du 2024,"",""
"Taking the carbon capture and storage, wind power, PV or other renewable technology path to fight climate change? Exploring the acceptance of climate change mitigation technologies - A Danish national representative study","Ladenburg, J; Kim, J; Zuch, M; Soytas, U","Despite numerous prior studies regarding public acceptance of climate change mitigation technologies, most academic papers focus on individual technologies in their analyses. Little is known about the acceptance of multiple low-carbon energy technologies. This study bridges this research gap and explores the cross-technology acceptance of various energy solutions at different locations. Thus, we provide a comprehensive understanding of public acceptance patterns by analysing a broader range of technologies concurrently, focusing on: (a) nuclear power, (b) district heating, (c) energy-saving technologies, (d) onshore, nearshore, and offshore wind power (WP), (e) photovoltaics (PV) installed on agricultural land, industrial roofs, and private roofs, and (f) carbon capture and storage (CCS) in offshore, nearshore, rural onshore, and urban onshore locations. Based on Danish nationally representative survey data, our results give strong policy indications that PV on industrial rooftops is accepted at the highest level. In contrast, nuclear power, onshore rural and urban CCS, and nearshore CCS are the least accepted technologies to combat climate change among the Danish public. Additionally, we discover that the acceptance of a specific technology is contingent on locations. Specifically, the public acceptance of PV, WP, and CCS depends on the place of living and the potential location of technology placement. Finally, this study explores subgroup analyses to compare acceptance differences according to gender, age, education, income, and location of residence.",2024,,RENEWABLE ENERGY,220,,,WOS:001113090100001,10.1016/j.renene.2023.119582,,#693,Ladenburg 2024,"",""
Barriers and facilitators to primary healthcare utilization among immigrants and refugees of low and middle-income countries: a scoping review,"Moezzi, SMI; Etemadi, M; Lankarani, KB; Behzadifar, M; Katebzada, H; Shahabi, S","IntroductionPrimary health care (PHC) is the most common model for providing primary care, and PHC services are the most common points of care that immigrants and refugees attend as a first step. Most immigrants travel to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet only a few studies have examined their health conditions and their access to PHC in these countries. We have attempted to identify the barriers and facilitators that immigrants and refugees encounter when using PHC in these countries.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and OpenGrey in this scoping review from its inception to the end of October 2023. Moreover, we manually searched key journals, reference lists, and citations from included studies to identify any missed studies. We extracted data from each selected study using a predefined form. Finally, a thematic analysis approach was utilized to synthesize the collected data from the included qualitative studies.Results17 qualitative studies were included in this review, which were from Iran (n = 3), Brazil (n = 3), Kenya (n = 2), Jordan (n = 2), Eastern Sudan (n = 1), Lebanon (n = 1), Bangladesh (n = 1), India (n = 1), Turkey (n = 1), Thailand (n = 1), and Malaysia (n = 1). Among the most common and important reported barriers are language differences, insufficiency of trained carers, unemployment, inability to pay the costs of hospital and medicines, no insurance coverage for immigrants, no clear referral and care system for immigrants, discrimination against women, and improper residence locations. Insurance coverage, awareness programs, and the study of immigrants' needs, along with their social and financial support from family, are among the most essential facilitators.ConclusionFor LMICs, funding is always a limitation, and increasing PHC utilization is the best choice for improving health. Knowing the challenges and facilitators of PHC utilization from the point of view of each stakeholder is a promising way to decide and make policies that can improve the health of both immigrants and refugees, as well as society as a whole.",2024,,GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH,20,1,,WOS:001341439200001,10.1186/s12992-024-01079-z,,#694,Moezzi 2024,"",""
Assessing perceived effectiveness of career development efforts led by the women in American Medical Informatics Association Initiative,"Wei, D; Kukhareva, PV; Tao, DH; Sordo, M; Pandita, D; Dua, P; Banerjee, I; Abraham, J","Objective: We sought to ascertain perceived factors affecting women's career development efforts in the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) and to provide recommendations for improvements.Materials and Methods: Data were collected using a 27-item survey administered via the AMIA newsletter and other social channels. Survey questions comprised 3 demographics, 15 Likert-scale, and 9 open-ended items. Likert-scale responses were summarized across respondent ages, career stages, and career domains, and open-ended responses were thematically analyzed.Results: We received survey responses from 109 AMIA women members. Our findings demonstrate that AMIA had made strides in promoting career development, and the most effective AMIA efforts included social events (83%), panel discussions (80%), and scientific sessions (79%). However, despite these efforts, women members perceived that gender-specific challenges persisted within AMIA, and recognized the need for increased networking opportunities (96%), raising awareness of gender-specific challenges (95%), and encouraging gender proportional representation in leadership (92%).Discussion: International and national biomedical informatics professional communities have put forth efforts to address gender-specific issues in career development. Yet, our study identified that some of these, including the deep-rooted gender power hierarchy and bias, are still perceived as profound in AMIA.Conclusion: Even though existing career development efforts for women are highly effective, important perceived gender-specific career development issues require further attention and investigation to improve existing AMIA activities.",2022,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,29,9,1593-1606,WOS:000819309900001,10.1093/jamia/ocac101,,#696,Wei 2022,"",""
Are Community-College Students Increasingly Choosing High-Paying Fields of Study? Evidence from Massachusetts,"Murnane, RJ; Willett, JB; Mcdonough, A; Papay, JP; Mantil, A","The labor-market payoff to workers with associate degrees in healthcare and STEM occupations is very high in Massachusetts.

Articles were reviewed from four issues per journal per year, and data was collected on: time of publication; subspeciality; number of authors; sex of first and last authors; country of practice of first author and country where each study was conducted. Trends were examined though univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results 2998 articles were included. 93.9% of first authors and 94.2% of studies were from high-income countries.Women were first authors in 31.5% (n = 912) and senior authors in 18.4% (n = 524) of articles. Female first authorship significantly increased between 2011 and 2020 however female senior authorship remained the same. There have been no significant changes in the proportion of published articles from low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) over time (p = .65).

Receipt of Corrective Lenses and Academic Performance of Low-Income Students,"Dudovitz, RN; Sim, MS; Elashoff, D; Klarin, J; Slusser, W; Chung, PJ","OBJECTIVE: Untreated vision problems are associated with poor school performance. Whether providing glasses alone improves performance, however, remains unknown. We sought to test whether receiving glasses was associated with improved school performance for low-income minority students in Los Angeles.METHODS: From 2017 to 2018, we analyzed achievement marks in mathematics and language arts from 406 first to fifth grade students attending 24 public elementary schools who received glasses through a free school-based vision program between February and May 2014, and 23,393 of their non-participating same-school, same-grade peers. We calculated students' percentile rank during each grading period in 1 year before and 2 years since they received glasses. Multilevel linear regressions tested whether percentile rank differed from baseline at each subsequent grading period. Models accounted for clustering at the school level and controlled for gender, grade level, and baseline class rank. Interaction terms tested whether associations differed by gender and class rank.RESULTS: Students increased 4.5 percentile points (P=.02) in language arts in the second year after receiving glasses. There was no change in math achievement overall; however, those with baseline performance in the bottom tercile had an immediate and sustained improvement of 10 to 24 percentile points from baseline (interaction term P<.001). Class rank for behavior marks decreased during the fourth grading period after receiving glasses but subsequently returned to baseline. There were no significant changes in work habits and no variation in results by gender.CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring access to vision care may be a simple, scalable strategy to improve language arts performance for low-income minority children.",2020,,ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS,20,7,910-916,WOS:000571991900009,,,#700,Dudovitz 2020,"",""
Different sedentary behavior domains present distinct associations with eating-related indicators,"Júdice, PB; Carraça, EV; Santos, I; Palmeira, AL; Jeronimo, F; Silva, MN","Background Unhealthful dietary patterns have been consistently associated with low levels of physical activity (PA), but studies dedicated to sedentary behavior (SB) are scarce, especially in adults. The few studies that investigated the association between SB and dietary patterns focused mostly on specific types of SB, such as TV-watching or screen time. SB can be accumulated in distinct domains (i.e., work, transport, and leisure-time), thus, it is key to investigate in depth the impact that different domains of SB can have on eating-related indicators. We aimed to investigate the associations between different SB domains and eating-related indicators, in a sample of adults.Methods Cross-sectional data from students, teachers, and staff from a Portuguese University was collected in November/2021 through an anonymous online survey. Data analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS software (version 28.0) and included descriptive statistics, partial correlations, and group comparisons using one-way ANOVA. Daily average SB at work/study, transport, and in leisure-time were self-reported and eating-related indicators were measured with several items from the Mediterranean Diet Score. Specific eating-related behaviors reflecting a protective eating pattern (e.g., eating breakfast regularly), and eating behavior traits (e.g., external eating) were also assessed. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height(m)2. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire/Short-Form was used to assess PA.Results The sample included 301 adults (60.1% women), with a mean age of 34.5 years. Overall, leisure-time SB was inversely associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet (r = -0.20; p < 0.001) and with a protective eating profile (r = -0.31; p < 0.001). Higher transport SB was also related to lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet (r = -0.20; p < 0.001) and to an unhealthier eating profile (r = -0.22; p < 0.001), but no associations were found for work-related SB (p > 0.05). These results persisted after the adjustment for BMI, sex, and self-reported PA. These results were impacted by the age tertile.Conclusions Our findings suggest that adults with higher levels of SB in leisure-time and transport domains tend to report less healthy eating-related behaviors, irrespective of BMI, sex, and PA level. However, some differences in these associations were found according to the age tertile. This information may assist public health authorities in focusing their efforts in augmenting literacy on SB, namely on how SB can be accumulated via different settings. Furthermore, public health literacy efforts need to extend besides the more known deleterious effects of SB on health (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease), to also include the interplay with eating indicators. Strategies to reduce SB and unhealthy eating should be particularly focused on promoting physically active forms of commuting and reducing SB in the leisure setting.",2024,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,24,1,,WOS:001148300400001,10.1186/s12889-024-17760-2,,#701,Júdice 2024,"",""
Income-based inequalities in hypertension and in undiagnosed hypertension: analysis of Health Survey for England data,"Scholes, S; Conolly, A; Mindell, JS","Objective: To quantify income-based inequalities in hypertension and in undiagnosed hypertension.Methods: We used nationally representative data from 28 002 adults (aged 16 years and older) living in private households who participated in the cross-sectional Health Survey for England 2011-2016. Using bivariate probit regression modelling, we jointly modelled hypertension and self-reported previous diagnosis of hypertension by a doctor or nurse. We then used the model estimates to quantify inequalities in undiagnosed hypertension. Inequalities, using household income tertiles as an indicator of socioeconomic status, were quantified using average marginal effects (AMEs) after adjustment for confounding variables.Results: Overall, 32% of men and 27% of women had survey-defined hypertension (measured blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg and/or currently using medicine to treat high blood pressure). Higher proportions (38% of men and 32% of women) either self-reported previous diagnosis or had survey-defined hypertension. Of these, 65% of men and 70% of women had diagnosed hypertension.

"Descriptive Study of Economic Behavior of General Practitioners in Iran: Practice Income, Hours of Work, and Patient Visits","Bayati, M; Rashidian, A","Background: Although there is a critical need for information on economic performance of Iranian general practitioners (GPs) in health policymaking, there is not any scientific evidence in this area. Therefore, in the present report, the characteristics of economic behaviors of Iranian GPs were described. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in 2015, in which the data were collected from 666 GPs. The variables including monthly gross income, hours of work, and patient visits were studied as the measures of economic behavior of GPs. Descriptive statistics, t-test, and Analysis of Variance were used for analyzing the data. The statistical analysis was performed by STATA12. Results: The annual income of the GPs understudy was 26,000 US dollar (USD) (82,680 purchasing power parity [PPP]). The ratio of this value to gross domestic product per capita and minimum wage of Iran in 2015 was 4.8 and 9.2, respectively. On average, every GP in Iran has an income of 2188.1 USD (6958.16 PPP), works 142 h, and visits an average of 494 patients/month. The results showed that the economic behavior of Iranian GPs has a significant difference in terms of gender, age, marital status, practice experience, practice location, type of practice, being a family physicians, and working in different settings (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The Iranian GPs understudy work less than their counterparts in other (compared) countries.

Little is known about the clinical hours worked and financial compensation received by fellows during training. We sought to describe the clinical duties and financial compensation of EM fellows at U.S. academic centers. MethodsThis cross-sectional study surveyed U.S. academic EM department administrators who were members of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine's Academy of Administrators in Academic Emergency Medicine (AAAEM) regarding their fellowship programs and fellows. We electronically distributed the validated survey instrument to 73 member sites between October 2022 and January 2023. Survey domains included fellow and fellowship demographics, base and total annual clinical hours, and base and total annual compensation. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared fellows by accreditation (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME] or non-ACGME) using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. We conducted a secondary analysis of base and total salary by gender and accreditation using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. ResultsWe received 38 institutional responses (response rate 52%), which represented 217 individual fellows. Nearly three-fourths (n = 158, 72.8%) of fellows enrolled in non-ACGME fellowships, worked 33% more base hours annually than ACGME fellows (median 571 h vs. 768 h, p < 0.001), and received base compensation 20% higher than ACGME fellows ($88,540 vs. $70,777, p < 0.001).

Physicians' Earnings Do Not Affect Their Online Ratings,"Haffey, SC; Hopman, WM; Leveridge, MJ","Objective:Physician-rating websites have exploded in popularity in recent years. Consequently, these sites have garnered attention from researchers interested in factors influencing patient satisfaction. A doctor's earnings might reflect practice patterns that could influence their patients' perceptions. We sought to explore any association between physicians' earnings and their online ratings. Methods:The names and billings of 500 physicians from British Columbia, Canada were randomly extracted from the 2016-17BC Blue Bookand matched to their profiles onRateMDs.com. Physicians' earnings were compared to their global ratings and to their Staff, Punctuality, Helpfulness, and Knowledge scores. Earnings and ratings were also compared between men and women, as well as between family medicine, surgical, and internal medicine and subspecialties cohorts. Results:We found no significant correlation between physicians' earnings and their global online ratings (p= 0.304). Weak negative correlations existed between earnings and Staff and Helpfulness ratings (Spearman's rho = -0.055,p< 0.001; rho = -0.033,p< 0.028). Online ratings were largely favorable (mean MD rating of 3.85/5. Male physicians earned significantly more than their female colleagues ($371,734.85 and $261,590.82, respectively;p< 0.001), but no significant difference existed between men and women with regards to online ratings (mean 3.87 and 3.81, respectively,p= 0.191). Surgical and Family Medicine specialties showed a negative correlation between income and ratings; no relationship was seen in the internal medicine and subspecialties cohort. Conclusions:No meaningful association was found between physicians' earnings and their online ratings, although there is an impact of specialty grouping.

Assessing the Inequality of Early Child Development in China-A Population-Based Study,"Zhang, YT; Kang, L; Zhao, J; Song, YQ; Jiang, F; Lu, CL","Background: As a country with the second largest child population in the world, China has little population-level evidence on who has been left behind in early childhood development (ECD). Knowl-edge of inequalities in ECD will inform the Chinese government in policies on promoting ECD and guide global-level monitoring on ECD progress. Methods: Using data from the first wave of ECD surveys conducted in China at the least-developed re-gion, most-developed region, and a megacity (Shanghai) in 2017 and 2018, we measured population-level ECD with early Human Capability Index for a total of 63,559 children aged 36-59 months old. A child was classified as developmentally on track if his/her overall development score was above the 20th per-centile of the pooled populations. We measured inequalities in ECD with the absolute inequality in five domains: gender/sex, family income, maternal schooling, residential Hukou, and migrant-or left-behind status. Besides observed inequalities, we used a multilevel logistic regression model to generate adjusted inequalities. Findings: Children developmentally on track ranges from 71% (95% CI 70 to 72%) in the least-developed region, 82% (95% CI 81 to 83%) in the most-developed region, and 86% (95% CI 85 to 87%) in Shanghai. Significant unadjusted inequalities in ECD were observed in all five dimensions. After controlling for other socioeconomic factors, significant differences remained in three dimensions: those living in the poorest families, or with lower maternal schooling, or boys were less likely to be developmentally on track than their counterparts (lower by 10[95% CI 8 to 11]-15[95% CI 13 to 17], 7[95% CI 5 to 10]-10[95% CI 7 to 12], and 5[95% CI 4 to 6]-6[95% CI 5 to 8] percentage points respectively). Interpretation: Efforts of reducing ECD inequalities in China shall focus primarily on reducing poverty and improving maternal education.

The objective of this study was to investigate socio-demographic inequities in cervical cancer screening and utilization of treatment among women in Harare, Zimbabwe.MethodsTwo cross sectional surveys were conducted in Harare with a total sample of 277 women aged at least 25years. In the community survey, stratified random sampling was conducted to select 143 healthy women in Glen View, Cranborne, Highlands and Hopely communities of Harare to present high, medium, low density suburbs and rural areas respectively. In the patient survey, 134 histologically confirmed cervical cancer patients were also randomly selected at Harare hospital, Parirenyatwa Hospital and Island Hospice during their routine visits or while in hospital admission. All consenting participants were interviewed using a validated structured questionnaire programmed in Surveytogo software in an android tablet. Data was analyzed using STATA version 14 to yield descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression outcomes for the study.ResultsWomen who reported ever screening for cervical cancer were only 29%. Cervical cancer screening was less likely in women affiliated to major religions (p<0.05) and those who never visited health facilities or doctors or visited once in previous 6months (p<0.05). Ninety-two (69%) of selected patients were on treatment.

THE NOT-SO-MERRY WIVES OF <i>WINDSOR</i>: THE TAXATION OF WOMEN IN SAME-SEX MARRIAGES,"Kahng, L","In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act definition of marriage as ""between one man and one woman,"" heralding its subsequent recognition, in Obergefell v. Hodges, of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Windsor cleared the way for same-sex couples to be treated as married under federal tax laws, and the Obama administration promptly announced that it would recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes. Academics, policymakers, and activists lauded these developments as finally achieving tax equality between same- and different-sex married couples. This Article argues that the claimed tax equality of Windsor is illusory and that the only way to achieve actual equality is to eliminate taxation on the basis of marital status.Focusing on the taxation of women in same-sex marriages, the Article explores what lies beneath the putative equality gains that result from according same-sex married couples the same status as different-sex married couples. The Article predicts, based on demographic statistics and other sociological and economic research relating to income levels, wealth holdings, child rearing, and employment patterns, that women in same-sex marriages will be less likely than other married people to reap the benefits, and more likely to suffer the detriments, of marriage taxation. In analyzing why women in same-sex marriages are likely to suffer adverse consequences from their new tax status as married, the Article builds on prior critical and feminist tax literature showing how the tax law though purportedly neutral in its treatment of married couples privileges traditional marriages in which men are the primary income earners and wealth holders, and adversely affects married women's incentives and abilities to be workers, income producers, and wealth holders. The Article argues that the tax law, through the fictitious construction of the married couple as an irreducible economic unit, continues to reward this anachronistic model of marriage and to penalize other, more egalitarian models of marriage. The Article proposes that taxation on basis of marital status be curtailed through the abolition of the joint return and through other reforms. More broadly, the Article demonstrates how taxation is a powerful tool by which the state regulates intimate relationships, and it highlights the need for a careful and critical evaluation of other marriage laws as they extend their reach to same-sex relationships.",2016,,CORNELL LAW REVIEW,101,2,325-383,WOS:000369121000002,,,#709,Kahng 2016,"",""
Relative remoteness and wage differentials in the Canadian allied health I professional workforce br,"Gupta, N; Gulliver, A; Singh, P","Introduction: Health workforces around the world are characterized with geographic maldistribution, often leading to inequalities in rural health outcomes. Monetary incentives are frequently raised as a policy option to bolster recruitment of healthcare practitioners to rural and underserved communities; however, few rural health workforce studies focus on allied health professionals (AHPs), include urban comparators, integrate gender considerations, or measure rural diversity. This population-based observational study examines trends in the geographic and gender distribution and earnings of AHPs in Canada across the rural-urban continuum.Methods: Nationally representative data from the 2006 and 2016 Canadian population censuses were pooled and linked with the geocoded Index of Remoteness for all inhabited communities. Five groups of university-educated AHPs providing prevention, diagnostic evaluation, therapy, and rehabilitation services were identified by occupation. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between relative remoteness and annual earnings of AHPs aged 25-54 years, controlling for gender and other personal and professional characteristics.Results: The density of AHPs was found to be 15 times higher in more urbanized and accessible parts of the country (23.6-25.6 per 10 000 population in 2016) compared to the most rural and remote areas (1.6 per 10 000 population), a pattern that changed little over the previous decade. A positive correlation was seen across occupations in terms of the degree of feminization and their geographic dispersion by relative remoteness. While pharmacists residing in more rural and remote communities earned 9% (95% confidence interval 4-15%) more than those in core urban centers, relative remoteness contributed little to wage differentials among dentists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, or other AHPs in therapy and assessment (no significant difference at p<0.05). Women earned significantly less than men in dentistry, pharmacy, and physical or occupational therapy, after adjusting for remoteness and other characteristics.Conclusion: This study did not find consistent wage disparities by relative remoteness as characterizing allied health professions in Canada. The evidence base to support financial incentives to AHPs to reduce perceived opportunity costs associated with working and living in rural and underserved areas remains limited. More research is needed on the intersections of rurality, gender, and wage differentials among AHPs in different national contexts.",2023,,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,23,2,,WOS:001011431500002,10.22605/RRH7882,,#710,Gupta 2023,"",""
Routine ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks' gestation,"Agten, AK; Xia, J; Servante, JA; Thornton, JG; Jones, NW","BackgroundUltrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination.ObjectivesTo assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise.To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately.Search methodsWe searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcomeMain resultsOur review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation. Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published.First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US).First trimester scans probably reduce short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate-certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence).The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported.Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US.Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence).Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low-certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating.Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence).Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence).Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence).The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported.Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster-RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia.This trial included a co-intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately.Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low-certainty evidence).Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK.The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsEarly scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety.Later scans may reduce labour induction for post-maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data.Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.",2021,,COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,,8,,WOS:000692889600005,10.1002/14651858.CD014698,,#711,Agten 2021,"",""
A compensatory role for declarative memory in neurodevelopmental disorders,"Ullman, Michael T.; Pullman, Mariel Y.","Most research on neurodevelopmental disorders has focused on their abnormalities. However, what remains intact may also be important. Increasing evidence suggests that declarative memory, a critical learning and memory system in the brain, remains largely functional in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. Because declarative memory remains functional in these disorders, and because it can learn and retain numerous types of information, functions, and tasks, this system should be able to play compensatory roles for multiple types of impairments across the disorders. Here, we examine this hypothesis for specific language impairment, dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. We lay out specific predictions for the hypothesis and review existing behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence. Overall, the evidence suggests that declarative memory indeed plays compensatory roles for a range of impairments across all five disorders. Finally, we discuss diagnostic, therapeutic and other implications.

Sociocultural factors might play an important role among Hispanic women; however, very few studies have examined this association. Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine the associations between acculturation and maternal diet, physical activity, and PPWR. Design: This is a cross-sectional study of baseline data from 282 Hispanic women participating in the FitMoms/Mamás Activas study, a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of primarily an internet-based weight control program, in reducing PPWR among low-income women. We performed multivariable linear regression to examine the association of acculturation with diet quality, physical activity, and PPWR at study entry. Results: A total of 213 (76%) women had acculturation scores reflecting Mexican orientation or bicultural orientation, whereas 69 (24%) had scores that represented assimilation to Anglo culture. Women who were more acculturated had lower intakes of fruits and vegetables, lower HEI scores, and lower physical activity levels than women who were less acculturated (p < 0.05). We found an association between acculturation and PPWR in that for every 1-unit increase in acculturation score, PPWR increased, on average, by 0.80 kg. Conclusion: Higher acculturation was associated with poorer diet and physical activity behaviors and greater PPWR.

"Addressing cancer screening inequities by promoting cancer prevention knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and screening uptake among low-income and illiterate immigrant women in France","De Jesus, Maria; Rodrigue, Christelle M.; Rahmani, Sarah; Balamou, Christian","Objective: Cancer screening rates are suboptimal for disadvantaged populations in France, yet little evidence exists on their cancer-related knowledge and screening barriers. The main objective of this study was to examine cancer-related knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and perceptions of screening barriers among low-income, illiterate immigrant women in France following an 8-weeks cancer educational intervention. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 164 female participants in the Ain department of France between January 2019 and March 2020. Adopting the Health Belief Model as an intervention and analytic framework, salient themes were identified using qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Increased levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of cancer contributed to higher motivation to get screened. Barriers to screening included low French proficiency, shame surrounding illiteracy, and constant worries due to precarious living conditions. Perceived benefits (e.g., valuing one’s health and health-promoting behaviors), cues to action from a trusted source, and greater self-efficacy (e.g., more autonomous in healthcare-seeking) outweighed perceived barriers, including cultural barriers. Conclusions: Implications include developing audience-responsive targeted cancer screening communication strategies and educational materials to increase screening rates and reduce cancer and cancer screening inequities.

Advocating the use of threshold effects estimation: An illustration using the gender wage gap,"Yerger, David B.; Stephenson, Amber L.","While linear models remain the backbone of human resource development (HRD) as well as broader social science research, they are limited by their inability to detect curvilinearity or changes in direction and, therefore, may not accurately represent the nature of relationships between variables. This paper advocates the utility of the Andrews' (1993) threshold effect technique in the HRD, work, organization, and employment study literatures and does so using the gender wage gap as an illustration. The analysis compares traditional linear regression, a curvilinear quadratic model, and the threshold effect technique using publicly available wage data. This article demonstrates how the threshold method permits the data to organically determine the location of a critical break point, should one exist, and how it addresses the problem of overlooked relationships due to traditional linear assumptions. An overview of the technique and related coding is provided for researchers interested in broadening their analytical arsenal to enhance the study of the gender wage gap as well as other human‐resource‐related phenomena.

Ambivalent effects of highly estimated personal strengths on adaptive functioning and internalizing symptoms in non-clinical autistic females,"Sejima, Kanako; Uozumi, Ryuji; Murai, Toshiya; Funabiki, Yasuko","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 43(23) of Current Psychology: A Journal for Diverse Perspectives on Diverse Psychological Issues (see record [rid]2024-97417-003[/rid]). The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake. Regarding the WHO-QOL BRIEF values in Table 1 (p.2560), the Low group for females and the High group for males were incorrectly listed and interchanged. The correct values are 87.3 (12.1) instead of 80.5(12.5) for females in the Low group and 80.5 (12.5) instead of 87.3 (12.1) for males in the High group. The correct Table 1 is shown in the erratum.] Recently, individuals with autistic traits, especially female, have been known to use compensatory strategies (e.g. hiding their autistic traits or compensatory learning) for better adaptation. Though these strategies are predicted to be relevant with the non-clinical undiagnosed autistic people, their adaptive status and the factor contributing to it remain largely unexplored, especially the influence of gender. We explored the strengths of non-clinical adults with high autistic traits (high, N = 89, scored 19 or higher on Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire: ASSQ, self- and/or other-ratings) who were respondents to an online survey recruited from all over Japan, using items of the personal strengths in the Adult Self Report (ASR) and Adult Behavior Checklist (rating by others). We compared the high group with the low autistic traits group (low, N = 408, less than 19 on both ASSQ self- and other-ratings on the online survey) and the autism spectrum disorder group (ASD, N = 50, initial visit to hospital), as well as by gender. Personal strengths estimated by others were significantly higher than those by self in the high group, especially in females, but were opposite in the ASD group and equivalent in the low group, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that personal strengths estimated by others increased adaptive functioning, with worsening of internalizing symptoms in high group females, both of which were assessed using ASR. Thus, non-clinical autistic females appeared to have unique adaptation styles.

Absolute and relative gender differences in physical inactivity were calculated by subtracting and dividing the prevalence of physical inactivity among men from women’s prevalence, respectively. Physical inactivity accounts for 12.25% cases of dementia in LLMIC. Women account for 58% of deaths and 56% of DALY’s due to dementia in LLMIC. Adjusted prevalence of dementia was associated with prevalence and absolute gender difference in physical inactivity.

Barriers and facilitators to adopting healthier lifestyle among low‐income women in saudi arabia: A qualitative study,"Alageel, Samah; Alhujaili, Maysa; Altwaijri, Yasmin; Bilal, Lisa; Alsukait, Reem","Introduction Low socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with increased levels of obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity leading to a higher risk of chronic diseases. This study aimed to explore low SES women's barriers and facilitators to engaging in a healthy lifestyle and their accounts in developing future behaviour change interventions. Methods Qualitative study using focus group interviews informed by the Capability Opportunity Motivation—Behavior (COM‐B) framework. Interviews were conducted with a convenience sample, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. This study is conducted in partnership with Alnahda Society, a prominent nongovernmental organization in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Results We conducted five focus groups with a total of 29 participants. We identified five overarching themes from the data related to participants' definition of a ‘healthy life’, the difficulties they face that hinder their engagement with a healthy lifestyle, the methods and reasons for changing health behaviour and participants' views of an ideal future behaviour change intervention. Women's definition of a healthy lifestyle did not only include a healthy diet and physical activity but also emphasized the importance of improving mental wellness. Following a healthy lifestyle, although desired, is not always a priority for women with low SES due to the high cost, lack of availability of healthy options and time constraints. Many women in our sample discussed the need to have a routine and discipline to follow and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Family members' support for behaviour change was discussed as a facilitator to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Women highlighted several reasons that would motivate them to change their health behaviour, including having or preventing health conditions, improving mental health, and managing weight. Participants also discussed the characteristics of an ideal behaviour change intervention. Discussion This study suggests that women with low SES are faced with several barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle. Behaviour change intervention targeting this population needs to be tailored to address these barriers and facilitate behaviour change for people with limited resources. National policies to improve the availability and affordability of healthy options are also needed to reduce health disparities. Patient and Public Contributions Women of low SES who took part in the study were given a chance at the end of each focus group discussion to reflect on the questions and add any areas important to them that were not covered during the interview.

Battles through and about statistics in French pay equity bargaining: The politics of quantification at workplace level,"Pochic, Sophie; Chappe, Vincent‐Arnaud","This article proposes to study the discreet ‘battles of numbers’ at workplace level, particularly exacerbated on pay equity, in relation to its potential additional costs for employers. Figures are at once a framework, an object and a resource for power struggles between social partners. This approach is inspired by ‘statactivism’, a research perspective that studies the ways and contexts in which statistics can become tools for social mobilization. In a European context where bargaining is increasingly decentralized to company level, we argue that researchers should pay attention to statistical resources and quantification skills of negotiators, both on the management and unions side.

BB see: Transparency legislation and public discussions of wage inequality,"Treleaven, Christina; Fuller, Sylvia","Disparities in compensation persist between men and women. Wage transparency, which enables workers to compare their compensation to what others receive in their organization, can be an important tool for redressing specific intra‐firm disparities tied to discriminatory processes. Drawing on newspaper reports about gender pay differentials, we provide the first analysis of whether a public disclosure of pay transparency corresponds to a shift in broader public discourse, as represented by news coverage. Thematic analysis of newspaper coverage of the gender pay gap in Britain before and after the high‐profile release of BBC wage data in 2017 reveals a shift from choice‐based explanations to those emphasizing structural inequality and discrimination. The findings suggest that wage transparency coupled with news media attention may not only identify inequitable pay in firms, but also work more broadly to create space to discuss discriminatory practices and redress for pay disparities.

Board gender diversity and within-firm wage inequity: Evidence from the relaxation of china’s one-child policy,"Qin, Ni; Kong, Dongmin; Zhu, Ling; Xiong, Mengxu","This study examines whether and how board gender diversity can affect corporate wage inequity by drawing on diversity theory and gender socialization and ethicality theories. Building on an exogenous relaxation of China’s one-child policy (OCP) in 2013, which led to a substantial decline in the female labor force participation rate. Our empirical analysis suggests that board gender diversity is negatively associated with corporate wage inequity. This result is robust to various endogeneity and sensitivity analyses. We find that the OCP relaxation only increases average executive pay; it does not affect employee pay. One potential mechanism driving our results is that the decline in board gender diversity caused by the OCP relaxation reduces supervision, restriction, and fairness within the firm, which increases executives’ pursuit of personal interests and ultimately leads to the rise of wage inequity. Our findings are particularly significant for firms in capital-intensive industries, firms with a low level of employee bargaining power, and large firms.

Can sex influence the neurocognition of language? Evidence from Parkinson's disease,"Reifegerste, Jana; Estabrooke, Ivy V.; Russell, Lauren E.; Veríssimo, João; Johari, Karim; Wilmarth, Barbara; Pagan, Fernando L.; Moussa, Charbel; Ullman, Michael T.","Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves basal ganglia degeneration, affects language as well as motor function. However, which aspects of language are impaired in PD and under what circumstances remains unclear. We examined whether lexical and grammatical aspects of language are differentially affected in PD, and whether this dissociation is moderated by sex as well as the degree of basal ganglia degeneration. Our predictions were based on the declarative/procedural model of language. The model posits that grammatical composition, including in regular inflection, depends importantly on left basal ganglia procedural memory circuits, whereas irregular and other lexicalized forms are memorized in declarative memory. Since females tend to show declarative memory advantages as compared to males, the model further posits that females should tend to rely on this system for regulars, which can be stored as lexicalized chunks. We tested non-demented male and female PD patients and healthy control participants on the intensively studied paradigm of English regular and irregular past-tense production. Mixed-effects regression revealed PD deficits only at regular inflection, only in male patients. The degree of left basal ganglia degeneration, as reflected by right-side hypokinesia, predicted only regular inflection, and only in male patients. Left-side hypokinesia did not show this pattern. Past-tense frequency effects suggested that the female patients retrieved regular as well as irregular past-tense forms from declarative memory, whereas the males retrieved only irregulars. Sensitivity analyses showed that the pattern of findings was robust. The results, which are consistent with the declarative/procedural model, suggest a grammatical deficit in PD due to left basal ganglia degeneration, with a relative sparing of lexical retrieval. Female patients appear to compensate for this deficit by relying on chunks stored in declarative memory. More generally, the study elucidates the neurocognition of inflectional morphology and provides evidence that sex can influence how language is computed in the mind and brain.

Cancer counseling of low-income limited english proficient latina women using medical interpreters: Implications for shared decision-making,"Kamara, Daniella; Weil, Jon; Youngblom, Janey; Guerra, Claudia; Joseph, Galen","In cancer genetic counseling (CGC), communication across language and culture challenges the model of practice based on shared decision-making. To date, little research has examined the decision-making process of low-income, limited English proficiency (LEP) patients in CGC. This study identified communication patterns in CGC sessions with this population and assessed how these patterns facilitate or inhibit the decision-making process during the sessions. We analyzed 24 audio recordings of CGC sessions conducted in Spanish via telephone interpreters at two public hospitals. Patients were referred for risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer; all were offered genetic testing. Audio files were coded by two bilingual English-Spanish researchers and analyzed using conventional content analysis through an iterative process. The 24 sessions included 13 patients, 6 counselors, and 18 interpreters. Qualitative data analyses identified three key domains – Challenges Posed by Hypothetical Explanations, Misinterpretation by the Medical Interpreter, and Communication Facilitators – that reflect communication patterns and their impact on the counselor’s ability to facilitate shared decision-making. Overall, we found an absence of patient participation in the decision-making process. Our data suggest that when counseling LEP Latina patients via medical interpreter, prioritizing information with direct utility for the patient and organizing information into short- and long-term goals may reduce information overload and improve comprehension for patient and interpreter. Further research is needed to test the proposed counseling strategies with this population and to assess how applicable our findings are to other populations.

Methods: Participants were 710 My Body My Test-3 clinical trial participants who were publicly insured or uninsured with incomes ≤250% of the U.S. Federal Poverty Level, aged 25–64 years, and not up to date on cervical cancer screening as per national guidelines. Using Health Belief Model constructs, we assessed screening-related knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors—overall and stratified by race and ethnicity—and estimated associations with past-year attempted screening using multivariable regression models. Results: Overall, knowledge was low about the human papillomavirus, purpose of a Pap test, and recommended screening interval. Perceived severity of cervical cancer was high (3.63 on a 4-point scale). Black and Latina/Hispanic women were more likely to perceive screening as lowering their risk of cervical cancer than White women. Black women reported lower perceived risk of cervical cancer compared with White women (p = 0.03), but Black women were more likely to have sought screening in the past year (p = 0.01). Having at least three doctor visits in the past year was associated with a screening attempt. Greater perceived risk of cervical cancer, more positive perceptions of screening, and feeling more nervousness about screening were also associated with a screening attempt (all p < 0.05).

Practitioners and researchers alike have been investigating the potential of social norms theory to inform the design of effective interventions addressing these practices in low- and middle-income countries. One approach commonly used to facilitate social norms change is community-based dialogs and trainings. This approach has often been criticized for not being cost-effective, as it usually includes a relatively small number of direct participants and does not allow for scaling-up strategies. In spite of some evidence (as for instance, the SASA! Program) that community dialogs can achieve social norms change, little exists in the literature about how exactly participants in community dialogs engage others in their networks to achieve change. In this paper, we look at the potential of 'organized diffusion' as a cost-effective strategy to expand the positive effects of community-based interventions to participants’ networks, achieving sustainable normative shifts. We provide quantitative evidence from three case studies—Community Empowerment Program in Mali, Change Starts at Home in Nepal, and Voices for Change in Nigeria—showing that participants in community-based interventions can be effectively empowered to share their new knowledge and understandings systematically with others in their networks, eventually facilitating social norms change. Future community-based interventions intending to achieve social norms change would benefit from integrating ways to help participants engage others in their network in transformative conversations. Doing so has the potential to generate additional impact with little additional investment.

"Community violence exposure, sleep disruption, and insulin resistance in low-income urban adolescents","Kliewer, Wendy; Robins, Jo Lynne; Borre, Alicia","Background: Exposure to violence, which is experienced at disproportionally higher levels by black versus white youth, is associated with disruptions in sleep and elevated cardiovascular risk. Further, poor sleep hygiene is associated with insulin resistance. However, research to date examining disruptions in sleep and cardiovascular risk in African-American adolescents has not taken the impact of exposure to violence into account, nor considered how gender might affect patterns of association. The present study addressed this gap by testing a path model linking exposure to community violence, sleep disruption, and insulin resistance in a sample of African-American adolescents and evaluating model fit across gender. Method: African-American adolescents (N = 107; 56% female; M age = 14.29, SD = 1.17) completed structured interviews at home and provided a blood sample after fasting overnight. Results: The model fit connecting exposure to violence with sleep disruption and insulin resistance, adjusting for depressive symptoms and body mass index z score, was excellent. Multiple group analysis indicated gender differences in model fit. Path analysis revealed significant positive associations between exposure to violence and sleep disruption and sleep disruption and insulin resistance for females but not males. Conclusion: These data indicate that low-income, urban African-American female adolescents who witness violence and experience sleep disruptions may already be at elevated risk for health problems compared with their male counterparts.

Consumption of a high-fat soup preload leads to differences in short-term energy and fat intake between PROP non-taster and super-taster women,"Shafaie, Yasmine; Hoffman, Daniel J.; Tepper, Beverly J.","Taste blindness to the bitterness of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) has been used as a genetic marker for food selection and adiposity. We have shown that PROP non-taster (NT) women have higher BMIs and habitually consume more fat and energy than either medium-taster (MT) or super-taster (ST) women. These data imply that differences in dietary selection underlie the body weight differences among PROP taster groups. However, no studies investigated energy compensation in women classified by PROP status. We investigated if NTs would compensate less accurately for the calories and fat in a high-fat soup preload in a subsequent test meal compared to MTs and STs. Energy intake from a buffet meal was measured in 75 healthy non-diet-restrained, lean women 30 min after the ingestion of a high-fat soup preload (0.8 kcal/ g; 55% calories from fat), calculated to represent 10% of resting energy expenditure for each subject, or the same volume of water. Subjects (n = 20–28/taster group) ate a standard breakfast followed 3 hr later by an ad-libitum buffet lunch, on two occasions. There were no differences in energy intake or macronutrient selection across taster groups after water. After soup, NTs consumed more energy than STs. Fat intake (as %-energy) was higher in NTs (46.4% ± 2.4) compared to either MTs (36.1 ± 1.9%) or STs (38.1% ± 2.3; p < 0.05).

Incorrect figures and tables were used in the original version of the article. The article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-77918-005[/rid]). Sexual motivation strongly influences mate choice and dating behavior and can be triggered by merely viewing sexually arousing visual images, such as erotic pictures and movies. Previous studies suggested that men, more than women, tend to search for sexual cues that signal promiscuity in short-term mates. However, it remains to be tested whether sex differences in the motivation to view sexual cues can be observed by using robust and well-controlled behavioral measures. To this end, we employed a pay-per-view key-pressing task. Japanese self-identified heterosexual male and female participants viewed images of men, women, or couples with two levels of sexual arousal (sexual vs. less sexual). Participants could alter the viewing time of a presented image according to their willingness to keep viewing it.

COVID-19 and gender differences in mental health in low- and middle-income countries: Young working women are more vulnerable,"Hossain, Mobarak","This study examines gender differences in the relationship between COVID-19-triggered economic hardship and mental health complaints, defined by self-reported anxiety/depression, of young people (17–29) in four low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To do this, we use two waves of the Young Lives (YL) phone survey. Logistic regression results show that young women, on average, were more likely to report anxiety than men in Peru and Vietnam in the first survey wave (June–July 2020). However, this disparity continued to persist in all four countries in the second wave (August–October 2020) as the pandemic prolonged. Notably, we find that young women that faced economic hardship by losing job or income were more likely to report anxiety than their male counterparts. As COVID-19 cases remain consistently high in many LMICs, which limit economic activities, the vulnerability of young women may likely increase. This issue requires urgent policy attention by awareness-raising campaigns, more hotline services for emergency help, social security programs for women, and available women's sexual and reproductive health services at a specific section in hospitals.

Cracking IT: Negotiating working-class gender capital through group enterprises in India,"Arun, Shoba; Arun, Thankom","Digital work is often associated with higher levels of earning and increased social mobility. Working in the digital economy will not benefit all women equally or act as an enabler of broader social change. The article draws attention to the intersection of gender and class in work in the information technology (IT) sector of India, where women have increased their visibility and participation. Through a gender capital approach and intersectional analyses, the article points to the incontrovertible impact of class and gender when women from low-income backgrounds engage in IT-based group enterprises in the state of Kerala. A central insight from the study is the need to disaggregate types of IT work as women’s experiences in IT are shaped by the simultaneity of working practices, intersectional inequalities and gendered behaviours, often with limits to gender capital and spill-over impact on broader gender and social relations.

Developing and implementing global gender policy to reduce HIV and AIDS in low- and middle -income countries: Policy makers’ perspectives,"Olinyk, Shannon; Gibbs, Andrew; Campbell, Catherine","Gender inequalities have been recognised as central to the HIV epidemic for many years. In response, a range of gender policies have been developed in attempts to mitigate the impact and transform gender relations. However, the effects of these policies have been less than successful. In March 2010 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launched the Agenda for accelerated country level action on women, girls, gender equality and HIV (the Agenda), an operational plan on how to integrate women, girls and gender equality into the HIV response. This paper explores the perspectives of those involved in developing and implementing the Agenda to understand its strengths and limitations. In-depth one-on-one interviews were conducted with 16 individuals involved in the development and implementation of the Agenda. The data were analysed using thematic network analysis. Facilitators of the Agenda centred on the Agenda's ability to create political space for women and girls within the global HIV/AIDS response and the collaborative process of developing the Agenda. Barriers to the implementation and development of the Agenda include the limited financial and non-financial resources, the top-down nature of the Agenda's development and implementation and a lack of political will from within UNAIDS to implement it. We suggest that the Agenda achieved many goals, but its effect was constrained by a wide range of factors.

Differences between males and females in the prediction of smartphone use while driving: Mindfulness and income,"Kita, Erez; Luria, Gil","Introduction: This study examines the relationship between two variables–mindfulness and income–with regards to their relationship to the use of smartphones by young drivers, which has been known to increase the likelihood of car accidents, endangering young drivers and other road users. The study focuses on the relationship between these variables and the use of smartphones while driving, and how this relationship differs between males and females. Method: The study sample included 221 young drivers who were legally permitted to drive without supervision. The subjects were first asked to complete questionnaires on mindfulness and income. Next, their smartphone use while driving was monitored over a one-month period. This study is unique as it used an objective smartphone monitoring application (rather than self-reporting) to count the number of times the young participants actually touched their smartphones while driving. Results: The findings show that the effects of social and personal factors (i.e., income and mindfulness) on the use of smartphones while driving are significant for males but not for females. Conclusions: Most studies that investigate differences between males and females with respect to safety focus on differences in the averages of safety-related variables (such as safety performance and outcomes). In the current study, however, we identified differences in relationships between variables and demonstrated that what predicts safety-related behavior in males may not be a good predictor for females. Practical applications: Mindfulness and income can be used to identify male populations that are at risk of using smartphones while driving. Interventions that improve mindfulness can be used to reduce the use of smartphones by male drivers.

Methods: The 2013 national survey regarding alcohol use among Japanese adults was utilized. The results from 1193 men and 1503 women aged 20–64 years were included in the analysis. Education attainment, household income, marital status, working status, and occupation were adopted as SES determinants. Binomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of HD and HED for each SES group. Results: ORs (95% confidence intervals) of HD were higher among persons with less education among both men [1.61 (1.18–2.20)] and women [1.78 (1.19–2.67)]. The OR of HED in men was significantly higher among those who belonged to high household income, were married, and managers or professionals. The OR of HED among women was higher in persons who were employed, as compared with those who engaged in housework. There were no correlations between HED and educational background. Conclusions: This study showed that in Japan, a lower educational background for both men and women was associated with a higher risk for HD, while higher current SES for men and working women were associated with a higher risk for HED. It is necessary to recognize the SES differences between HD and HED to achieve a policy to reduce alcohol-related harm.

Methods: Nine indicators associated with social disadvantage were analysed from the 2002 to 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: education, annual family income, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, serious psychological distress, health insurance, public assistance, and employment status. Using descriptive and multivariable analyses, we measured trends in smoking overall and within the assessed variables. We also evaluated effect of interactions on disparities and estimated the excess number of smokers attributable to disparities. Results: During 2002–2016, current cigarette smoking prevalence declined overall (27.5%–20.7%; p trend < 0.01), and among all subgroups except Medicare insurees and American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Overall inequalities in cigarette smoking grew even wider or remained unchanged for several indicators during the study period. In 2016, comparing groups with the least versus the most social advantage, the single largest disparity in current smoking prevalence was seen by race/ethnicity (prevalence ratio = 5.1, AI/ANs vs Asians). Education differences alone explained 38.0% of the observed racial/ethnic disparity in smoking prevalence. Interactions were also present; compared with the population-averaged prevalence among all AI/AN individuals (34.0%), prevalence was much higher among AI/ANs with <high school diploma (53.0%), unemployed (58.0%), or with serious psychological distress (66.9%). The burden of smoking attributable to race/ethnic disparities in smoking prevalence was an estimated 27.6 million smokers. Conclusions: Overall smoking inequality increased or remained unchanged because of slower declines in smoking prevalence among disadvantaged groups.

Do gender wage differences within households influence women's empowerment and welfare? Evidence from Ghana,"Danquah, Michael; Iddrisu, Abdul Malik; Boakye, Ernest Owusu; Owusu, Solomon","Using household data from the latest wave of the Ghana Living Standards Survey, this paper utilizes machine learning techniques – IV LASSO – that allows for the treatment of unconfoundedness in the selection of observables and unobservables to examine the structural effect of gender wage differences within households on women's empowerment and welfare in Ghana. The structural parameters of the IV LASSO estimations show that a reduction in household gender wage gap significantly enhances women's empowerment. Also, a decline in household gender wage gap results meaningfully in improving household and women's welfare. Particularly, the increasing effect on women's welfare resulting from decreases in household gender wage differences is much higher than for the household welfare. The findings showcase the need to vigorously adopt policies that both increase the quantity and quality of jobs for women and address gender barriers that inhibit women from accessing these jobs opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa.

We have studied predation of the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) by the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor) in farmland habitats in western Poland. Shrike caches were used as a source of information about preyed lizards. Shrikes hunt significantly more adult males than females, juveniles and sub-adults; the pattern was similar over all three study years. Male lizard had longer activity time than female; therefore, they seem to be under predation pressure for a longer time during breeding season. Capture and count transect data of common lizard populations living within and outside shrike territories showed significant seasonal differences: within shrike territories, there was lower proportion of males than females; moreover, in some territories, the number of males in the lizard population was negatively correlated with the number of males impaled by shrikes. Our findings suggest that in this particular predator-prey system, shrikes may be a strong selective force for lizards’ population dynamics. Male-biased predation could be caused by differences in the behaviour of adult male and female lizards, namely longer activity of males and differences in space and refuge use.

Methods: We pooled data from 10 consecutive years (2008 to 2017) of the National Health Interview Survey. We used logistic regression to assess the extent to which the effect of race on meeting the U.S. federal guidelines for PA varies by sex, income, education, and region, after controlling for several health-related variables. The analysis sample size was 225,600 (102,348 men and 123,252 women). Results: Race and most of the other covariates interacted with sex in their effect on meeting PA guidelines; therefore, separate models for men and women were estimated. In each model, race interacted with income and region, but not with education. Among men, Blacks were more likely to meet PA guidelines than Whites in nearly all income categories and regions. The race effect was weakest among the poor and in the Northeast region. Among women, Blacks were generally less likely than Whites to meet the guidelines and the race effect was largest among the poor and in the Northeast region. Conclusion: This study showed that the difference between Blacks and Whites in the extent to which they adhere to federal PA guidelines varies by sex, income, and region of residence.

"Education, income and occupation and their influence on the uptake of cervical cancer prevention strategies: A systematic review","Murfin, Jessica; Irvine, Fiona; Meechan‐Rogers, Ronnie; Swift, Amelia","Aims: To report a systematic review of the literature exploring how education, income and occupation influence the uptake of cervical screening and HPV vaccination among eligible women in developed countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Germany and Norway. Background: Cervical cancer remains a highly prevalent disease despite it being largely preventable through cervical screening and HPV vaccination. Incidence and mortality of cervical cancer are unequally distributed among socioeconomic groups, warranting research into how individual socioeconomic factors contribute to this unbalanced uptake of prevention strategies. Design: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines (PLoS Medicine, 6, 2009, e1000097) guided the selection of papers. MEDLINE, CINHAL, PsychINFO, Science Citation Index and HMIC were searched. Ten articles were suitable. Key findings were then extracted, and a narrative synthesis was completed, using suitable guidance and the AXIS tool. Results: Obtaining high school or college education is associated with uptake of both cervical screening and HPV vaccination. Total household income and income in respect of the countries' poverty line was measured less frequently than education, but associated with screening and vaccination in some studies. Occupation was infrequently measured in comparison to education and income, limiting conclusions of its association to uptake. Conclusion: Education and income have an association with uptake of cervical screening and HPV vaccination among women. However, evidence is insufficient to affirm a relationship between occupation and uptake of screening and vaccination. Further research would be advised to strengthen these findings. Relevance to clinical practice: Interventions to promote cervical cancer prevention strategies should be targeted at women and girls with lower education levels and lower income. However, differences are displayed in the relationships between the individual socioeconomic factors and uptake of preventative strategies between countries and populations and so they should be considered separately. Nurses play a considerable role in people's perceptions and experiences of cervical screening and HPV vaccination.

Educational and wealth inequalities in tobacco use among men and women in 54 low-income and middle-income countries,"Sreeramareddy, Chandrashekhar T.; Harper, Sam; Ernstsen, Linda","Background: Socioeconomic differentials of tobacco smoking in high-income countries are well described. However, studies to support health policies and place monitoring systems to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and smokeless tobacco use common in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) are seldom reported. We aimed to describe, sex-wise, educational and wealth-related inequalities in tobacco use in LMICs. Methods: We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data on tobacco use collected from large nationally representative samples of men and women in 54 LMICs. We estimated the weighted prevalence of any current tobacco use (including smokeless tobacco) in each country for 4 educational groups and 4 wealth groups. We calculated absolute and relative measures of inequality, that is, the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII), which take into account the distribution of prevalence across all education and wealth groups and account for population size. We also calculated the aggregate SII and RII for low-income (LIC), lower-middle-income (lMIC) and upper-middle-income (uMIC) countries as per World Bank classification. Findings: Male tobacco use was highest in Bangladesh (70.3%) and lowest in Sao Tome (7.4%), whereas female tobacco use was highest in Madagascar (21%) and lowest in Tajikistan (0.22%). Among men, educational inequalities varied widely between countries, but aggregate RII and SII showed an inverse trend by country wealth groups. RII was 3.61 (95% CI 2.83 to 4.61) in LICs, 1.99 (95% CI 1.66 to 2.38) in lMIC and 1.82 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.67) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among men varied less between countries, but RII and SII showed an inverse pattern where RII was 2.43 (95% CI 2.05 to 2.88) in LICs, 1.84 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.21) in lMICs and 1.67 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.42) in uMICs. For educational inequalities among women, the RII varied much more than SII varied between the countries, and the aggregate RII was 14.49 (95% CI 8.87 to 23.68) in LICs, 3.05 (95% CI 1.44 to 6.47) in lMIC and 1.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 7.56) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among women showed a pattern similar to that of men: the RII was 5.88 (95% CI 3.91 to 8.85) in LICs, 1.76 (95% CI 0.80 to 3.85) in lMIC and 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.64) in uMIC. In contrast to men, among women, the SII was pro-rich (higher smoking among the more advantaged) in 13 of the 52 countries (7 of 23 lMIC and 5 of 7 uMIC). Interpretation: Our results confirm that socioeconomic inequalities tobacco use exist in LMIC, varied widely between the countries and were much wider in the lowest income countries.

"Educational assortative mating, gender equality, and income differentiation across Europe: A simulation study","Eeckhaut, Mieke C. W.; Stanfors, Maria A.","Demographic explanations for the rise in household income inequality include increased educational assortative mating and changes in the division of paid labour within families. Building on this research, the current study focuses on the connected nature of these two inequality-producing mechanisms, while at the same time bridging the divide with the economic literature on the role of income differentiation. Drawing on the 2004–2008 European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we consider variation across Europe in the disequalising effect of educational assortative mating and relate these patterns to the general characteristics of welfare state regimes, focusing on the degree of gender equality and income differentiation. First, we document large educational differentials in men’s and women’s income in Eastern Europe, and smaller differentials in Anglo-Saxon, Continental and, especially, Northern Europe. Next, we find that this variation in gender equality and income differentiation parallels variation in the potential contribution of educational assortative mating to educational differentiation in household income.

"Effects of maternal and paternal postnatal depressive symptoms on infants’ parasympathetic regulation in low‐income, Mexican American families","Lin, Betty; Yeo, Anna J.; Luecken, Linda J.; Roubinov, Danielle S.","Mothers and fathers are at elevated risk for developing depression during the first postnatal year, especially among families from marginalized communities. Although a number of studies demonstrate that exposure to maternal depressive symptoms can undermine infants’ regulatory development, less is known about the extent to which paternal depressive symptoms may also contribute. The current study investigated whether maternal and paternal depressive symptoms were uniquely associated with infants’ physiological regulation, and whether associations varied depending on infant sex. Participants included 90 low‐income Mexican American families. Fathers and mothers self‐reported their depressive symptoms when infants were 15 weeks old, and infants’ resting parasympathetic activity (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) was assessed at 6 and 24 weeks. Results indicated that, after controlling for infant 6‐week RSA and depressive symptoms in the other parent, paternal depressive symptoms were associated with lower 24‐week RSA for both girls and boys, but maternal depressive symptoms were only associated with lower 24‐week RSA for boys. Findings highlight a potential mechanism through which the consequences of parent depressive symptoms may reverberate across generations, and suggest that considerations of both infants’ and parents’ sex may lend insight into how best to intervene.

Egalitarian norm messaging increases human resources professionals’ salary offers to women,"Schuster, Carolin; Sparkman, Gregg; Walton, Gregory M.; Alles, Anna; Loschelder, David D.","Across the globe, men make markedly more money than women, even within the same position. We introduce egalitarian norm messaging as a potential intervention to increase women’s salaries and counter the gender pay gap. In two preregistered experiments with seasoned professionals (N = 435, work experience: M > 8 years, salary negotiations: M > 18 per year), we find a significant gender pay bias—Human Resources (HR) experts offered markedly lower salaries in an online negotiation to (simulated) female versus male candidates with identical qualifications. Moreover, the experiments show that dynamic (Experiments 1a and 2), as well as static egalitarian norm messages (Experiment 1a), increased salary offers to women. Exploratory mediation analyses suggest that the dynamic egalitarian norm effect was driven by HR professionals’ feeling of working toward a shared goal of greater equity. A message that merely increased awareness of the pay gap did not elicit this feeling and did not significantly increase salary offers to women but resulted in fairly equal treatment of men and women (Experiment 2). While the egalitarian norm intervention significantly increased salary offers to women, it also unexpectedly reduced offers to men, thereby reversing the gender bias (Experiment 2). We discuss the theoretical contribution with regard to gender pay bias and egalitarian norm interventions, as well as applied implications.

Methods: In the context of a Community Based Participatory Research collaboration, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of the Health Research Engagement Intervention with pre- and post-intervention surveys (n = 133). The primary outcome was health research information-seeking behavior. Secondary outcomes were health research knowledge, willingness to participate in health research, and health empowerment. Qualitative interviews (n = 11) elucidated participant perspectives on the intervention. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups’ information-seeking behavior. Knowledge that not all health research studies are about drugs or treatments increased significantly from pre- to post-test among intervention group participants (32% to 48%, p = 0.012), but not in the control group (43% to 30%, p = 0.059); the difference between arms was statistically significant (p = 0.0012).

Equality through innovation: Promoting women in the workplace in low‐ and middle‐income countries with health information technology,"Asi, Yara M.; Williams, Cynthia","Technological innovation has served as a useful catalyst for development goals across sectors, from agriculture to education. Various forms of health information technology (HIT), such as mobile health and telemedicine, have been used globally to support health care delivery systems. Forms of HIT, developed primarily by men in rich countries, are touted to support all patients and providers. However, while women perform most global health delivery, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC), they have less access to technology. Stakeholders have been slow to recognize and resolve conflicts about how technology affects gender disparities, especially in health care. In this paper, we describe, using a social capital framework, how integrating HIT in health systems can empower women in the health care workforce. We conclude with policy recommendations that can support women in the health care workforce through HIT.

"Evidence for quantity–quality trade-offs, sex-specific parental investment, and variance compensation in colonized Agta foragers undergoing demographic transition","Ross, Cody T.; Borgerhoff Mulder, Monique; Winterhalder, Bruce; Uehara, Ray; Headland, Janet; Headland, Thomas","Evolutionary ecological models of human fertility predict that: (1) parents will bias investment toward the sex with the highest fitness prospects in a particular socio-ecological context; (2) fertility is subject to quantity–quality trade-offs; and (3) fertility decisions will be sensitive to both predictable and stochastic mortality risk and the relative fitness value of differently sized sib-sets (the variance compensation hypothesis). We test these predictions using demographic records from the Agta, an indigenous population from the Philippines, who, as a result of disruption by loggers, miners, and settlers, are undergoing a demographic and social/ecological transition from foragers to peasant laborers. Leveraging the spatial and temporal variation in the Agta Demographic Database, we conduct an analysis of Agta life-history traits across this transition. Specifically, we compare the Casiguran Agta (CA) with the more isolated peninsular San Ildefonso Agta (SIA) sub-population from before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) encroachment. We find: (1) evidence of a decline in overall survival from phase 1 to phase 2, coupled with increased parental investment in first-born daughters compared to first-born sons in the CA population, and increased parental investment in sons versus daughters in the SIA population; (2) evidence of a moderate quantity–quality trade-off in CA and SIA fertility in phase 1; and (3) support for predictions of the variance compensation hypothesis as a driver of the lowered relative fertility in the CA. Our customized methods, comparative framework, and simultaneous focus on fertility and mortality allow us to show how heterogeneity in mortality and fertility are linked to life history trade-offs and environmental context in a manner consistent with the predictions of evolutionary ecological models.

Explaining wage differentials by field of study among higher education graduates: Evidence from a large-scale survey of adult skills,"Bol, Thijs; Heisig, Jan Paul","Why do some fields of study in higher education yield higher wage returns in the labor market than others? Human capital perspectives suggest that differences in skills are a major source of between-fields wage differentials. We assess this explanation using data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Our pooled analysis of 17,590 graduates from 29 countries indicates that differences in general cognitive (literacy and numeracy) skills matter relatively little, although numeracy skills do play a meaningful role in accounting for the high wages of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduates. Specific skills, proxied by skill use on the job, explain a substantial portion of between-field wage differentials. Remarkably, we find that the sex composition of the field of study remains important after taking skills into account, particularly for explaining the wage advantage of STEM graduates. Comparative analyses grouping the 29 countries into four institutional clusters—Social-democratic, Conservative, Liberal, and Post-communist—show that these general patterns are broadly similar across different institutional contexts.

Exploring differences between adolescents and adults with perinatal depression—data from the expanding care for perinatal women with depression trial in Nigeria,"Oladeji, Bibilola D.; Bello, Toyin; Kola, Lola; Araya, Ricardo; Zelkowitz, Phyllis; Gureje, Oye","Background: Depression is common among women in the perinatal period. Although pregnancy and motherhood among adolescents are global public health issues, little is known about how adolescents differ from adults in the occurrence and correlates of perinatal depression. Methods: Data were derived from a cluster randomized controlled trial of psychosocial interventions for perinatal depression in primary maternal care in Nigeria (the Expanding Care for Perinatal Women with Depression trial). Adolescents and adult participants recruited during pregnancy and followed up till 6-month postpartum were compared: proportions with depression [screening positive to depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (score ≥ 12) and meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria using the short form of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview]; adjustment and attitude to pregnancy and motherhood (using the Maternal Adjustment and Maternal Attitudes scale); and parenting skills (measured on Infant–Toddler version of the Home Inventory for Measurement of the Environment). Infant and fetal growth were assessed by measures of weight and head circumference at birth and upper mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) at 6 months. Results: Of 8,580 adults screened, 6.9% had major depression compared with 17.7% of 772 screened adolescents (p < 0.001). Adolescents had significantly poorer adjustment and attitudes to pregnancy, lower mean fetal gestational age at birth, and a smaller mean baby’s birth weight. At 6-month postpartum, there were no significant differences in the rates of remission from depression between adolescent and adult women (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score <6). Adolescent mothers continued to have poorer maternal attitudes and parenting skills indicated by significantly lower scores on the Infant–Toddler version of the Home Inventory for Measurement of the Environment responsivity and involvement subscales. Infants of adolescent mothers had a higher rate of undernutrition (defined as MUAC < 12.5 cm) compared with those of adult mothers: 14.8 and 6.3%, respectively (p = 0.008), with the mean MUAC remaining significantly lower for infants of adolescent mothers after adjusting for their lower birth weight (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Perinatal depression is more common and is associated with poorer maternal attitudes and parenting skills in adolescents compared with those in adults. Evidence from this exploratory study suggests that in improving outcomes in infants of adolescent mothers with perinatal depression, depression treatment may need to be supplemented with specific approaches to improve parenting skills.

Face mask use conditionally decreases compliance with physical distancing rules against COVID-19: Gender differences in risk compensation pattern,"Aranguren, Martin","Background: In the context of the COVID-19 emergency, the concern has been raised that people may compensate the reduction in risk ensured by mask use with an increase in risk induced by lower adherence to physical distancing rules. Purpose The paper investigates if people compensate risk in this manner when their interaction partner wears a face mask, examining if risk compensation further depends on gender, signaled social status and perceived race. Methods: An experiment was conducted in two waves (June, n = 1396 and September 2020, n = 1326) in front of the traffic lights of four busy roads in Paris. A confederate asked a randomly selected pedestrian for directions following a script and keeping the recommended distance. Confederates were locally recognizable as Blacks or Whites and alternatively presented themselves with a costume indicative of high or low social status. An observer recorded whether the pedestrian kept the recommended distance. Results: Both in June and September, men are less likely to comply with the distancing rule when the confederate wears the face mask, and particularly so when the confederate signals high status. When the confederate wears the mask, female pedestrians observe less the one-meter rule in September than in June. Conclusions: Men’s risk compensatory behavior is constant over time. In contrast, women’s depends on the time period. People keep shorter interpersonal distances when the interaction partner wears a face mask; the tendency is stable for men but depends on time for women.

Gender differences in emotion expression in low-income adolescents under stress,"Panjwani, Naaila; Chaplin, Tara M.; Sinha, Rajita; Mayes, Linda C.","Gender roles in mainstream US culture suggest that girls express more happiness, sadness, anxiety, and shame/embarrassment than boys, while boys express more anger and externalizing emotions, such as contempt. However, gender roles and emotion expression may be different in low-income and ethnically diverse families, as children and parents are often faced with greater environmental stressors and may have different gender expectations. This study examined gender differences in emotion expression in low-income adolescents, an understudied population. One hundred and seventy nine adolescents (aged 14–17) participated in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Trained coders rated adolescents’ expressions of happiness, sadness, anxiety, shame/embarrassment, anger, and contempt during the TSST using a micro-analytic coding system. Analyses showed that, consistent with gender roles, girls expressed higher levels of happiness and shame than boys; however, contrary to traditional gender roles, girls showed higher levels of contempt than boys. Also, in contrast to cultural stereotypes, there were no differences in anger between boys and girls.

Gender differences in reactions to injustice,"Khoreva, Violetta; Tenhiälä, Aino","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine gender differences in reactions to pay inequity and procedural justice. Specifically, the study seeks to reveal whether these gender differences can be explained by pay comparisons and knowledge of pay. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze survey data that were combined with archival pay data representing a sample of 416 employees of two universities in Finland. Findings: Male employees were found to be more sensitive toward pay inequity than female employees. In contrast, procedural justice was more strongly related to the organizational commitment of female than that of male employees. These effects were partly explained by pay comparisons and knowledge of pay. While male employees were more likely to compare their pay with some external referents, female employees were more likely to compare their pay internally. Male employees were somewhat more familiar with the pay system. Differences in these variables relate to organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications: Given the cross-sectional nature of the study, we encourage future research to look into how gender differences in reactions to injustice evolve over time. Originality/value: The study provides evidence that female employees react to a lesser extent to pay disparities by continuing to show high commitment toward their organizations. This paradox could be diminished by ensuring that all employees have the same amount of information regarding pay, such as how their pay compares to other referent groups.

Gender differences in the associations between informal caregiving and wellbeing in low- and middle-income countries,"Bhan, Nandita; Rao, Namratha; Raj, Anita","Background: Health risks among informal caregivers have received inadequate attention in low and middle income countries. We examined cross-sectional data from 28611 adults 18 years and older in Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa in the WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) to examine gender differences in informal caregiving and wellbeing. Methods: Wellbeing was measured by self-rated health, difficulties with tasks, self-reported and diagnosed depression and anxiety. Informal caregiving was specific to adults and constructed as categorical variable with the respondent as: the main caregiver, non-caregiver but an adult in the household needs care, and no-one ill in the household; multinomial gender-stratified regression models assessed adjusted relative risk ratios (ARRRs). Results: Female caregivers were more likely to report moderate difficulties with life tasks [ARRR = 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.08)], feel mild-moderate anxiety [ARRR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.22)], and report feeling severely depressed [ARRR = 1.86 (95% CI: 1.28, 2.69)] compared to female non-caregivers. Even when women were not caregivers, having someone ill at home was associated with extreme difficulties with life tasks [ARRR = 2.32 (95% CI: 1.33, 4.04)].

Gender differences in the effects of community violence on mental health outcomes in a sample of low-income youth receiving psychiatric care,"Javdani, Shabnam; Abdul-Adil, Jaleel; Suarez, Liza; Nichols, Sara R.; Farmer, A. David","Previous research suggests that community violence impacts mental health outcomes, but much of this research has not (a) distinguished between different types of community violence, (b) examined gender differences, and (c) focused on youth living in urban poverty. The current study addresses these questions. Participants were 306 youth (23 % girls) and one parent/guardian receiving outpatient psychiatric services for disruptive behavior disorders in a large urban city. Youth and parents reported on youth’s experience of different types of community violence (being a direct victim, hearing reports, and witnessing violence), and whether violence was directed toward a stranger or familiar. Outcomes included youth externalizing, internalizing, and posttraumatic stress symptoms assessed via parent and youth reports. Being a direct victim of violence accords risk for all mental health outcomes similarly for both boys and girls. However, gender differences emerged with respect to indirect violence, such that girls who hear reports of violence against people they know are at increased risk for all assessed mental health outcomes, and girls who witness violence against familiars are at increased risk for externalizing mental health symptoms in particular. There are gender differences in violence-related mental health etiology, with implications for intervention assessment and design.

When the choice is framed as a willingness-to-pay (WTP) task, men are willing to pay more and thus exhibit lower risk aversion. However, when the choice is framed as a willingness to accept task, women will not accept less than men. These findings imply gender differences in the endowment effect.

Gender disparities in access and retention in outpatient methadone treatment for opioid use disorder in low-income urban communities,"Marsh, Jeanne C.; Amaro, Hortensia; Kong, Yinfei; Khachikian, Tenie; Guerrero, Erick","The purpose of this study was to detect and understand gender disparities in access and retention among outpatient methadone treatment programs located in low-income urban communities in Los Angeles, California. The study collected client- and program-level data in 4 waves in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 from 34 publicly funded methadone treatment programs serving 11,169 clients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The sample included 29.8% female and 70.2% male clients, where 10.6% identified as Black or African American, 41.5% as Latino, 44.2% as non-Latino white, and 3.8% as Other. We conducted two multilevel negative binomial regression models to examine direct and moderated relationships related to both access (days on the waitlist) and retention (days in treatment) while accounting for clients clustered within programs. Gender disparities existed in both access and retention where women spent more time than men waiting to enter treatment but then remained in treatment longer. Further, female clients identifying as African American, Latino, and Other were at greater risk for shorter treatment duration than those who identified as non-Latino white and men. Overall, OUD clients receiving methadone treatment in low-income neighborhoods experienced barriers to access and retention in treatment associated with mental illness, family responsibilities, and use severity. OUD clients with MediCal insurance eligibility were consistently more likely to gain access to and remain in methadone treatment. Overall, findings call for improving treatment access and retention for women with OUD who receive methadone in outpatient methadone treatment programs through comprehensive, gender-specific, and evidence-based programming.

Gender in the markets for expertise,"de Vaan, Mathijs; Stuart, Toby","Stratification in professional careers arises in part from interpersonal dynamics in client-expert dyads. To reduce perceived uncertainty in judgments of the quality of experts, clients may rely on ascriptive characteristics of experts and on pairwise, relational factors to assess the advice they receive. Two such characteristics, expert gender and client-expert gender concordance, may lead to differences in clients’ trust in expert advice. To explore these issues, we investigate the incidence of patient-initiated second opinions (SOs) in medicine. In an examination of millions of medical claims in Massachusetts, we find that male patients are much more likely than female patients to obtain an SO if the first specialist they consult is female. Moreover, when the first specialist a patient consults is gender non-concordant and the patient seeks an SO, male patients are substantially more likely to switch to a same-gender specialist in the SO visit. Because patients who lack confidence in the advice of the first-seen specialist infrequently return to this specialist for medical services, female specialists generate lower billings. Analyses of medical spending in follow-up visits suggest that gendered patterns in questioning the advice of medical experts have the potential to contribute substantially to the gender pay gap in medicine.

"Gender norms and social norms: Differences, similarities and why they matter in prevention science","Cislaghi, Beniamino; Heise, Lori","Two streams of theory and practice on gender equity have begun to elide. The first is work conducted to change social norms, particularly using theory that emerged from studies in social psychology. The second is work done on gender norms, emerging historically from feminist scholars working to counter gender inequality. As these two streams of work intersect, conceptual clarity is needed to understand differences and similarities between these two traditions. Increased clarity will improve efforts to address harmful norms and practices. In this article, we review similarities and differences between social and gender norms, reviewing the history of the concepts and identifying key tension points of contrast. We identified six areas of comparison that might be helpful for practitioners working for the promotion of global health as they make sense of social and gender norms. We then offer a definition of gender norms for practitioners and researchers working at the intersection between these two theories. Our definition draws from the two different streams of thought of how norms influence people's actions, acknowledging the double nature of gender norms: beliefs nested in people's minds and embedded in institutions that profoundly affect health‐related behaviours and shape differential access to health services.

The gender pay gap literature supplies mechanisms but does not attend to organizational variation; the gender and science literature provides insights on the role of masculinist culture in disciplines but misses pay gap mechanisms. A data set of federal workers allows comparison of men and women in the same jobs and workplaces. Agencies associated with traditionally masculine (engineering, physical sciences) and gender-neutral (biological, interdisciplinary sciences) fields differ. Pay-gap mechanisms vary: human capital differences explain a larger share in gender-neutral agencies, while at male-typed agencies men are frequently paid more than women within the same job. Although beyond the federal workers’ standardized pay scale, some interdisciplinary agencies more often pay men off grade, leading to higher earnings for men. Our theory of organizational variation helps explain local agency variation and how pay practices matter in specific organizational contexts.

Results: None of our decompositions or projections reveal increased gender earnings differentials over the sample period. If anything, the unexplained differentials modestly decline.

The aim of this study is to disentangle the role of income and family type in educational inequalities in mortality in Sweden during 1990–2009, focusing on gender differences. Methods: Data on individuals born in Sweden between the ages of 30 and 74 years were collected from total population registries, covering a total of 529,275 deaths and 729 million person-months. Temporary life expectancies (age 30–74 years) by education were calculated using life tables, and rate ratios were estimated with Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Results: Temporary life expectancy improved among all groups except low educated women. Relative educational inequalities in mortality (RRs) increased from 1.79 to 1.98 among men and from 1.78 to 2.10 among women. Variation in family type explained some of the inequalities among men, but not among women, and did not contribute to the trend. Variation in income explained a larger part of the educational inequalities among men compared to women and also explained the increase in educational inequalities in mortality among men and women. Conclusions: Increasing educational inequalities in mortality in Sweden may be attributed to the increase in income inequalities in mortality.

"Healthcare discrimination, anticipated HIV stigma, and income as predictors of HIV testing among a community sample of YBMSM","D'Anna, Laura Hoyt; Chang, Kyle","Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are at particular risk for HIV, and knowing one’s HIV status is key to preventing new HIV infections. Data were derived from a community-based study involving 250 YBMSM to examine the relationships between race-based discrimination experienced in healthcare settings, anticipated HIV stigma, household income and lifetime HIV testing. Lifetime HIV testing was regressed on racial discrimination in healthcare settings, anticipated HIV stigma, and income, and a significant 3-way interaction was found. To help interpret the 3-way interaction, lifetime HIV testing was regressed on racial discrimination in healthcare settings and anticipated HIV stigma in two separate models; with low-income and higher-income YBMSM. Anticipated HIV stigma was found to predict HIV testing among low-income YBMSM. A significant interaction was detected such that low-income YBMSM with low levels of anticipated HIV stigma were more likely to get tested for HIV regardless of experiences with healthcare discrimination, while low-income YBMSM who reported greater anticipated HIV stigma and more experiences of healthcare discrimination were less likely to get tested for HIV.

Heterogeneity in the US gender wage gap,"Bach, Philipp; Chernozhukov, Victor; Spindler, Martin","As a measure of gender inequality, the gender wage gap has come to play an important role both in academic research and the public debate. In 2016, the majority of full-time employed women in the United States earned significantly less than comparable men. The extent to which women were affected by gender inequality in earnings, however, depended greatly on socio-economic characteristics, such as marital status or educational attainment. In this paper, we analyse data from the 2016 American Community Survey using a high-dimensional wage regression and applying double lasso to quantify heterogeneity in the gender wage gap. We find that the wage gap varied substantially across women and that the magnitude of the gap varied primarily by marital status, having children at home, race, occupation, industry, and educational attainment.

Hidden talents: Poly (I:C)‐induced maternal immune activation improves mouse visual discrimination performance and reversal learning in a sex‐dependent manner,"Zhao, Xin; Tran, Hieu; DeRosa, Holly; Roderick, Ryland C.; Kentner, Amanda C.","While there is a strong focus on the negative consequences of maternal immune activation (MIA) on developing brains, very little attention is directed towards potential advantages of early life challenges. In this study, we utilized a polyinosine‐polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) MIA model to test visual pairwise discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (RL) in mice using touchscreen technology. Significant sex differences emerged in that MIA reduced the latency for males to make a correct choice in the PD task while females reached criterion sooner, made fewer errors, and utilized fewer correction trials in RL compared to saline controls. These surprising improvements were accompanied by the sex‐specific upregulation of several genes critical to cognitive functioning, indicative of compensatory plasticity in response to MIA. In contrast, when exposed to a 'two‐hit' stress model (MIA + loss of the social component of environmental enrichment [EE]), mice did not display anhedonia but required an increased number of PD and RL correction trials. These animals also had significant reductions of CamK2a mRNA in the prefrontal cortex. Appropriate functioning of synaptic plasticity, via mediators such as this protein kinase and others, are critical for behavioral flexibility. Although EE has been implicated in, delaying the appearance of symptoms associated with certain brain disorders, these findings are in line with evidence that it also makes individuals more vulnerable to its loss. Overall, with the right 'dose', early life stress exposure can confer at least some functional advantages, which are lost when the number or magnitude of these exposures become too great.

Income inequality not gender inequality positively covaries with female sexualization on social media,"Blake, Khandis R.; Bastian, Brock; Denson, Thomas F.; Grosjean, Pauline; Brooks, Robert C.","Publicly displayed, sexualized depictions of women have proliferated, enabled by new communication technologies, including the internet and mobile devices. These depictions are often claimed to be outcomes of a culture of gender inequality and female oppression, but, paradoxically, recent rises in sexualization are most notable in societies that have made strong progress toward gender parity. Few empirical tests of the relation between gender inequality and sexualization exist, and there are even fewer tests of alternative hypotheses. We examined aggregate patterns in 68,562 sexualized self-portrait photographs ('sexy selfies') shared publicly on Twitter and Instagram and their association with city-, county-, and cross-national indicators of gender inequality. We then investigated the association between sexy-selfie prevalence and income inequality, positing that sexualization—a marker of high female competition—is greater in environments in which incomes are unequal and people are preoccupied with relative social standing. Among 5,567 US cities and 1,622 US counties, areas with relatively more sexy selfies were more economically unequal but not more gender oppressive. A complementary pattern emerged cross-nationally (113 nations): Income inequality positively covaried with sexy-selfie prevalence, particularly within more developed nations. To externally validate our findings, we investigated and confirmed that economically unequal (but not gender-oppressive) areas in the United States also had greater aggregate sales in goods and services related to female physical appearance enhancement (beauty salons and women’s clothing).

V.; Van Dyck, D.","Background: Physical inactivity is a global pandemic associated with a high burden of disease and premature mortality. There is also a trend in growing economic inequalities which impacts population health. There is no global analysis of the relationship between income inequality and population levels of physical inactivity. Methods: Two thousand sixteen World Health Organisation’s country level data about compliance with the 2010 global physical activity guidelines were analysed against country level income interquantile ratio data obtained from the World Bank, OECD and World Income Inequality Database. The analysis was stratified by country income (Low, Middle and High) according to the World Bank classification and gender. Multiple regression was used to quantify the association between physical activity and income inequality. Models were adjusted for GDP and percentage of GDP spent on health care for each country and out of pocket health care spent. Results: Significantly higher levels of inactivity and a wider gap between the percentage of women and men meeting global physical activity guidelines were found in countries with higher income inequality in high and middle income countries irrespective of a country wealth and spend on health care. For example, in higher income countries, for each point increase in the interquantile ratio data, levels of inactivity in women were 3.73% (CI 0.89 6.57) higher, levels of inactivity in men were 2.04% (CI 0.08 4.15) higher and the gap in inactivity levels between women and men was 1.50% larger (CI 0.16 2.83). Similar relationships were found in middle income countries with lower effect sizes. These relationships were, however, not demonstrated in the low-income countries.

Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate differences in the use of ICT between racial and ethnic groups as well as by English language proficiency. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 246 women who were aged 18 years or older and pregnant or within 1 year of delivery. They were recruited from 4 hospital-based outpatient clinics and completed a self-administered survey. We used multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and ICT (mobile phone/short message service [SMS] text message, Internet, and social network) usage by race/ethnicity and perceived English language proficiency after adjusting for age, income, marital status, and insurance status. Results: In all, 28% (69/246) of participants were Latina, 40% (98/246) were African American, 23% (56/246) were white, and 9% (23/246) from other racial/ethnic groups. Of the Latinas, 84% (58/69) reported limited English language proficiency and 59% (41/69) were uninsured. More than 90% of all participants reported mobile phone use, but more than 25% (65/246) had changed phone numbers 2 or more times in the past year. Compared to white women, African American women were less likely to SMS text message (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.63) and Latinas were less likely to use the Internet to find others with similar concerns (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.73). Women with limited English language proficiency were less likely to use the Internet overall (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.99) or use email (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.63) compared to women with adequate English language proficiency. Conclusions: Mobile phones are widely available for the delivery of health interventions to low-income, racially diverse pregnant and postpartum women, but disparities in Internet use and SMS text messaging exist. Interventions or programs requiring Web-based apps may have lower uptake unless alternatives are available, such as those adapted for limited English proficiency populations.

Inpatient diagnoses of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in the United States: Demographic and socioeconomic disparities,"Ghaffari-Rafi, Arash; Mehdizadeh, Rana; Ghaffari-Rafi, Shadeh; Leon-Rojas, Jose","Introduction: Epidemiology provides an avenue for identifying disease pathogenesis, hence determining national incidence, along with socioeconomic and demographic variables involved in iNPH, can provide direction in elucidating the etiology and addressing healthcare inequalities. Methods: To investigate incidence (per 100,000) of iNPH diagnoses applied to the inpatient population, with respect to sex, age, income, residence, and race/ethnicity, we queried the largest American administrative dataset (2008–2016), the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), which surveys 20% of United States (US) discharges. Results: Annual national inpatient incidence (with 25th and 75th quartiles) for iNPH diagnoses was 2.86 (2.72, 2.93). Males had an inpatient incidence of 3.27 (3.11, 3.39), higher (p = 0.008) than female at 2.45 (2.41, 2.47). Amongst age groups inpatient incidence varied (p = 0.000004) and was largest amongst the 85+ group at 18.81 (16.40, 19.95). Individuals with middle/high income had an inpatient incidence of 2.96 (2.77, 3.06), higher (p = 0.008) than the 2.37 (2.24, 2.53) of low-income patients. Depending on whether patients lived in urban, suburban, or rural communities, inpatient incidence diverged (p = 0.01) as follows, respectively: 2.65; 2.66; 3.036. Amongst race/ethnicity (p = 0.000003), inpatient incidence for Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans were as follows, respectively: 3.88 (3.69, 3.93), 1.065 (1.015, 1.14); 0.82 (0.76, 0.85); 0.43 (0.33, 0.52); 0.027 (0.026, 0.12). Conclusion: In the US, inpatient incidence for iNPH diagnoses exhibited disparities between socioeconomic and demographic strata, emphasizing a healthcare inequality. Disproportionately, diagnoses were applied most to patients who were White, male, 65 and older, middle/high income, and living in rural communities.

Interactive apps prevent gender discrepancies in early‐grade mathematics in a low‐income country in sub‐Sahara Africa,"Pitchford, Nicola J.; Chigeda, Antonie; Hubber, Paula J.","Globally, gender differences are reported in the early acquisition of reading and mathematics as girls tend to outperform boys in reading, whereas boys tend to outperform girls in mathematics. This can have long‐term impact resulting in an under‐representation of girls in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subjects. Recent research suggests that sociocultural factors account for differences across genders in the acquisition of these foundational skills. In this study, we investigated whether a new technology‐based intervention, that included activities accessible to both boys and girls, can reduce gender differences from emerging during the early primary school years. The novel instructional method used in this study employed apps developed by onebillion© delivered individually through touch‐screen tablets. Over a series of experiments conducted in Malawi, a low‐income country in sub‐Sahara Africa, we found that when children were exposed to standard pedagogical practice typical gender differences emerged over the first grade (Experiment 1). In contrast, boys and girls learnt equally well with the new interactive apps designed to support the learning of mathematics (Experiment 2) and reading (Experiment 3). When implemented at the start of primary education, before significant gender discrepancies become established, this novel technology‐based intervention can prevent significant gender effects for mathematics. These results demonstrate that different instructional practices influence the emergence of gender disparities in early mathematics. Digital interventions can mitigate gender differences in countries where standard pedagogical instruction typically hinders girls from acquiring early mathematical skills at the same rate as boys.

Interoception and gender: What aspects should we pay attention to?,"Grabauskaitė, Aida; Baranauskas, Mindaugas; Griškova-Bulanova, Inga","Interoception is involved in both somatic and mental disorders with different prevalence between genders; however, gender differences are often neglected. To examine the potential gender differences in interoceptive awareness, we recruited 376 healthy subjects (51% males, aged 17–30 years), to fill in the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). Of that sample, in a subgroup of 40 subjects (50% males), interoceptive accuracy was assessed by heartbeat counting task (HCT). The results on interroceptive awareness suggest that females tendto notice bodily sensations more often, better understand relations between bodily sensations and emotional states, worry or experience more emotional distress with sensations of pain or discomfort and see body as less safe. The results of interoceptive accuracy further suggest that females are less efficient in consciously detecting heartbeats. Therefore, gender should be considered when interoceptive evaluation is performed in disorders associated to bodily sensations and to the emotional/mood states.

Intersectional invisibility experiences of low-income African-American women in healthcare encounters,"Okoro, O. N.; Hillman, L. A.; Cernasev, A.","Background: The disparities that Black/African-American women experience in health care are persistent and staggering. Findings from health outcomes research continue to demonstrate poorer outcomes for African-American women compared to women of other race/ethnicity in several conditions. These racial/ethnic and gender health disparities observed are complex, heavily nuanced and multi-factorial. To understand these, there is a need to apply an ‘intersectionality’ lens. Intersectionality refers to the experience of persons with multiple intersecting statuses. The objective of this exploratory study was to gain insight into the healthcare experiences of low-income African-American women. Methods: In-depth one-on-one interviews were conducted with 22 women and 2 focus group discussions with community leaders and advocates. Investigators conducted a thematic analysis of the transcripts. Results: The thematic analysis revealed four major themes, which tell the story of the intersectional invisibility experienced by low-income AA women in the healthcare system. These included (1) the perception of ‘not feeling heard’; (2) patient as ‘expert of her own body’; (3) disregard of patient preferences; and (4) the need for self-advocacy. Conclusions: Black/African-American women, and particularly those with socioeconomic disadvantage, experience intersectional invisibility resulting from provider implicit bias, stereotypical assumptions, and systemic structures that enable discriminatory practices in healthcare delivery. Healthcare provider education that more explicitly addresses these biases and stereotypes should be complemented with system-level interventions that aim to dismantle the structural racism inherent in healthcare policies and practices.

Is anemia in low income pregnant women related to their infants’ having anemia? A cohort study of pregnant women-infant pairs in the United States,"Leslie, Mayri Sagady; Park, Jeongyoung; Briggs, Linda A.; El-Banna, Majeda M.; Greene, Jessica","Objective: Given evidence that anemia in the first year of life is associated with long-term cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits, reducing infant anemia is important. The primary objective of this research is to examine whether anemia in low income pregnant women in the United States is associated with anemia in the women’s infants. Methods: This cohort study linked Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data on pregnant women with incomes below 185% of the federal poverty level from 2010 and 2011 with data on 6–11 month olds from 2011, resulting in a sample of 21,246 uniquely matched mother-infant pairs. We examined bivariate and multivariate relationship between anemia severity in pregnant women and in their infants. Results: Seventeen percent of women had anemia (13.1% mild and 3.9% moderate to severe) and 20.1% infants had anemia (16.4% mild and 3.7% moderate to severe). For both women and infants, blacks had substantially higher anemia rates than whites. In bivariate analysis and multivariate analyses maternal anemia showed a dose–response relationship to infant anemia. In predicted probabilities from the multivariate models, 27.2% of infants born to pregnant women with moderate to severe anemia had anemia, compared to 23.3% for infants whose mothers had mild anemia, and 18.3% for infants whose mothers did not have anemia. Conclusion: This study provides strong evidence of a relationship between maternal and infant anemia in the United States among people with low incomes.

However, sextortion remains an under-researched field in many countries, especially in the non-Western world. Informed by feminist theories, this study analysed the causes and consequences of sextortion in Rwanda. A mixed-methods design was applied with qualitative data being collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with 150 respondents. Data analysis was inspired by a qualitative approach of thematic analysis. Emergent themes from the interviews were identified and coded using NVivo software, while SPSS software was useful to generate descriptive statistics in order to characterise the data set based on its properties. Key findings include the dearth of reporting cases of sextortion and its laws; persistence of patriarchal system; gender income inequality and an increase in the unemployment rate as the main causes of sextortion. The decline of victims’ economic status; psychological and health problems; an increase of gender inequality and domestic violence; a decrease of productivity and credibility; and deterioration of various human rights were among the main consequences of this phenomenon. These findings bear significant practical implications including the fact that sextortion may undermine efforts to end gender inequality.

Life-course income trajectories of men and women in Norway: Implications for self-rated health in later life,"Veenstra, Marijke; Aartsen, Marja","Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in health are well-established, but studies addressing lagged effects of income or of fluctuations in income over the life course are relatively rare. The current study aims to (i) identify and describe life-course income trajectories for men and women who are currently in later life; and (ii) assess the association of income trajectories with self-rated health in older adults. Methods: The study sample consisted of 1625 men and 1634 women born between 1937 and 1955 who participated in the third wave of the Norwegian Life course, Ageing and Generation Study. Latent class growth analyses were used to estimate dominant income trajectories from ages 30 through 62 in men and women. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were specified to analyze the association of income trajectories with self-rated health in later life. Results: Four trajectories in women and three trajectories in men were estimated as dominant patterns of income over the life course. Differences in the level of income were considerable at age 30 and accumulated over time. Continued exposure to low income showed statistically significant higher odds for poor self-rated health in older men and women. This association remained significant after taking differences in educational attainment, working life, family formation and accumulated wealth into account. Conclusion: The findings suggested remarkable rigidity in income groups that had formed by age 30. A significant share of men and women remain mired in relatively low-income status across the life course with negative implications for health in later life.

Lifetime discrimination in low to middle income mothers and cellular aging: A prospective analysis,"Carroll, Judith E.; Price, Jonah Eliezer; Brown, Joni; Bamishigbin, Olajide; Shalowitz, Madeleine U.; Ramey, Sharon; Schetter, Christine Dunkel","Background: Experiences of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and other characteristics are associated with adverse health outcomes, including elevated rates of morbidity in later life and earlier mortality. Acceleration of biological aging is a plausible pathway linking discrimination to disease risk. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship of self-reported lifetime and everyday discrimination to women's telomere length several years after birth of a child in a longitudinal cohort study. Methods: The Community Child Health Network (CCHN) conducted a community-based participatory research project focused on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in maternal and child health. Data for the current substudy are from a longitudinal cohort study in 3 of the 5 project sites. This multi-site community-based longitudinal study was conducted in Lake County, IL north of Chicago, Washington, D.C., and rural North Carolina. Participants were low to middle-income mothers (N = 103) with a primary identity of Hispanic/Latina, Black, or non-Hispanic White who rated their experience of everyday and lifetime discrimination during an at-home interview one-month postpartum. Buccal samples were collected to assay buccal cell telomere length several years later when a consecutive child was 3–5 years of age. Telomere length derived from buccal cells was used as a biomarker indicating cellular aging and a risk factor for age-related disease. Results: Mothers (18–39 years old) who reported higher lifetime discrimination had shorter telomere length an average of 5.6 years later (B = −0.22 [SE = 0.04], p < 0.001). Mother's reports of everyday discrimination were not significantly related to telomere length (0.01[0.01], p = 0.15). Conclusions: These findings suggest that lifetime exposure to discrimination, but not necessarily current reports of everyday discrimination, may increase biological aging as indicated by shorter buccal cell telomere length, providing evidence of a plausible route through which discrimination contributes to increased risk for earlier onset aging and age-related disease in women.

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are also associated with ASD. We examined the joint associations of maternal metabolic conditions and BCAAs on the risk of child ASD and whether the associations differed by child’s sex. We analyzed 789 mother–infant pairs, a subset of the Boston Birth Cohort, from a predominantly urban, low-income, minority population. Maternal plasma BCAAs were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry in samples collected 24–72 hr postpartum. A composite BCAA score was created using factor analysis, and prepregnancy obesity and diabetes (ob/DM) were combined into one variable. Logistic regression was used to explore the role of BCAAs as mediators or cofactors with ob/DM and child’s sex on ASD risk. BCAA-ob/DM and BCAA-sex interactions were also examined. Maternal BCAAs alone were not associated with ASD and did not mediate the path between ob/DM and ASD. In the presence of maternal ob/DM, BCAA score was significantly associated with ASD (adjusted OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.18, 4.60). Interactions were present for valine with ob/DM and for valine and isoleucine with male sex on ASD risk. The odds ratio (OR) for risk of ASD was the greatest with all three risk factors combined—male sex, above median BCAA score, and ob/DM (OR 10.79, 95% CI 4.40, 26.42).

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 1465 schoolchildren in grades 3 and 6. Mental health was measured by the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self Report (Total problems and 14 specific problem areas). Potential socio-demographic determinants were sex, parental education and occupation, family structure, and immigrant status. Results: Mental problems were present in 14% of the sixth graders and in 7% of the third graders. In grade 3, the mean total problem score was lower in girls than in boys, but the prevalence of problems at a subclinical/clinical level did not differ by sex. Furthermore, in nine to 13 of the 14 specific problem areas, problems were equally distributed by sex, parental education, parental occupation, immigrant status, and family structure. In grade 6, both the total mean score and the overall odds of subclinical/clinical problems were similar in girls and boys. Likewise, in all the specific problem areas, problems were evenly distributed by parental education and occupation, and only independently associated with immigrant status and family structure in one problem area. In five specific problem areas, boys had higher odds of problems than girls. Conclusions: This study shows that also in a relatively wealthy and equal country such as Sweden, mental problems are a significant child public health issue.

At study entry, the mean age of women was 49·8 years (SD 9·7) compared with 50·8 years (9·8) in men. As of data cutoff (Sept 13, 2021), 4280 major cardiovascular disease events had occurred in women (age-standardised incidence rate of 5·0 events [95% CI 4·9–5·2] per 1000 person-years) and 4911 in men (8·2 [8·0–8·4] per 1000 person-years). Compared with men, women presented with a more favourable cardiovascular risk profile, especially at younger ages. The HRs for metabolic risk factors were similar in women and men, except for non-HDL cholesterol, for which high non-HDL cholesterol was associated with an HR for major cardiovascular disease of 1·11 (95% CI 1·01–1·21) in women and 1·28 (1·19–1·39) in men, with a consistent pattern for higher risk among men than among women with other lipid markers. Symptoms of depression had a HR of 1·09 (0·98–1·21) in women and 1·42 (1·25–1·60) in men. By contrast, consumption of a diet with a PURE score of 4 or lower (score ranges from 0 to 8), was more strongly associated with major cardiovascular disease in women (1·17 [1·08–1·26]) than in men (1·07 [0·99–1·15]). The total PAFs associated with behavioural and psychosocial risk factors were greater in men (15·7%) than in women (8·4%) predominantly due to the larger contribution of smoking to PAFs in men (ie, 1·3% [95% CI 0·5–2·1] in women vs 10·7% [8·8–12·6] in men). Interpretation: Lipid markers and depression are more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in men than in women, whereas diet is more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in women than in men. The similar associations of other risk factors with cardiovascular disease in women and men emphasise the importance of a similar strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in men and women.

"Morbidity and mortality in homeless individuals, prisoners, sex workers, and individuals with substance use disorders in high-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Aldridge, Robert W.; Story, Alistair; Hwang, Stephen W.; Nordentoft, Merete; Luchenski, Serena A.; Hartwell, Greg; Tweed, Emily J.; Lewer, Dan; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Hayward, Andrew C.","Background: Inclusion health focuses on people in extremely poor health due to poverty, marginalisation, and multimorbidity. We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates). Summary estimates were calculated using a random effects model. Findings: Our search identified 7946 articles, of which 337 studies were included for analysis. All-cause standardised mortality ratios were significantly increased in 91 (99%) of 92 extracted datapoints and were 11·86 (95% CI 10·42–13·30; I² = 94·1%) in female individuals and 7·88 (7·03–8·74; I² = 99·1%) in men. Summary SMR estimates for the International Classification of Diseases disease categories with two or more included datapoints were highest for deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, in both men (7·89; 95% CI 6·40–9·37; I² = 98·1%) and women (18·72; 13·73–23·71; I² = 91·5%). Disease prevalence was consistently raised across the following categories: infections (eg, highest reported was 90% for hepatitis C, 67 [65%] of 103 individuals for hepatitis B, and 133 [51%] of 263 individuals for latent tuberculosis infection), mental health (eg, highest reported was 9 [4%] of 227 individuals for schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (eg, highest reported was 32 [13%] of 247 individuals for coronary heart disease), and respiratory conditions (eg, highest reported was 9 [26%] of 35 individuals for asthma). Interpretation: Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

Design: Feasibility study; Setting: Washington Heights, New York, USA is a low socioeconomic status area. Subjects: Mothers aged 18 and above with children under 12 years of age and living in Washington Heights were recruited. Intervention: FT4W, a community-based intervention delivered through a neighbourhood-based app, offering weekly dance and yoga classes, food pantry visits and group playdates. Childcare professionals cared for participants' children during wellness activities. Measures: A bespoke before and after survey was designed and tested for its ability to collect relevant data to assess the impact of FT4W. Outcomes included recruitment rates, participation, attrition, acceptability, and success of the community champion. Analysis: Comparisons of proportions and means. Results: Twenty-one mothers participated in the study of which 90% attended ≥ 1 FT4W activity; 65% ≥ 2; 52% ≥ 3. The survey was completed by a 100% of participants indicating it was easy to understand and not too burdensome. All measures detected change in constructs from baseline to follow-up. Availability of childcare was the most commonly (66%) reported reason participants were able to engage in the offered wellness activities. Conclusion: Conducting a larger-scale trial to assess the impact of FT4W is feasible considering 4 major lessons. (1) Recruitment, retention, and acceptability rates were high; however, moms need additional support to increase participation in wellness activities and improve tech literacy. (2) Research measures were sensitive enough to detect change, but the timing of assessments needs to be considered. (3) Participants greatly valued access to professional childcare.

Navigating social and institutional obstacles: Low-income women seeking abortion,"Ostrach, Bayla; Cheyney, Melissa","Nearly half of all women in the United States will have at least one abortion during their lifetime, and many will encounter economic, logistical, and/or social obstacles while attempting to undergo the procedure. The purpose of this project was to examine the abortion-seeking experiences of a volunteer sample of Oregon women, to identify key barriers and the strategies women employed to overcome them. Using a mixed-methods approach combining survey and interview data with participant observation, we found that low-income women experienced structural and economic barriers to abortion even though abortion is covered by the state Medicaid program in Oregon. Social support helped women overcome obstacles, and a lack of support was itself experienced as an obstacle. Women of lower socioeconomic status also encountered more barriers and had a more difficult time overcoming them. Our findings indicate the need for improved advocacy to reduce structural delay, and to improve access to social support and other resources needed for timely abortion care.

Nursing pay by gender distribution in the UK—Does the Glass Escalator still exist?,"Punshon, Geoffrey; Maclaine, Katrina; Trevatt, Paul; Radford, Mark; Shanley, Oliver; Leary, Alison","Aims and objectives/background: Nursing is a predominantly female profession. This is reflected in the demographic of nursing around the world. Some authors have noted that despite being a gendered profession men are still advantaged in terms of pay and opportunity. The aim of this study was to examine if the so called glass escalator in which men are advantaged in female professionals still exists. Design and method: Descriptive statistics of the routinely collected national workforce datasets from across the UK central repositories and mining of a bespoke data set that has been curated which focuses on the activity of specialist advanced practice clinical nurses. Results: Even in a gendered occupation such as nursing the advantage of men in terms of pay is apparent with men being over-represented at senior Bands compared to their overall proportion in the UK nursing population. From the bespoke dataset there also seem to be an advantage in term of faster attainment of higher grades from the point of registration. Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice: Reward and remuneration are essential to the workforce. This work reveals a gender differential towards men in higher paid nursing work. The drivers for this are complex and further work is required to determine the factors associated with career progression with men in nursing, and the rate limiting factors with the female workforce.

Using a qualitative descriptive design with focus‐group discussions, we conducted a study in three middle schools set in low‐ to middle‐income neighborhoods in urban and rural areas of Karachi, Pakistan. We engaged 86 youth (50% girls; aged 10–15 years) that were purposefully selected from grade six (31.4%), seven (44.2%) and eight (24.4%) classrooms, balancing gender and locality. In each focus group, we asked participants to describe their after school activity routine on a typical weekday afternoon until bedtime. Digital recordings of discussions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. Based on sixteen focus groups with five to six participants in each group, we identified eight distinct categories: religious activities, schoolwork, screentime, helping adult family members, family time, outdoor play, indoor leisure activities, and hanging out with friends. We found that structured activities (e.g., religious activities and schoolwork supervised by an adult) were reported more frequently than unstructured activities (e.g., outdoor play and family time). Participation in activities varied by gender and location (i.e., urban vs. rural), highlighting disparities associated with the sociocultural context that marginalized youth face. Our findings provide a glimpse into the everyday lives of Pakistani youth outside of school. Additionally, they elucidate how economic resources, sociocultural norms regarding gender, and community safety shape youth's time use and socialization patterns. Findings from this study can inform the development of OST activities and initiatives aimed at promoting the positive development of Pakistani youth.

We examined perceived financial barriers to, and the perceived cost burden of, cervical cancer screening. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 702 low-income, uninsured or publicly insured women ages 25–64 years in North Carolina, U.S., who were not up to date on cervical cancer screening according to national guidelines. Participants were asked about perceived financial barriers to screening and how much they perceived screening would cost. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the sociodemographic predictors of perceived financial barriers. Results: Seventy-two percent of participants perceived financial barriers to screening. Screening appointment costs (71%) and follow-up/future treatment costs (44%) were most commonly reported, followed by lost pay due to time missed from work (6%) and transportation costs (5%). In multivariable analysis, being uninsured (vs. publicly insured), younger (25–34 vs. 50–64 years), White (vs. Black), and not reporting income data were associated with perceiving screening costs and future treatment costs as barriers to screening. Participants reported wide-ranging estimates of the perceived out-of-pocket cost of screening ($0–$1300), with a median expected cost of $245. Conclusions: The majority of our sample of low-income women perceived substantial financial barriers to screening, particularly related to screening appointment costs and potential follow-up/future treatment costs.

Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of detailed survey and medical chart data from an intervention to improve timely postpartum visits among Medicaid-insured, high-risk women in NYC from 2015 to 2016. Among 380 women who completed surveys at baseline (bedside postpartum) and 3 weeks after delivery, we examined the incidence of having an ED visit or readmission within 3 weeks postpartum. We used logistic regression to examine unadjusted and adjusted associations between patient demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics and the odds of postpartum hospital use. Results: In total, 12.8% (n = 48) of women reported an ED visit or readmission within 3 weeks postpartum. Unadjusted odds of postpartum hospital use were higher among women who self-identified as Black versus Latina, U.S. born versus foreign born, and English versus Spanish speaking. Clinical and psychosocial characteristics associated with increased unadjusted odds of postpartum hospital use included cesarean delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and positive depression or anxiety screen, and we found preliminary evidence of decreased hospital use among women breastfeeding at three weeks postpartum. The odds of seeking postpartum hospital care remained roughly 2.5 times higher among women with hypertension or depression/anxiety in adjusted analyses. Conclusions: We identified characteristics associated with ED visits and hospital readmissions among a high-risk subset of postpartum women in NYC.

These include a wide power difference between health provider and patient, and a different perception of risk through externalization of responsibility of risk management within a religious context as well as a context shaped by authority. Also, therapeutic misconception was observed. The combination of these factors ensued women to rely on the opinion of the medical professional, rather than being guided by their own motivation to participation. Although being a (pregnant) woman per se should not render the label of being vulnerable, this study shows there are factors that influence the decision process of pregnant woman towards trial participation in a LMIC context that can result in vulnerability. The identification of context‐specific factors that can create vulnerability facilitates adaptation of the design and conduct of research in a culturally competent manner.

Prevalence of food addiction among low-income reproductive-aged women,"Berenson, Abbey B.; Laz, Tabassum H.; Pohlmeier, Ali M.; Rahman, Mahbubur; Cunningham, Kathryn A.","Background: Hyperpalatable foods (i.e., high in salt, sugar, or fat) have been shown to have addictive properties that may contribute to overeating. Prior studies conducted on food addiction behaviors are mostly based on white and middle-aged women. Data are not available, however, on reproductive-aged women from other races/ethnicities or low-income women. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of food addiction among multiethnic women of low socioeconomic status. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health behaviors, including food addiction according to the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) between July 2010 and February 2011 among 18- to 40-year-old low-income women attending reproductive-health clinics (N = 1,067). Results: Overall, 2.8% of women surveyed met the diagnosis of food addiction. The prevalence of food addiction did not differ by age group, race/ethnicity, education, income, or body mass index categories, tobacco and alcohol use, or physical activity. However, it did differ by level of depression (p < 0.01). The YFAS symptom count score significantly differed by race/ethnicity (p < 0.01) with black women having higher scores than Hispanic women. Racial differences were also observed among some of the YFAS symptoms. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated a low prevalence of food addiction among low-income, reproductive-aged women. Racial differences were observed in the YFAS symptom count score, but not in the overall prevalence of food addition. Additionally, women with food addiction had higher levels of depression than women without food addiction.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional quantitative survey of 5th and 6th year medical students in four public medical schools in Ghana. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 20. Results: Responses were obtained from 545 medical students (response rate of 52%). Significantly, more male medical students expressed that stigma is an important consideration for them to choose or not to choose a career in psychiatry compared to their female counterparts (42.7% v. 29.7%, respectively). Over two-thirds of the medical students perceived that psychiatrists were at risk of being attacked by their patients, with just a little over a third expressing that risk was an important consideration for them to choose a career in psychiatry. There were no gender differences regarding perceptions about risk. Around 3 to 4 out of 10 medical students will consider careers in psychiatry if offered various incentives with no gender differences in responses provided. Conclusion: Our study presents important and novel findings in the Ghanaian context, which can assist health policy planners and medical training institutions in Ghana to formulate policies and programs that will increase the number of psychiatry residents and thereby increase the psychiatrist-to-patient ratio in Ghana.

"Pubertal timing, neighborhood income, and mental health in boys and girls: Findings from the adolescent brain cognitive development study","Niu, Li; Sheffield, Perry; Li, Yan","Early pubertal timing is associated with youth mental health problems, with association amplified or mitigated by characteristics of the residential neighborhood. Yet, limited research simultaneously examines the roles of neighborhood context and biological sex in this association. This study fills this research gap by examining sex-specific associations between pubertal timing and neighborhood income with youth mental health problems (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) in a longitudinal cohort of early adolescents in the United States (US). Participants were 9201 youth aged 9 or 10 years from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Pubertal timing was the average of parent- and youth-reported pubertal status standardized within sex and age. Outcome variables were youths’ internalizing and externalizing symptoms assessed at 1-year follow-up via parent survey. We evaluated interaction effects between pubertal timing and neighborhood income in a series of sex-stratified linear mixed effect models, adjusted for family and personal sociodemographic characteristics. In girls, earlier pubertal timing was associated with more internalizing (β = 0.06, p < 0.001) and externalizing problems (β = 0.07, p < 0.001) at 1-year follow-up, not moderated by neighborhood income. In boys, earlier pubertal timing was associated with more externalizing problems among youth living in high-income neighborhoods, but not among those in low-income neighborhoods (interaction-p = 0.006). Results suggest that pubertal timing may affect youth mental health differentially in boys and girls, depending on the neighborhood contexts. These findings highlight the importance of both biological and social forces in shaping adolescent mental health and, thus, have public health and clinical implications for health promotion.

"Racial, ethnic, and gender differences in the association between higher state minimum wages and health and mental well-being in US adults with low educational attainment","Buszkiewicz, James H.; Hajat, Anjum; Hill, Heather D.; Otten, Jennifer J.; Drewnowski, Adam","Background: To date, research evaluating the association between minimum wage and health has been heterogenous and varies based on the specific subpopulation or health outcomes under evaluation while associations across racial, ethnic, and gender identities have been understudied. Methods: A triple difference-in-differences strategy using modified Poisson regression was used to evaluate the associations between minimum wage and obesity, hypertension, fair or poor general health, and moderate psychological distress in 25–64-year-old adults with a high school education/GED or less. Data from the 1999–2017 Panel Study of Income Dynamics was linked to state policies and characteristics to estimate the risk ratio (RR) associated with a $1 increase in current and 2-year lagged state minimum wages overall and by race, ethnicity, and gender (non-Hispanic or non-Latino (NH) White men, NH White women, Black, indigenous, or people of color (BIPOC) men, and BIPOC women) adjusting for individual and state-level confounding. Results: No associations between minimum wage and health were observed overall. Among NH White men 2-year lagged minimum wage was associated with reduced risk of obesity (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.67, 0.99). Among NH White women, current minimum wage was associated lower risk of moderate psychological distress (RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54, 1.00) while 2-year lagged minimum wage was associated with higher obesity risk (RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.64) and lower risk of moderate psychological distress (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56, 1.00). Among BIPOC women, current minimum wage was associated with higher risk of fair or poor health (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.40). No associations were observed among BIPOC men. Conclusion: While no associations were observed overall, heterogeneous associations between minimum wage, obesity, and psychological distress by racial, ethnic, and gender strata warrant further study and have implications for health equity research.

"Rationalizing pay inequity: Women engineers, pervasive patriarchy and the neoliberal chimera","Davies, Sharyn Graham; McGregor, Judy; Pringle, Judith; Giddings, Lynne","This article argues that neoliberalism with its pervasive patriarchy and co-option of feminism, renders women tacitly complicit in gendered pay inequalities. We show that in New Zealand, one of the world’s most neoliberal nations, women who might precisely be best equipped to argue for equal pay—engineers—do not do so because neoliberalism makes many feel responsible for, and accepting of, their lower salaries. In interviews and focus groups, many women engineers talk of deserving less pay than men because of their ‘choices’, their ‘personality’ and their lack of ‘responsibility’. In a disempowering environment, some women show agency by disavowing gender as a reason for the pay gap. Such narratives of individualized shortcomings reduce hope of collective action that might uncover and dismantle the systemic causes of pay inequity, which are not due to a woman’s choice or personality but rather what we frame as the neoliberal chimera.

Remote working and digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Economic–financial impacts and psychological drivers for employees,"Battisti, Enrico; Alfiero, Simona; Leonidou, Erasmia","Digital and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and, consequently, remote working have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, workers’ economic–financial perception of remote working conditions, such as digital technology and its implementation, has scarcely been researched. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the economic–financial impacts of remote working on labourers. Using a mixed-methods sequential exploratory design, a sample of 976 workers is investigated. This study highlights that the majority of workers experience a negative economic–financial impact due to the additional costs incurred for digital technology and platforms and for utilities as well as the non-payment of overtime and meal vouchers, which are higher than the savings in commuting costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, this research emphasizes that psychological–behavioural variables, specifically job satisfaction and technostress, are essential in the choice to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, our results have important theoretical implications related to the existing literature both on the managerial issues connected to digital transformation, with interdisciplinary elements linked to psychological aspects, and on corporate finance topics associated to the economic–financial impacts of remote working.

Consistent with widely available information, Black, Hispanic, and female professors are underrepresented and White and Asian professors are overrepresented in our data. Disadvantaged minority and female underrepresentation is driven predominantly by underrepresentation in science and math intensive fields. A comparison of senior and junior faculty suggests a trend toward greater diversity, especially in science and math intensive fields, because younger faculty are more diverse. However, Black faculty are an exception. We decompose racial-ethnic and gender wage gaps and show that academic field, experience, and research productivity account for most or all of the gaps. We find no evidence of wage premiums for individuals who improve diversity, although for Black faculty we cannot rule out a modest premium.

The author has written this book with insight, using a large amount of previous empirical research and statistics to justify his message that growing inequality needs to be tackled. The author does not analyze only income inequality but takes a more holistic approach to the topic. The author writes about inequality in terms of gender, ethnicity, and social class. The focus of the book is global and not restricted to developed countries. The author introduces three kinds of inequality and their production mechanisms, gives concrete examples, and offers summarizing tables, making his message easier to understand. The author distinguishes three kinds of inequality: vital, existential, and resource inequality. The author concludes his book writing about the decisive battlefields of future inequality, which according to him are the images and institutions of inequality and the orientation of the middle classes. The book is very good, but there are also some weaknesses. The theoretical part is rather light.

"Self-presentation strategies, fear of success and anticipation of future success among university and high school students","Kosakowska-Berezecka, Natasza; Jurek, Paweł; Besta, Tomasz; Badowska, Sylwia","The backlash avoidance model (BAM) suggests women insufficiently self-promote because they fear backlash for behavior which is incongruent with traditional gender roles. Avoiding self-promoting behavior is also potentially related to associating success with negative consequences. In two studies we tested whether self-promotion and fear of success will be predictors of lower salaries and anticipation of lower chances of success in an exam. In study 1, prior to the exam they were about to take, we asked 234 students about their predictions concerning exam results and their future earnings. They also filled scales measuring their associations with success (fear of success) and tendency for self-promotion. The tested model proved that in comparison to men, women expect lower salaries in the future, anticipate lower test performance and associate success with more negative consequences. Both tendency for self-promotion and fear of success are related to anticipation of success in test performance and expectations concerning future earnings. In study 2 we repeated the procedure on a sample of younger female and male high school pupils (N = 100) to verify whether associating success with negative consequences and differences in self-promotion strategies are observable in a younger demographic. Our results show that girls and boys in high school do not differ with regard to fear of success, self-promotion or agency levels. Girls and boys anticipated to obtain similar results in math exam results, but girls expected to have higher results in language exams. Nevertheless, school pupils also differed regarding their future earnings but only in the short term. Fear of success and agency self-ratings were significant predictors of expectations concerning future earnings, but only among high school boys and with regard to earnings expected just after graduation.

Sex differences in genetic and environmental influences on educational attainment and income,"Ørstavik, Ragnhild E.; Czajkowski, Nikolai; Røysamb, Espen; Knudsen, Gun Peggy; Tambs, Kristian; Reichborn-Kjennerud, Ted","In many Western countries, women now reach educational levels comparable to men, although their income remains considerably lower. For the past decades, it has become increasingly clear that these measures of socio-economic status are influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors. Less is known about the relationship between education and income, and sex differences. The aim of this study was to explore genetic and environmental factors influencing education and income in a large cohort of young Norwegian twins, with special emphasis on gender differences. National register data on educational level and income were obtained for 7,710 twins (aged 29–41 years).

The phenotypic correlation between educational level and income was 0.34 (0.32–0.39) for men and 0.45 (0.43–0.48) for women.

Methods: Parent-reported household chaos and observed child self-regulation were collected at baseline [n = 132; M age 23.0 months (standard deviation 2.8)]. Children's body mass index z-score (BMIz) was measured at 33 months. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess whether child sex moderated the chaos-BMIz association. A three-way interaction between chaos, child sex, and self-regulation was also tested. Results: Child sex moderated the chaos-BMIz association (b = −0.11, p = 0.04) such that chaos was positively associated with BMIz among boys (b = 0.12, p = 0.003), but unrelated in girls (b = 0.01, p = 0.78). A three-way interaction with self-regulation indicated that a positive chaos-BMIz association existed only for boys with average (b = 0.12, p = 0.004) and low (b = 0.22, p < 0.001) self-regulation. Conclusions: Boys with poor self-regulation may be particularly vulnerable to obesogenic effects of chaotic households.

The Dark Triad has also been found to be associated with personal economic status. We investigated whether sex and age differences in the Dark Triad varied across countries of different socioeconomic conditions. We further explored whether the dark traits predicted personal income to different extent across countries. We utilized three samples from the UK, Greece, and China (total N = 5,854), whose socioeconomic status varied from more to less developed according to the Human Development Index. Men scored higher than women on the Dark Triad, with the magnitude of sex differences being largest in the UK, followed by Greece and China. Younger people scored higher than older people on the Dark Triad, with the effect of age varying across countries. Narcissism positively predicted income, with its predictive power being significant in China and Greece but null in the UK. The results are consistent with the view that Dark Triad traits may be adaptive responses to environmental challenges. Specifically, the results suggest that sex differences in the Dark Triad and the relation between narcissism and personal income are responsive to socioeconomic conditions at the country level.

Sex differences in the motivation for viewing sexually arousing images,"Kobayashi, Maiko; Nakamura, Koyo; Watanabe, Katsumi","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 9(1) of Evolutionary Psychological Science (see record [rid]2023-55413-010[/rid]). Incorrect figures and tables were used in the original version of the article. The article has been corrected.] Sexual motivation strongly influences mate choice and dating behavior and can be triggered by merely viewing sexually arousing visual images, such as erotic pictures and movies. Previous studies suggested that men, more than women, tend to search for sexual cues that signal promiscuity in short-term mates. However, it remains to be tested whether sex differences in the motivation to view sexual cues can be observed by using robust and well-controlled behavioral measures. To this end, we employed a pay-per-view key-pressing task. Japanese self-identified heterosexual male and female participants viewed images of men, women, or couples with two levels of sexual arousal (sexual vs. less sexual). Participants could alter the viewing time of a presented image according to their willingness to keep viewing it. Male participants were the most eager to view sexually arousing images of the opposite sex, whereas female participants were more strongly motivated to view less sexual images of couples. Such sex differences may reflect differentiated reproductive strategies between men and women in terms of men’s motivation toward promiscuity and women’s motivation toward long-term relationships.

Sexual differentiation of brain and other tissues: Five questions for the next 50 years,"Arnold, Arthur P.","This paper is part of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of founding of the journal Hormones and Behavior, the official journal of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology. All sex differences in phenotypic development stem from the sexual imbalance in X and Y chromosomes, which are the only known differences in XX and XY zygotes. The sex chromosome genes act within cells to cause differences in phenotypes of XX and XY cells throughout the body. In the gonad, they determine the type of gonad, leading to differences in secretion of testicular vs. ovarian hormones, which cause further sex differences in tissue function. These current ideas of sexual differentiation are briefly contrasted with a hormones-only view of sexual differentiation of the last century. The multiple, independent action of diverse sex-biasing agents means that sex-biased factors can be synergistic, increasing sex differences, or compensatory, making the two sexes more equal. Several animal models have been fruitful in demonstrating sex chromosome effects, and interactions with gonadal hormones. MRI studies of human brains demonstrate variation in brain structure associated with both differences in gonadal hormones, and in the number of X and Y chromosomes. Five unanswered questions are posed as a challenge to future investigators to improve understanding of sexual differentiation throughout the body.

Shaping gender disparity in childcare between dual-earner parents in urban China: An exploratory study of influencing factors,"Zhang, Linxiao","Gender disparity in parenting is prominent in contemporary heterosexual families. However, investigations into multi-dimensional factors shaping the disparity in China are limited, though Chinese care arrangements and practices are increasingly influential worldwide with the process of globalization. Therefore, this research uses multi-source data from the 2012 Chinese General Social Survey and the 2014–2015 China Education Panel Survey for quantitative analysis, to explore what drives urban dual-earner parents to share childcare or not. Specifically, the disparity is captured via both parents' general intentions to share paid job and unpaid care responsibilities, and concrete paternal relative time contributions to different types of child-rearing. Two major conclusions are drawn from descriptive statistics and linear regressions. Firstly, there are gendered differences in factors that shape parenting (in)equality. Secondly, there are both similarities and differences in factors of gender (in)equality among different caregiving activities. The results implicate that future childcare and family policies need to be directed towards both genders in diverse domains and be attentive to both quantitative and qualitative inequality.

Smoking in pregnancy among indigenous women in high-income countries: A narrative review,"Gould, Gillian S.; Patten, Christi; Glover, Marewa; Kira, Anette; Jayasinghe, Harshani","Introduction: Pregnant women in socioeconomically disadvantaged circumstances, such as Indigenous women, have a high prevalence of smoking. Tobacco smoking is the most significant reversible risk factor for the health of Indigenous pregnant women and their babies. Methods: As researchers working in this specialized area, we conducted a narrative review of the literature on smoking among Indigenous pregnant women in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. We summarize prevalence and factors influencing tobacco use, interventions, and evidence gaps for tobacco control and smoking cessation. Recommendations are made for future interventions, policy changes, and much-needed research. Results: Common themes emerging across the four countries reveal opportunities for cross-cultural collaborative studies and trials. These include the social–normative use of tobacco as barriers to quitting in pregnancy and the need for evaluations of interventions at the family and community level. Socioeconomic disparities underscore the importance of enhancing the implementation and reach of strategies to prevent and reduce prenatal tobacco smoking among Indigenous women. Elders and community health care providers as role models for nontobacco use could be explored. Qualitative work is needed to understand the barriers and opportunities, such as cultural strengths supporting quitting tobacco to develop more effective approaches. Conclusions: Although a high-priority group, there remains a dearth of research on Indigenous women’s smoking in pregnancy. Studies have assessed knowledge and attitudes to smoking in pregnancy, and small feasibility studies and a few empirical trials have been conducted. Recommendations for promising culturally appropriate cessation interventions have been made. Larger trials are warranted. Implications: Strategies to support quitting among pregnant Indigenous women need to be multifactorial and take account of the social determinants of smoking including historical antecedents, community norms, cultural strengths, and recognition of individual and community needs. Cross-country research collaborations have the potential to leverage funding, share expertise, and strengthen approaches to tackle an important and poorly attended health disparity that has a profound impact on the entire life course for Indigenous peoples.

Social identity and cycling among women: The case of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa,"Parsha, Avi; Martens, Karel","Through the lens of the Social Identify Theory (Tajfel, 1974), this research aims to understand how social identity affects the perception of cycling as a mode of transport among women from different socio-income backgrounds. Using the case study of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa (Israel), we found that cycling is associated with distinct social categories rather than seen as a 'socially neutral' practice. In particular, we found cycling to be associated with 'being a Tel-Avivian' and with a healthy and active lifestyle. Such distinct identification of cycling is likely to enhance cycling uptake among more privileged groups, who are often able to identify with these social categories. In contrast, it may create a barrier for underprivileged groups, who do not identify with these social categories. In addition, we show how e-bikes—which are not identified with privileged groups—do not provide an identifiable alternative for women from all groups, as it is identified with 'tough' and 'violent' men. Furthermore, we show how cycling, in general, is perceived as 'tough', 'dangerous' and as requiring a 'constant struggle' over space with other road users, and hence fits a typical 'masculine' behavior. Finally, we show how currently cycling is perceived by the underprivileged as a threat to their way of life or even as a symbol of them being pushed out of their neighborhood—a perception that limits cycling uptake among these social groups. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for social identity in cycling research and policymaking, especially in low-cycling contexts.

Social inequalities in fertility in women residing in urban neighbourhoods in Spain: A multilevel approach,"Forcadell-Díez, Lluís; Gotsens, Mercè; Leon-Gomez, Brenda Biaani; Pérez, Gloria","Background: Reproductive health inequalities tend to be more marked in large cities because they include neighbourhoods with unequal social and community networks, resources and opportunities. The aim was to describe social inequalities in fertility patterns among women who gave birth between 2007 and 2016 in the city of Barcelona (Spain) by jointly evaluating the effect of individual and socioeconomic neighbourhood characteristics. Methods: We conducted a multilevel study of women’s individual characteristics (age, educational attainment, and country of origin) and neighbourhood characteristics (disposable household income, percentage of unemployment and percentage of foreigners). Results: Multilevel modelling revealed significant variability in fertility across neighbourhoods after adjustment for individual explanatory variables. The fertility rate (FR) was higher in better educated women (adjusted relative risk: aRR 2.76), those aged 30–39 years (aRR 2.13), and in those born in Spain in relation to their respective reference groups. The FR was lowest in women with upper to post-secondary, non-tertiary education (aRR 0.86) who were born in high income countries (aRR 0.57). Women living in neighbourhoods with a low income (aRR 1.46) and with a higher unemployment (aRR 1.33) were more likely to have children. In contrast, women living in neighbourhoods with a lower percentage of foreigners had the lowest FR (aRR 0.81). Conclusions: The neighbourhood’s characteristics played an important role in fertility patterns, independently of women’s individual characteristics. At the contextual level, the highest FR was found in the poorest settings, highlighting inequalities. At the individual level, the FR was highest among women with higher education and in their thirties.

State Medicaid expansion decisions and disparities in women’s cancer screening,"Sabik, Lindsay M.; Tarazi, Wafa W.; Bradley, Cathy J.","Background: There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening that stem from lack of health insurance. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands insurance coverage to many Americans, there are differences in availability of Medicaid coverage across states. Purpose: To understand the potential impact of Medicaid expansions on disparities in preventive care for low-income women by assessing pre-ACA breast and cervical cancer screening across states currently expanding and not expanding Medicaid to low-income adults. Methods: Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014) were used to consider differences in demographics among women for whom screening is recommended, including income and race/ethnicity, across expansion and nonexpansion states. Self-reported screening was compared by state expansion status overall, for the uninsured, and for low-income women. Logistic regressions were estimated to assess differences in self-reported screening across expansion and nonexpansion states controlling for demographics. Results: Women in states that are not expanding Medicaid had significantly lower odds of receiving recommended mammograms (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.95) or Pap tests (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.95).

Conclusions: As women in nonexpansion states remain uninsured and others gain coverage, existing disparities in cancer screening by race and socioeconomic status are likely to widen. Health risks and associated costs to underserved populations must be taken into account in ongoing debates over expansion.

KB concluded that the authors made an error of interpretation in discussing the effect of motherhood on earnings as differing among lower-and higher-wage workers. Specifically, KB argued that the authors use of conditional quantile regression and a de-meaned dependent variable render their empirical findings, that lowerwage women pay larger motherhood penalties relative to high-wage women, inaccurate. KB criticized both aspects of the model proposed by the authors. First, they pointed out that as a result of de-meaning the dependent hourly earnings variable, our dependent variable was wage deviations, rather than wage. The second issue KB raised was regarding the interpretation of quantile regression results lies with the inclusion of time-varying covariates in the regression model. Of prime concern, KB did not re-estimate the human capital model, which was the model central to all analyses in the original article.

Method: Participants were 1828 community adults (890 men; 938 women) aged 18–65 sampled from the Australian Electoral Roll responded to a mailed questionnaire. Participants provided demographic information and completed the SAB‐BN questionnaire. Results: Five components of stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs were identified; advantages of BN, minimization/low seriousness, unreliability, social distance, and personal responsibility. Stigma was low except on social distance and personal responsibility sub‐scales, which indicated negative attitudes toward people with bulimia. Men compared with women and lower compared with higher education and income groups held significantly higher stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs. There were few differences between age groups in stigma. Differences between demographic groups provides evidence for known‐groups validity. Discussion: The SAB‐BN questionnaire provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating stigma in relation to BN.

Systematic manipulations of the biological stress systems result in sex-specific compensatory stress responses and negative mood outcomes,"Ali, Nida; Nitschke, Jonas P.; Cooperman, Cory; Baldwin, Mark W.; Pruessner, Jens C.","Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with anxiety and mood disorders. One potential underlying mechanism is sex differences in physiological and psychological responses to stress; however, no studies to date have investigated this proposed mechanism experimentally. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, pharmacological challenges were administered to individually suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) prior to stress exposure, to investigate sex differences in the resulting cross talk among the physiological and psychological stress responses. Sex-specific compensatory patterns and psychological effects emerged when the stress systems were manipulated. Men demonstrated heightened SNS reactivity to stress when the HPA axis was suppressed, and greater HPA reactivity after SNS suppression. This ability to react appropriately to the stressor, even with one system, did not lead to significant negative mood effects. In women, higher baseline activation (but dampened reactivity to stress) of SNS or HPA was observed when the other system was suppressed. This was coupled with worsened mood in response to stress when either stress system was compromised. Our results indicate that men and women may be differentially sensitive to fluctuations of their stress systems. This might be a potential link that underlies the sexual dimorphism in vulnerability for psychopathology.

Teen birth across generations among non-Latino Whites and African–American women: The effect of race and neighborhood income,"Matoba, Nana; Edwards, Alexandra; Rankin, Kristin; DeSisto, Carla; Collins, James W.","Objectives: To examine the extent to which lifelong neighborhood income modifies the generational association of teen birth among White and AA women in Cook County, IL. Methods: Stratified and multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted on the Illinois transgenerational dataset of singleton births (1989–1991) to non-Latina White and AA mothers (born 1956–1976) with appended U.S. census income information. We calculated rates and risks of teen births according to race, maternal age, and lifelong neighborhood economic environment. Results: Teen birth occurred at a rate of 9.5% and 52.9% for White and AA women, respectively. White women whose mothers were teens when they were born had an over five-fold increased risk of becoming teen mothers themselves. For AA women, the risk was smaller, but statistically significant. For both races, women who experienced downward economic mobility had the highest risk of teen birth, while women with upward mobility had the lowest risk, even compared to women in lifelong high income neighborhoods. While White women exposed to lifelong low income had almost threefold increased risk of teen birth compared to those in lifelong high income neighborhoods, AA women in lifelong high and lifelong low income neighborhoods had similar risk of teen birth. Conclusions for Practice: Understanding the racial differences in intergenerational patterns of teen birth is important for effective program planning and policy making, given that interventions targeted at daughters of teen mothers may differ in effectiveness for White and AA teens.

The confidence gap predicts the gender pay gap among STEM graduates,"Sterling, Adina D.; Thompson, Marissa E.; Wang, Shiya; Kusimo, Abisola; Gilmartin, Shannon; Sheppard, Sheri","Women make less than men in some science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. While explanations for this gender pay gap vary, they have tended to focus on differences that arise for women and men after they have worked for a period of time. In this study we argue that the gender pay gap begins when women and men with earned degrees enter the workforce. Further, we contend the gender pay gap may arise due to cultural beliefs about the appropriateness of women and men for STEM professions that shape individuals’ self-beliefs in the form of self-efficacy. Using a three-wave NSF-funded longitudinal survey of 559 engineering and computer science students that graduated from over two dozen institutions in the United States between 2015 and 2017, we find women earn less than men, net of human capital factors like engineering degree and grade point average, and that the influence of gender on starting salaries is associated with self-efficacy. We find no support for a competing hypothesis that the importance placed on pay explains the pay gap; there is no gender difference in reported importance placed on pay. We also find no support for the idea that women earn less because they place more importance on workplace culture; women do value workplace culture more, but those who hold such values earn more rather than less. Overall, the results suggest that addressing cultural beliefs as manifested in self-beliefs—that is, the confidence gap—commands attention to reduce the gender pay gap.

"The development of the Healthy Pregnancy Stress Scale, and validation in a sample of low-income African American women","Frazier, Tyralynn; Hogue, Carol J.; Yount, Kathryn M.","Objectives: The association of stress with pregnancy health is well-known. However, few studies take a mixed methods approach to understand the stressors contributing to a woman’s pregnancy-related stress. Among African American women, exposure to stressors during pregnancy likely contributes to disparities in pregnancy health outcomes. This work aimed to understand the types and magnitude of stressors African American women are exposed to during pregnancy. Methods: Using a mixed methods research design, we developed and administered the Healthy Pregnancy Stress Scale to measure stressors within the stress environment of African American women living in poverty. Results: Exploratory factor analysis with one random split-half sample (N = 85) identified a two-factor model. Factor 1, defined as general pregnancy stressors, had significant loadings for ten items that ranged in magnitude from 0.319 to 0.724. Factor 2, defined as relationship strain, had significant loadings for three items ranging in magnitude from 0.613 to 0.856. Confirmatory factor analysis in the second random split-half sample (N = 88) showed a strong fit for the two factor model with factor loadings similar in magnitude.

Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results: In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off ≥ 10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off ≥ 10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off ≥ 15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values < .05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown seems particularly stressful for younger adults (< 35 years), women, people without work, and low income.

The effect of load uncertainty on neuromotor control in catching: Gender differences and short foreperiods,"Berg, William P.; Hughes, Michael R.","To reveal how the CNS copes with load uncertainty in catching, electromyography (EMG) was recorded in 15 females and 14 males while catching visually identical balls of known and unknown weights under varied (1–10 s) and constant (1 s) foreperiods (warning time). EMG integrals, which represented total muscle activity, were computed for three time intervals prior to the catch (anticipatory), and one interval after (compensatory). Load uncertainty caused the CNS to utilize an anticipatory strategy in several muscles, primarily during the ball-flight interval, characterized by preparation to catch balls of unknown weight by utilizing an average of 99.7% of the muscle activation used to catch the heaviest ball under the known weight condition. The constant 1 s foreperiod, which permitted precise temporal anticipation of ball release, did not influence the anticipatory strategy adopted by the CNS to cope with load uncertainty. There were no observed differences in the neuromotor control used by men and women to manage load uncertainty in catching, although there was an interesting difference in the way men and women employed the triceps to prepare to catch balls of a known weight.

In a study cohort of 1,216 normal young adults, we failed to find significant main effects of family SES on MD; however, previously observed main effects of family SES on regional gray matter volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) were partly replicated.

The findings suggested that the effects of parenthood on workforce participation were different for men and women. For women, parenthood was associated with decreasing participation in paid employment and fewer hours worked. For men, however, parenthood was not associated with decreased workforce participation and in some cases was associated with increased working hours. These findings had consequences for personal income, with 83–90 % of the total gender income gap in this cohort being attributed to gender differences in the effects of parenthood.

The flexibility paradox and spatial‐temporal dimensions of COVID‐19 remote work adaptation among dual‐earner mothers and fathers,"Parry, Ashley","There is an increased blurring of work and home life in contemporary society due to access to technology and the mass expansion of remote work during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Flexible working arrangements like remote work can lead to men self‐exploiting themselves in the workplace and women self‐exploiting themselves in the domestic sphere in the context of a work‐centric society that is reliant upon passion at work and traditional gender norms. This study extends Chung's ideas on gendered patterns in the flexibility paradox by examining spatial‐temporal dimensions of COVID‐19 remote work adaptation among an extreme sample: dual‐earner parents with young children. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted on Zoom with 20 mothers and 17 fathers working from home in the U.S. with children ages 5 and under between the summer of 2020 and the spring of 2021. Findings indicate that fathers' work is prioritized in spatio‐temporal terms whereas mothers' work is fragmented and dispersed. Gendered patterns in the flexibility paradox and labor shouldered by mothers as primary caregivers are considered as potential theoretical explanations for the privileging of fathers' workspace and work time.

The gender equity gap: A multistudy investigation of within-job inequality in equity-based awards,"Klein, Felice B.; Hill, Aaron D.; Hammond, Ryan; Stice-Lusvardi, Ryan","Laws in many countries mandate paying men and women equally when in similar jobs. Such laws, coupled with considerable organizational efforts, lead some scholars to contend that within-job pay inequality is no longer a source of the gender pay gap. We argue important differences in a widely used form of pay heretofore overlooked in existing studies—equity-based awards (i.e., pay where the value is tied to the employing organization’s stock, such as stock and stock options)—may cause underestimation of gender-based within-job pay inequality. Specifically, we theorize that because of differences in both why and how equity-based awards are distributed to employees compared to other forms of pay, a gender gap will exist in equity-based awards, with biased perceptions of retention driving the gap. Using a multimethod study with novel data from two technology organizations, archival data from publicly traded firms, and experimental data, we find consistent support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that using equity-based awards as a means to retain employees, and the rationale and processes associated with distributing such pay, can result in gender-based within-job inequality. Thus, our study sheds light on a previously overlooked form of inequality in the workplace while offering implications for both theory and practice.

Methods: The Living Conditions Surveys from the years 2007 and 2011 were used, including 44 138 adults aged under 65 years. A descriptive and stratified analysis was carried out along with the calculation of the concentration index and a multivariate logistic regression jointly and separately by gender. The dependent variable was unmet dental care needs and the independent variables were income, employment status, gender, age, education and chronic disease. A dummy variable was created for the year of survey completion as a proxy measure for the economic crisis. The SPSS V.20 software was used. Results: During the period under analysis, the unmet needs for dental services increased (from 6.2% to 7.2%) along with the concentration index (from −0.1412 to −0.189). The main correlations with unmet needs were: unemployment (OR = 1.46), lower income (OR = 2.44 for the income quintile) and the year 2011 with respect to 2007 (OR 1.13).

The link between intimate partner violence and spousal resource inequality in lower- and middle-income countries,"Liu, Chia; Olamijuwon, Emmanuel","Objective: There is an increasing need to understand how differential levels of resource inequality between spouses are associated with women's experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) in lower- and middle-income countries across four regions. This study aims to focus on four areas of relative power and resources between couples in a partnership: employment, job skills, earnings, and household making-decision across four lower- and middle-income regions. Method: Data on 150,623 women was drawn from the most recent, harmonized Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for 24 countries in West-Central Africa (WCA), East-Southern Africa (ESA), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and South Asia (SA). Leveraging an event history framework, we fitted mixture cure models to illuminate both the likelihood of never experiencing IPV and the onset of IPV among women in their first union across the four regions. Results: We found that women who are not in the labor market are less likely to experience violence compared to those who are in all places except MENA. Among couples in which both partners are in the labor market, women with lower job skills than their partner are less likely to experience violence. Inequality in earnings is associated with the onset of intimate partner violence in ESA and SA. Similarly, inequality in household decision-making is associated with the onset of the first spousal violence but only in ESA, MENA, and SA. Conclusion: This study found vast heterogeneity in the different measures of spousal resource inequality and women's experience of IPV across LMIC settings.

We then explored whether the magnitude of these associations was correlated with cues of environmental harshness and unpredictability (youth external mortality and income inequality) and mating competition (sex ratio) from the city level. Results indicated that self-reported violent victimization is associated with an increased chance of engagement in health-risk behaviors in all Brazilian state capitals, for both males and females, but the magnitude of these associations varies in relation to broader environmental factors, such as the cities' age-specific mortality rates, and specifically for females, income inequality and sex ratio. In addition to introducing a novel theoretical and empirical approach to contextual effects on adolescent health-risk behaviors, our findings reinforce the need to consider synergies between people's life experiences and the conditions where they live, when studying health-risk behaviors in adolescence.

The social determinants of substance use associated with deaths of despair: Individual risks and population impacts,"Blair, Alexandra; Siddiqi, Arjumand","As the incidence of deaths from external causes including poisonings, suicide, and alcohol-related liver disease, increases in countries such as the United States and Canada, a better understanding of the fundamental social determinants of the substance use underlying these so-called 'deaths of despair', at the population level, is needed. Using data from the nationally representative data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003, 2015–2016, 2018 cycles) (N = 30,729), the independent associations between age, sex, marital status, immigrant status, race/ethnicity, education, income, rurality, affective health and the use of illicit substances, opioids (without distinction for prescription status), problematic levels of alcohol, and combined past-year use (≥2) of substances, were explored using multivariate logistic regression, marginal risk, and population attributable fraction estimation, with propensity score-adjusted sensitivity analyses. Males, those who were under 29 years, without a partner, born in Canada, White, or had an affective disorder reported both higher use of individual substances and multiple substances in the past year. Social determinants appear to explain a substantial proportion of substance use patterns overall. Between 10% and 45% of illicit substance, problematic alcohol, and polysubstance use prevalence was attributable to non-partnered marital status, non-immigrant status, and White race/ethnicity. Of opioid use prevalence, 25% was attributable to White race/ethnicity, 13% to affective disorder status and 4% to lower-income. Though not all substance use will result in substance-related morbidity or mortality, these findings highlight the role of social determinants in shaping the intermediary behavioural outcomes that shape population-level risk of 'deaths of despair'.

Material and Methods: Using the Colorado birth certificate registry from 2007 to 2014, receipt of prenatal care was assessed retrospectively in 2,497 women with pre-existing diabetes. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between high (>$50,000), medium ($25,000–50,000), and low (<$25,000) income strata and receipt of first trimester prenatal care by birth year, adjusted for demographics. Results: High, medium, and low income represented 29.5%, 19.0%, and 51.5% of the cohort, respectively. Women with high income were more likely to receive first trimester care than women with low income from 2007 [adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 2.16 (1.18, 3.96)] through 2013 [1.66 (1.01, 2.73)], but significant differences were no longer observed in 2014 [1.59 (0.89, 2.84)]. The likelihood of receiving first trimester prenatal care was not significantly different between medium- and low-income strata from 2007 [1.07 (0.66, 1.74)] through 2014 [0.77 (0.48, 1.23)]. Conclusions: From 2007 to 2013, women in Colorado with diabetes were more likely to receive early prenatal care if they were in the highest income stratum than in the lowest stratum. In 2014, receipt of first trimester care became equitable across all income strata. Future work should examine national patterns of income with receipt of prenatal care and outcomes among women with pre-existing diabetes.

Trends in school‐neighbourhood inequalities and youth obesity: Repeated cross‐sectional analyses of the public schools in the state of California,"Matsuzaki, Mika; Sanchez‐Vaznaugh, Emma V.; Alexovitz, Kelsey; Acosta, Maria E.; Sánchez, Brisa N.","Background: It is currently unknown whether the relationship between affluence of school neighbourhoods and prevalence of youth overweight/obesity is uniform across demographic subgroups and areal context in the United States. Methods: We examined association between school-neighbourhood income tertiles and school-level overweight/obesity (OVOB) prevalence, using data on body mass index of fifth, seventh, and nineth graders who attended public schools in California in 2001 and 2010 (n = 1 584 768), using multiple logistic regression models. Results: Overall, OVOB prevalence was higher in lower-income school neighbourhoods, with a steeper income-OVOB gradient for girls. Among boys, the gradient became steeper in 2010 than 2000. Among Asian and White girls, the negative gradients were steepest in rural areas. For African–American students in all areas and Latino boys in rural areas, there was less clear evidence of inverse income-OVOB gradients. Addition of fast-food restaurant availability to the models did not change the observed inverse school-neighbourhood income–obesity gradients.

Turnover or turnaway? Competing risks analysis of male and female IT professionals’ job mobility and relative pay gap,"Joseph, Damien; Ang, Soon; Slaughter, Sandra A.","This study draws on distributive justice, human capital, and stigmatization theories to hypothesize relationships between relative pay gap and patterns of job mobility. Our study also expands the criterion space of job mobility by contrasting different job destinations when information technology (IT) professionals make job moves. We examine three job moves: (a) turnover to another IT job in a different firm, (b) turnaway-within to a non-IT job, and (c) turnaway-between to a different firm and a non-IT job. We analyze work histories spanning 28 years for 359 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We report three major findings. First, as hypothesized, larger relative pay gaps significantly increase the likelihood of job mobility. Second, IT males and IT females have different job mobility patterns. IT males are more likely to turn over than turn away-between when faced with a relative pay gap. Further, and contrary to predictions from human capital theory, IT males are more likely to turn away-within than turn over. This surprising finding suggests that the ubiquitous use of IT in other business functions may have increased the value of IT skills for non-IT jobs and reduced the friction of moving from IT to other non-IT positions. Third, and consistent with stigmatization arguments, IT females are more likely to turn away from IT than to turn over when faced with a relative pay gap. In fact, to reduce relative pay gaps, IT females tend to take on lower-status jobs that pay less than their IT jobs. We conclude this study with important theoretical, practical, and policy implications.

"Urbanicity, income, and mammography-use disparities among American Indian women","Christensen, Eric W.; Pelzl, Casey E.; Patel, Bhavika K.; Carlos, Ruth C.; Rula, Elizabeth Y.","Introduction: Reported breast cancer screening among American Indian women is consistently below that of White women. The last claims-based trends were from 1991 to 2001. This study updates mammography trends for American Indian women and examines the impact of race, urbanicity, and income on long-term mammography use. Methods: This was a multi-year (2005−2019), retrospective study of women aged 40−89 years using a 5% sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries residing in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Washington. This study used multivariable logistic regression to examine the impact of urbanicity and income on receiving mammography for American Indian women compared with that for White women. Analyses were conducted in 2022. Results: Overall, annual age-adjusted mammography use declined from 205 per 1,000 in 2005 to 165 per 1,000 in 2019. The slope of these declines was significantly steeper (difference = −2.41, p<0.001) for White women (−3.06) than for American Indian women (−0.65). Mammography-use odds across all urbanicity categories were less for American Indian women than for White women compared with those of their respective metropolitan counterparts (e.g., rural: 0.96, 95% CI=0.77, 1.20 for American Indian women and 1.47, 99% CI=1.39, 1.57 for White women). Although residing in higher-income communities was not associated with mammography use for American Indian women, it was 31% higher for White women (OR=1.31, 99% CI=1.28, 1.34). Conclusions: The disparity in annual age-adjusted mammography use between American Indian and White women narrowed between 2005 and 2019. However, the association of urbanicity and community income on mammography use differs substantially between American Indian and White women. Policies to reduce disparities need to consider these differences.

Women in academic science: A changing landscape,"Ceci, Stephen J.; Ginther, Donna K.; Kahn, Shulamit; Williams, Wendy M.","Much has been written in the past two decades about women in academic science careers, but this literature is contradictory. Many analyses have revealed a level playing field, with men and women faring equally, whereas other analyses have suggested numerous areas in which the playing field is not level. The only widely-agreed-upon conclusion is that women are underrepresented in college majors, graduate school programs, and the professoriate in those fields that are the most mathematically intensive, such as geoscience, engineering, economics, mathematics/ computer science, and the physical sciences. In other scientific fields (psychology, life science, social science), women are found in much higher percentages. In this monograph, we undertake extensive life-course analyses comparing the trajectories of women and men in math-intensive fields with those of their counterparts in non-math-intensive fields in which women are close to parity with or even exceed the number of men. We begin by examining early-childhood differences in spatial processing and follow this through quantitative performance in middle childhood and adolescence, including high school coursework. We then focus on the transition of the sexes from high school to college major, then to graduate school, and, finally, to careers in academic science. We conclude by suggesting that although in the past, gender discrimination was an important cause of women’s underrepresentation in scientific academic careers, this claim has continued to be invoked after it has ceased being a valid cause of women’s underrepresentation in math-intensive fields. Consequently, current barriers to women’s full participation in mathematically intensive academic science fields are rooted in pre-college factors and the subsequent likelihood of majoring in these fields, and future research should focus on these barriers rather than misdirecting attention toward historical barriers that no longer account for women’s underrepresentation in academic science.

"Women's suicide in low-, middle-, and high-income countries: Do laws discriminating against women matter?","Cai, Ziyi; Canetto, Silvia Sara; Chang, Qingsong; Yip, Paul S. F.","Background: Women's suicide is a serious public health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This study explored whether institutional discrimination against women, as manifested in formal and informal laws, is relevant to country's income-level variability in women's suicide mortality. It also examined which discriminatory laws are associated with LMIC women's suicides. Methods: Scores on laws discriminating against women, across 176 countries, were obtained from the Gender, Institutions and Development Database. Male-to-female (M/F) 2017 suicide ratios were the index of women's propensity for suicide. The mediating role of laws discriminating against women on the association between country's income level and M/F suicide ratio was analysed by bootstrapping method. Regression analyses examined which discriminatory laws were associated with LMIC women's suicide rates. Results: LMIC had significantly smaller M/F suicide ratios than high-income countries. Institutional discrimination mediated the association between country’s income-level and M/F suicide ratio (total effect: β = −0.13, 95% CI [ −0.26, −0.01]; direct effect: β = −0.06, 95% CI [ −0.20, 0.08]; indirect effect: β = −0.07, 95% CI [ −0.15, −0.02]). In LMIC, higher levels of discrimination against women in laws about access to productive and financial resources (β = −0.69, p < 0.001), civil liberties (β = −0.60, p < 0.001), and in family law (β = −0.57, p < 0.001) were associated with smaller M/F suicide ratios after controlling for male suicide rates and sex ratios at birth. Conclusions: The relatively high suicide rates recorded among women in LMIC might be related to the higher level of institutional discrimination women experience in these countries. In LMIC, where, by law, women had restricted access to productive and financial assets and to justice, and/or unequal rights with regard to citizenship, household-responsibilities, divorce, and inheritance, M/F suicide ratios were lower—that is, women's suicide rates were higher.

Gonadal sex-steroids are well known to play a major role in sexual differentiation of the vertebrate brain, but far less is known regarding the role of sex-chromosomes. Our review focuses on this latter issue by bridging together two literatures that have to date been largely disconnected. We first consider 'bottom-up' genetic and molecular studies focused on sex-chromosome gene content and regulation. This literature nominates specific sex-chromosome genes that could drive developmental sex-differences by virtue of their sex-biased expression and their functions within the brain. We then consider the complementary 'top down' view, from magnetic resonance imaging studies that map sex- and sex chromosome effects on regional brain anatomy, and link these maps to regional gene-expression within the brain. By connecting these top-down and bottom-up approaches, we emphasize the potential role of X-linked genes in driving sex-biased brain development and outline key goals for future work in this field.

"Faculty Salary Inversion, Compression, and Market Salary Gap in California State University Business Schools","Homer, P.M.; Hunt, H.G.; Runyon, L.R.","Extant literature has examined salary compression and inversion in US academic institutions including arguments that compression constitutes a form of age discrimination. We assess these phenomena via estimated full rank salaries (across nine campuses in the teaching-oriented California State University (CSU) system) based on the notion that in the absence of compression and inversion, forecasted full rank salaries should be comparable across faculty ranks. Our results show that salary compression is present across all sampled Colleges of Business (COB), but not in other academic CSU colleges. In addition, the patterns of compression support the notion that salaries in CSU COBs are becoming more inverted as the gap between market and current salaries increases.

Compensation of Academic Research Computing and Data Professionals,"Maimone, C.; Brown, C.; Grash, K.; Reidy, C.; Stauffer, A.","Previous work identified low compensation levels as a barrier to recruitment and retention in the Research Computing and Data (RCD) field. In order to better understand the characteristics of RCD compensation, a 2021 survey of RCD professionals in the United States gathered salary information from 480 full-time, currently-employed RCD professionals, including 394 respondents working at non-medical academic institutions. The median salary reported for academic institutions was $90,000 ($80,000 for individual contributor levels), with variation observed across respondents' position levels, gender, ethnicity, education, years of experience, and geography. While RCD roles require a combination of expertise in two fields — research and technology — the median compensation for academic RCD professionals falls below that for either of these fields independently. The variation in compensation within the academic RCD field is also found to be less than the variation in the non-academic technology industry or for academic research faculty positions, with salary ranges limited at the upper end. Smaller differences in compensation between respondents based on years of experience and education were observed compared to the broader labor market.

Quantifying the Impact of Research Productivity on Salary in Academic Radiation Oncology,"Mulligan, K.M.; Moore, N.; Holliday, E.; Spratt, D.E.; Wang, M.; Zaorsky, N.G.","Purpose/Objective(s)Academic physicians typically do not receive a salary based on individual publications; however, publications are necessary for promotion, and the impact of publication productivity among ranks on salary is unknown. The objective of this was to evaluate salary changes associated with publication productivity among academic radiation oncologists.Materials/MethodsRadiation oncologist faculty-level academic productivity data were obtained, including the h-index, m-index, number of papers, and number of citations, based on prior work (Holliday et al, 2014). The AAMC and MGMA Provider Compensation Data from 2017 provided percentile-level salaries. The delta in salary was calculated for each delta in rank the publication metrics among ranks. The primary outcome was delta in salary per delta in h-index; additional calculations were performed for delta in m-index and delta in publications.ResultsA total of 986 radiation oncologists were included. For assistant professor, median salary was $367,000, average h-index 6.8, m-index 0.68, 15.7 publications. For associate professor, median salary was $452,000, average h-index 14, m-index 0.87, 41.8 publications. For full professor, median salary was $520,000, average h-index 31.3, m-index 1.33, 118.7 publications. For chair (not mutually exclusive from full professor), median salary was $720,000, average h-index 34.8, m-index 1.36, 146.8 publications. The delta in salary per delta in rank and the associated changes in h-index, m-index, and publications are shown in Table 1. The average change in salary from assistant to associate professor is $11,805.56 / h-index, $447,368.42 / m-index, and $3,256.70 / publication; for associate to full it is $3,930.64 / h-index, $147,826.09 / m-index, and $884.27 / publication; and for full to chair it is $57,142.86 / h-index, and $7,117.44 / publication.ConclusionThis work provides the average change in salary among academic ranks based on changes in research publication productivity.

Millennials and the gender wage gap: do millennial women face a glass ceiling?,"Garcia, G.A.; Gonzales-Miranda, D.R.; Gallo, O.; Roman Calderon, J.P.","Purpose This study aims to measure the gender wage gap among millennial workers in Colombia and determine if there is a marked wage difference between millennial women and men. Furthermore, this study analyzes whether millennial women face a glass ceiling, that is, whether there is a larger gender wage gap among workers earning relatively high wages. Design/methodology/approach The study data included a sample of 2,144 millennial workers employed in 11 organizations located in the five main cities of Colombia. Oaxaca-Blinder econometric methods of wage decomposition were used to calculate both raw and adjusted gender wage gaps. The latter results in estimating the gender wage gap while controlling for observable characteristics related to individual, family, and labor. In addition, wage decompositions by education levels were carried out to approximate the extent of the glass ceiling among young workers. Findings The results show that millennial workers in Colombia face gender inequality in the labor market and that professional millennial women experience a distinct glass ceiling. The adjusted gender wage gap is 9.5%, and this gap increases with education level, increasing to nearly 14% among college-educated workers. Research limitations/implications The empirical results are supported by a self-report survey of millennial workers. An important limitation is that the data include millennial workers employed in the formal sector and exclude the informal sector (activities not regulated or protected by the state), which represents an important part of the economy in developing countries. Originality/value This paper contributes to the empirical literature on gender wage inequality for younger workers.

Analyzing data from 138 empirical studies covering 35 countries, we obtain evidence of gender heterogeneity in prosocial behaviors under different gender-related institutional environments/logics. Our meta-analysis helps obtain several important findings. For instance, a gender gap in pro-environmental behaviors is more likely to be observed in societies/countries with low gender egalitarianism with women showing less prosocial behavior than their men counterparts. Moreover, women under the same institutional environments also show significantly more anti-corruption behaviors than do their men counterparts, while this difference is much smaller (i.e., with smaller effect size) given the institutions of high gender egalitarianism.

Salary transparency and gender pay inequality: Evidence from Canadian universities,"Lyons, E.; Zhang, L.","Research Abstract: We examine whether salary transparency influences gender pays inequality in the context of Canadian universities by exploiting a policy change enacted in one Canadian province that required salary disclosure through a publicly searchable database, thus lowering the cost of monitoring the gender pay gap. We find that, on average, salary disclosure improves gender pay equality but institutions respond in different ways. Despite little media attention around gender equality at the time of the policy, institutions most likely to anticipate higher scrutiny, such as top ranked institutions, respond more aggressively to improve gender pay equality-both in terms of the magnitude and type of response. Combined, our findings suggest that the extent of change from salary transparency depends on the reduction in monitoring costs and organizational characteristics. Managerial Abstract: Salary transparency has been implemented in various ways around the world as a strategy by firms and policy makers to reduce the gender pay gap. However, whether and how it can achieve this in practice is unclear. We examine a salary transparency policy that mandated disclosure to the public through an online database in one Canadian province by comparing the change in gender pay inequality in that province relative to the change in the gender pay gap in provinces without disclosure. We find that salary transparency improves average gender pay equality primarily within the most visible organizations that likely anticipate high levels of public scrutiny. Our findings imply that facilitating low-cost public monitoring of gender inequalities can motivate organizations to enact change. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2023,/,Strategic Management Journal,,,2005-34,,10.1002/smj.3483,,#916,Lyons 2023,"",""

International differences in the CEO gender pay gap,"Chen, X.; Torsin, W.; Tsang, A.","Research question/issueThis study examines (i) whether and to what extent differences in the level of compensation paid to men and women can be observed at the corporate executive (i.e., CEOs) level in an international setting and (ii) whether and how country-level attitudes toward gender equality help explain the heterogeneity in the CEO gender pay gap observed across countries.Research findings/insightsUsing executive compensation data from 27 countries over the 2001-2016 period, this study documents a 3.3% average difference in the level of executive compensation between male and female CEOs in countries around the world. The results further indicate that firms that transition from a male to a female CEO tend to have a significantly lower level of compensation. These results are robust when controlling for an array of key CEO attributes including education, age, and work experience and when US firms are excluded from the sample. Our findings also suggest that attitudes related to gender equality across countries can be an important factor explaining the CEO gender pay gap observed in our study.Theoretical/academic implicationsThe results of our study suggest the existence of a CEO gender pay gap at the international level. Specifically, our study suggests that the difference in pay between men and women, which is well documented in the literature of many countries, not only applies to regular employees in an economy but can also be generalized to those who work at the chief executive level. More importantly, our study suggests that a country's institutional environment vis-à-vis gender equality can contribute to the gender pay differences observed in various countries around the world.Practitioner/policy implicationsWe provide evidence supporting the existence of a gender pay gap using executive compensation data at the CEO level. We further show that country-level institutional characteristics related to gender equality partly contribute to gender pay differences between male and female CEOs across countries.

"Are consumers equally willing to pay more for brands that aim for sustainability, positive societal contribution, and inclusivity as for brands that are perceived as exclusive? Generational, Gender, and Country Differences","Goedertier, F.; Weijters, B.; Van Den Bergh, J.","This study explores consumer preferences for brands that emphasize sustainability and inclusivity, and for brands perceived as exclusive and trendy. Consumer data obtained via a large-scale survey involving 24,798 participants across 20 countries and one special administrative region (SAR) are used to understand how willingness to pay (WTP) for these brand types varies globally, accounting for demographic factors like generation, gender, and country. A substantial body of literature highlights growing consumer interest in brands that stand for sustainability and inclusivity, challenging traditional notions that luxury and exclusivity primarily drive brand value. Despite persistent skepticism among some business executives about consumers' actual versus claimed willingness to spend more for sustainable and inclusive brands, academics and commercial researchers increasingly signal a shift in purchasing behavior that is influenced by socio-ecological factors. This research aims to provide empirical data on consumer WTP across different demographics and countries/regions, thereby contributing to academic discussions and offering insights for managerial decision making. The study frames its investigation around four research questions, to explore how consumers' WTP for exclusive and inclusive brands varies across generations, genders, and countries/regions. It employs a robust methodological approach, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data. This ensures that the constructs of brand inclusiveness and exclusivity are comparable across diverse cultural contexts. Significant gender, generational, and country/region differences are observed. When comparing generations, the findings indicate that GenZ consumers have a higher WTP for sustainable/inclusive brands (compared to older, GenX, and Baby Boomer generations). Similar patterns are found when considering WTP for exclusive, on-trend brands. In terms of gender, women are observed to have a higher WTP for sustainable/inclusive brands, but a lower WTP for exclusive, on-trend brands compared to men. Finally, compared to consumers originating from certain European countries, we find that consumers living in certain Asian countries/regions have a significantly higher WTP for inclusive and sustainable brands, as well as for exclusive/on-trend brands. The study underscores the complexities of consumer behavior in the global market, highlighting the coexistence of traditional preferences for exclusive, trendy brands and preferences for brands that embrace sustainability and inclusivity.",2024,/,Sustainability,16,9,3879 (20 pp.),,10.3390/su16093879,,#921,Goedertier 2024,"",""
Overeducation and the gender pay gap in Italy,"Castagnetti, C.; Rosti, L.; Topfer, M.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the pivotal role of overeducation in explaining the unexplained part of the gender pay gap (GPG), i.e. the component usually attributed to gender discrimination in the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a large Italian data set (ISFOL PLUS 2005-2014) to estimate the GPG among properly educated and overeducated workers. The model simultaneously accounts for both participation bias and endogeneity bias by applying an extension of the Heckman’s two-stage procedure. Findings - Estimates show that the GPG is significantly higher among overeducated than among properly educated workers because women’s unobservable characteristics driving female employment into overeducation also drag down female wages more than men’s unobservable characteristics drag down male wages. Correcting for the participation and overeducation decisions, the unexplained portion of the GPG disappears among overeducated workers, while it remains significant among properly educated individuals. Originality/value - The authors draw the conclusion that overeducation is, first, a first-best matching for individuals (both men and women) compensating with more education for their lower productive characteristics. Second, it may be a signaling device for women spending their useless-for-the-job diploma to inform employers on their valuable though unobservable productive characteristics and fight gender wage discrimination. The results favor education as a tool of counteracting gender discrimination. Hence, as females are less overeducated than males despite their larger representation in higher education, there should not be concern that expanding higher education will disadvantage females.",2018,/,International Journal of Manpower,39,5,710-30,,10.1108/IJM-12-2016-0235,,#922,Castagnetti 2018,"",""

How Long Do Early Career Decisions Follow Women? The Impact of Employer History on the Gender Wage Gap,"Monti, H.; Stinson, M.; Zehr, L.","We add to the gender wage gap literature by considering how characteristics of past employers are correlated with current wages and whether differences between the work histories of men and women are related to the persistent gender wage gap. Our hypothesis is that women have less exposure to higher paying industries and firms and more exposure to lower paying ones over the course of their careers and this history is correlated with male-female earnings differences in middle age. We use unique administrative employer history data to conduct a decomposition exercise to determine the impact of past employer characteristics relative to current employer characteristics, both at the mean and across the wage distribution. Consistent with past literature, we find that women in their forties work for lower paying firms than men, even within the same industry, and this difference accounts for almost a quarter of the wage gap observed at this point in time. In addition, we find that length and magnitude of past exposure to high and low paying industries and firms continues to exert influence on the wages observed in middle age. If women spent similar amounts of career time as men at employers with pay premiums similar to those of the employers of men, the gender wage gap would be 5% - 8% lower. The largest effects are found at the median, where differences in pay levels between men and women’s past employers explain approximately 8% of the gender wage gap.

Pay inequality and gender dynamics in top executive positions,"Amore, M.D.; Garofalo, O.","Research Question/Issue: Contributing to ongoing debates on the determinants of diversity at the helm of companies, we investigate the relationship between executives' gender and pay inequality within the top executive team.Research Findings/InsightsUsing a panel data set of US listed firms, we find that a greater inequality in executive pay is positively associated with the exit of female executives from the firm's top executive team. This effect is economically larger when the starting level of female representation in the executive team is low, when the firm uses more variable compensation to reward executives, and when the firm operates in geographic areas featuring stronger aversion toward income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study expands existing knowledge on the organizational and external factors promoting gender diversity at the top of companies. Although this literature has widely analyzed women's entry into corporate positions, exit has been largely neglected. Our study fills this gap by documenting significant gender differences in the relationship between executives' pay inequality and exit from the top executive team. In so doing, we connect the literatures on gender diversity and executive pay distribution, which have developed in a rather independent manner. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Drawing on insights from corporate governance and behavioral economics, this study offers novel evidence to policy-makers interested in addressing the under-explored challenges associated with the retention of women in corporate positions and their upward mobility within the corporate hierarchy.

"Temporal and Spatial Analysis of the Wage Gap for Women and Underrepresented Minorities in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Workforce","Nikkhah Manesh, Saba","The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has failed to solve persistent labor shortage problems or to fill the labor demand in the workforce by recruiting from untapped/underrepresented groups such as Women and Underrepresented Minorities (WUMs). There have been several studies on diversity and inclusion in the AEC industry, but the issue still persists, as the AEC industry has failed to solve these issues. If the industry better understands the status of wage gaps by gender and race, as well as how the industry has performed in terms of providing comparable wages for the workforce over time, along with the geographical distribution and spatiality of the wage gaps, the industry can focus on the target wage gap issues and improve its chances of attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Therefore, in this study, using American Community Survey (ACS) data source, the researcher first investigated WUM’s participation, and workforce diversity by gender and race. Secondly, the researcher studied the gender and race wage gaps and differences using Welch’s t test in the AEC occupations temporally, with and without controlling for the education level of the workforce. Finally, the researcher analyzed the spatial variation of the gender wage gap across the United States using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) approach to provide an additional dimension to the study of wage disparity, not only because analyzing wage gaps based solely on the national average may mask regional differences, but also because wage gaps have major roles in area-based public policies that are targeted to eliminate wage disparities. The results indicate that women have been more underrepresented in construction than engineering professions, whereas minorities have been more underrepresented in engineering jobs. Additionally, the gender wage gap in construction occupations is considerably lower than Architecture and Engineering (A&E), contrary to race wage gaps, where the opposite is true. Furthermore, there are significant racial/ethnic wage differences (minorities relative to whites) in construction jobs, and the race wage gaps had an increase among college-educated minorities. In the A&E industry, the African American to White wage gap has increased for the majority of the African Americans who had lower than ""above bachelor"" degrees. Surprisingly, the gender wage gap increased in 2015 compared to 2011 with higher education levels in A&E professions, contrary to construction, in which the gender wage gap is the least for the most educated women in all sample years. This study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of workforce diversity and inclusion by identifying the temporal changes in wage gaps in the AEC industry by education, and analyzing the spatiality of the gender wage gaps. The research also contributes to the AEC industry by identifying the target workforce by education, gender, and race, which requires the industry’s attention. The industry’s understanding of the wage disparities can help practitioners to realize and address wage gaps, which will help them to improve in attracting and retaining WUMs to the workforce.

Peer bargaining and productivity in teams: Gender and the inequitable division of pay,"Pierce, Lamar; Wang, Laura W.; Zhang, Dennis J.","Problem description: A recent trend in personnel operations is to reduce hierarchy and allow employee teams to self-manage tasks, responsibilities, and rewards. Yet, we know little about how this arrangement relates to worker productivity and fairness. Academic/practical relevance: We provide the first firm-based evidence that when service teams are allowed to allocate compensation internally, the ensuing peer-bargaining process can generate inequitable outcomes for women. Methodology: We demonstrate this using fixed-effect models to identify productivity and peer-bargaining traits in 932 workers at 32 large Chinese beauty salons. We measure individual productivity through service and prepaid card sales and measure bargaining through the division of team-based commissions. We also build a parsimonious bargaining model to explain our empirical results. Results: Although productivity and bargaining outcomes are positively correlated, female workers consistently receive bargaining outcomes below their productivity level, whereas men are consistently overcompensated. Importantly, we provide evidence that our results can only be explained by a combination of higher prosociality and lower bargaining power in women. We also demonstrate that the resulting inequity is positively correlated with shorter tenure. Managerial implications: Our findings provide unique organizational evidence on how bargaining among peers relates to productivity in service operations. We show that the discriminatory social dynamics observed throughout society are evident in operational designs that delegate decision rights to teams and that the magnitude in these systems is at least as large as that observed in traditional hierarchical pay systems. Managers must anticipate and mitigate this gender-based inequity because it is in and of itself an operational performance issue, and because of the myriad of productivity, retention, and ethical implications that can result from peer-based bargaining. © 2020 INFORMS.",2021,,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,23,4,933-951,,10.1287/MSOM.2019.0821,,#934,Pierce 2021,"",""
Pay No Attention to the Model Behind the Curtain,"Stark, P.B.","Many widely used models amount to an elaborate means of making up numbers—but once a number has been produced, it tends to be taken seriously and its source (the model) is rarely examined carefully. Many widely used models have little connection to the real-world phenomena they purport to explain. Common steps in modeling to support policy decisions, such as putting disparate things on the same scale, may conflict with reality. Not all costs and benefits can be put on the same scale, not all uncertainties can be expressed as probabilities, and not all model parameters measure what they purport to measure. These ideas are illustrated with examples from seismology, wind-turbine bird deaths, soccer penalty cards, gender bias in academia, and climate policy.",2022,/,Pure and Applied Geophysics,,,4121-45,,10.1007/s00024-022-03137-2,,#935,Stark 2022,"",""
The Effects of Teachers' Unions on the Gender Pay Gap among U.S. Public School Teachers,"Han, E.S.","This study examines the effect of teachers' unions on the gender pay gap among teachers under various legal environments, using nationally representative district–teacher matched data. To identify union effects, I employ propensity score matching, considering both contractual status and teacher union density in each district as a treatment. I find that teachers' unions significantly reduce the gender pay gap, and the union effects vary by legal environment. I also find that unions reduce teacher attrition for female teachers, but not for male teachers, thereby decreasing the gender pay gap by helping female teachers accumulate experience.

People’s attitude towards willingness-to-pay for environmental protection in Pakistan,"Shahzad, Tahir; Shah, Syed Tahir Hussain; Rais, Syed Imran; Mansoor, Abdul; Zaman, Khalid","Recent environmental research has found that people with higher incomes and in more developed countries are more willing to pay (WTP) to protect their environment than people in developing countries. Based on this assumption, the study investigated Pakistani citizens’ attitudes toward environmental protection, precisely their willingness to pay higher prices and taxes to preserve the natural environment. The research was carried out in three Punjab cities (Hasan Abdal, Wah, and Taxila) and four KPK cities (Abbottabad, Havelian, Mansehra, and Haripur). The selected cities are home to knowledgeable people who work in various universities, schools, hospitals, medical colleges, and nearby industrial estates and have a sense of environmental protection and can understand the healthcare issues related to environmental damages. The survey was divided into two sections: one about the participants’ socio-demographic information and the other about people’s willingness to pay higher prices and taxes to protect the environment. Four hundred and sixty-two people took part in the survey, and the data were analyzed using the bootstrap regression approach. The results show that gender has a detrimental impact, although population density and education positively impact a country’s willingness to pay for environmental protection (WTPEP). Women are more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior than men, resulting in disparities in their perceptions of male and female respondents in the study. People who live in crowded places tend to pay for environmental protection because of population density, healthcare difficulties, and air pollution. The respondents are well-versed in the externalities of environmental pollution; they are hopeful about paying for a better healthcare environment. Other criteria, such as the respondent’s income, health status, total pollution level in the country, and per capita income, enable respondents to pay for environmental preservation to achieve long-term sustainable growth. The government must embrace air quality regulations and empower its citizens by offering better healthcare services since they are enthusiastic about paying higher taxes and fees to protect the environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,29,35,52635-52654,,10.1007/s11356-021-18177-9,,#939,Shahzad 2022,"",""
A mismatch between self-efficacy and performance: Undergraduate women in engineering tend to have lower self-efficacy despite earning higher grades than men,"Whitcomb, Kyle M.; Kalender, Z. Yasemin; Nokes-Malach, Timothy J.; Schunn, Christian D.; Singh, Chandralekha","There is a significant underrepresentation of women in many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors and careers. Prior research has shown that self-efficacy can be a critical factor in student learning, and that there is a tendency for women to have lower self-efficacy than men in STEM disciplines. This study investigates gender differences in the relationship between engineering students' self-efficacy and course grades in foundational courses. By focusing on engineering students, we examined these gender differences simultaneously in four STEM disciplines (mathematics, engineering, physics, and chemistry) among the same population. Using survey data collected longitudinally at three time points and course grade data from five cohorts of engineering students at a large US-based research university, effect sizes of gender differences are calculated using Cohen's d on two measures: responses to survey items on discipline-specific self-efficacy and course grades in all first-year foundational courses and second-year mathematics courses. In engineering, physics, and mathematics courses, we find sizeable discrepancies between self-efficacy and performance, with men appearing significantly more confident than women despite small or reverse direction differences in grades. In chemistry, women earn higher grades and have higher self-efficacy. The patterns are consistent across courses within each discipline. All self-efficacy gender differences close by the fourth year except physics self-efficacy. The disconnect between self-efficacy and course grades across subjects provides useful clues for targeted interventions to promote equitable learning environments. The most extreme disconnect occurs in physics and may help explain the severe underrepresentation of women in ""physics-heavy"" engineering disciplines, highlighting the importance of such interventions. © 2020, CC BY.",2020,,,,,,,,,#940,Whitcomb 2020,"",""

American postdoctoral salaries do not account for growing disparities in cost of living,"Sainburg, T.","The National Institute of Health (NIH) sets postdoctoral (postdoc) trainee stipend levels that many American institutions and investigators use as a basis for postdoc salaries. Although salary standards are held constant across universities, the cost of living in those universities' cities and towns vary widely. Across non-postdoc jobs, more expensive cities pay workers higher wages that scale with an increased cost of living. This work investigates the extent to which postdoc wages account for cost of living differences. More than 27,000 postdoc salaries across all US universities are analyzed alongside measures of regional differences in cost of living. We find that postdoc salaries do not account for cost of living differences, in contrast with the broader labor market in the same cities and towns. Despite a modest increase in income in high cost of living areas, real (cost of living adjusted) postdoc salaries differ by 29% ($15k 2021 USD) between the least and most expensive areas. Cities that produce greater numbers of tenure-track faculty relative to students such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco are among the most impacted by this pay disparity. The postdoc pay gap is growing and is well-positioned to incur a greater financial burden on economically disadvantaged groups and contribute to faculty hiring disparities in women and racial minorities.

Into the light: Diffusing ccontroversy and increasing transparency in the faculty salary equity study process,"Marchetti, Carol Elizabeth; Bailey, Margaret B.","Women are underrepresented in most science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines within academe and the workforce. In response, the National Science Foundation launched the ADVANCE grant program in the early 2000's to fund efforts which increase the representation of women STEM faculty and academic leaders. Many of the grants funded to date support large-scale comprehensive institutional transformation (IT) projects. In 2012, a large private technical university received an NSF ADVANCE IT grant and set out to strategically launch several initiatives aimed at increasing the representation and advancement of women STEM faculty by removing barriers to resources that support career success and by creating new interventions and resources (NSF ADVANCE 1209115). This paper reports on one of the initiatives within the overall institutional transformation plan which focuses on a salary gender equity study for pre-tenured and tenured faculty, conducted in a manner in which stakeholders would ideally have a high-level of confidence in its results. A cross-university Resource Allocation Committee (RAC) was created, comprised of administrators and faculty with expertise in statistical analysis, faculty hiring and evaluation processes, institutional data, and gender equity considerations. By providing an inclusive framework for faculty and administrators in the form of a collaborative committee, the grant team aims to increase transparency in the salary equity study process and promote internal dissemination of the methodology used and results observed. This approach has the potential to positively impact faculty perceptions of distributive justice as well as those of procedural justice. Formation of such a committee is critical to its success: all stakeholders are represented, the group is sized and comprised to minimize risk and maximize transparency, and leaders promote discussion and consensus. This paper demonstrates how the committee framework was able to bridge differences in perspective, address concerns, and serve as a model for sensitive work within the university.

Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers,"Geiger, R. Stuart; OSullivan, Flynn; Wang, Elsie; Lo, Jonathan","We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee’s gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus their employer. Empirically, we find many reasons why ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The most substantial gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We also tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across different cases and model versions. We also make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness and trustworthyness literature. Our salary negotiation advice scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for not only for the specific model versions we tested, but also around the consistency and robustness of the ChatGPT web platform as a multi-model platform in continuous development.

"Gender, Race, and Economic Status along the Computing Education Pipeline: Examining Disparities in Course Enrollment and Wage Earnings","Warner, J.R.; Baker, S.N.; Haynes, M.; Jacobson, M.; Bibriescas, N.; Yang, Y.","Background and Context: Inequities in computing education have been identified based on gender, race, ethnicity, and economic status. However, extant quantitative research tends to treat demographics as siloed categories instead of accounting for the fact that many students are members of multiple minoritized groups. There is also a conspicuous lack of research that examines equity issues at multiple stages of the education pipeline. Objectives: Our research questions asked: 1) How are gender, race/ethnicity, and economic status related to the likelihood that students will enroll in computing courses in high school? 2) How are these factors related to the likelihood of enrollment in college computing courses? 3) How do these factors relate to wage earnings for students who majored in computer science in college? Method: This study analyzed education and workforce data in the United States using multilevel logistic and linear regression analyses to identify disparities among students from multiple minoritized groups at three stages of life: high school (N=135,961), college (N=199,230), and career (N=1,251). Findings: Compounding course enrollment disparities were present at the high school level for students who are Black or Hispanic/Latino/a and female, economically disadvantaged, or both. Similar results were observed at the college level. Only gender was a statistically significant predictor of wage earnings five years after college graduation, but results of this analysis may be attenuated by the fact that relatively few students who were members of multiple minoritized groups graduated with a computing degree. Implications: These findings demonstrate the importance of considering students' intersecting identities when assessing equity in computing education. They also lay groundwork for understanding how early inequities persist across the education pipeline and how understanding disparities at one stage can inform interpretation of disparities at subsequent stages.",2022,/,,,,61-72,,10.1145/3501385.3543968,,#957,Warner 2022,"",""
"Gendered dimensions of educational premium disadvantage in earnings in USA, 2019","Sharma, Madhuri","The relationships between gender-based earnings disparity and gendered dimensions of human capital gains and labor market changes are quite complex. Some scholars have argued that gender bias improves the over economy of a country/society. Others, however, have argued otherwise, adding to the narrative that despite an overall positive role of educational/human capital gains by women, the benefits reaped by them is non-linear, often with declining premiums for educational progress. This research investigates gendered earnings disadvantage and (dis)parity across US counties by employing GIS-based maps, descriptive statistics, correlations and regression analyses wherein female earnings and female-versus-male earnings ratios are regressed against select explanatory variables representing educational attainments, gender-based work-status, and their occupational over/under-representation in the labor market. Five-years estimates data (2015–2019) from the NHGIS are used for computing location quotients for major occupation-types by gender and additional statistical analyses. Females with professional, Master’s and doctoral degrees have improved earnings, even though gender parity is better for both genders among the less educated. Sadly, gender disparity in earnings is higher when male-versus-female ratio increases for those majoring in science/engineering, science and engineering-related and business degrees. Greater gender parity, however, is noted when more men major in Education—a sub-field largely deemed as feminine. This research calls for focused policy interventions toward encouraging more women in STEM and science/engineering disciplines, along with strategic programs to help attract more women into working full-time—one of the several ways toward bridging the earnings gap. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2022,,GeoJournal,87,,847-868,,10.1007/s10708-022-10623-6,,#959,Sharma 2022,"",""

Cities that produce greater numbers of tenure-track faculty relative to students such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco are among the most impacted by this pay disparity.

"The role of heterogeneous risk preferences, discount rates, and earnings expectations in college major choice","Patnaik, A.; Venator, J.; Wiswall, M.; Zafar, B.","We estimate a rich model of college major choice using a panel of experimentally-derived data. Our estimation strategy combines two types of data: data on self-reported beliefs about future earnings from potential human capital decisions and survey-based measures of risk and time preferences. We show how to use these data to identify a general life-cycle model, allowing for rich patterns of heterogeneous beliefs and preferences. Our data allow us to separate perceptions about the degree of risk or about the current versus future payoffs for a choice from the individual's preference for risk and patience. Comparing our estimates of the general model to estimates of models which ignore heterogeneity in risk and time preferences, we find that these restricted models overstate the importance of earnings to major choice. Additionally, we show that while men are less risk averse and patient than women, gender differences in expectations about own-earnings, risk aversion, and patience cannot explain gender gaps in major choice.

Investigating Commuting Patterns of University Students in a High-Income Developing Country,"Shaaban, K.","This study explores the commuting dynamics of students at Qatar University (QU), focusing on transportation modes, demographics, and frequency of visits. The analysis reveals a predominant use of private cars, with 67% of students driving alone to campus, emphasizing the significance of individual mobility. The survey further delineates gender-based variations, particularly in the context of students commuting with chauffeurs, where 94% are female. Cultural factors play a crucial role, evident in the higher representation of Qatari nationals among students utilizing chauffeurs. While a small percentage utilizes university-provided bus services, the majority leans towards individual driving, reflecting a potential area for improvement in public transit accessibility. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding the effect of cultural, demographic, and infrastructural factors influencing students' commuting choices at QU. The implications of these insights extend to identifying policy initiatives aimed at more efficient transportation options for the university community.",2024,/,,,,347-51,,10.1109/IETC61393.2024.10564413,,#967,Shaaban 2024,"",""
Gender Differences in Wage Expectations,"Fernandes, Ana; Huber, Martin; Vaccaro, Giannina","Using a survey on wage expectations among students at two Swiss institutions of higher education, we examine the wage expectations of our respondents along two main lines. First, we investigate the rationality of wage expectations by comparing average expected wages from our sample with those of similar graduates; we further examine how our respondents revise their expectations when provided information about actual wages. Second, using causal mediation analysis, we test whether the consideration of a rich set of personal and professional controls, namely concerning family formation and children in addition to professional preferences, accounts for the difference in wage expectations across genders. We find that males and females overestimate their wages compared to actual ones, and that males respond in an overconfident manner to information about outside wages. Despite the attenuation of the gender difference in wage expectations brought about by the comprehensive set of controls, gender generally retains a significant direct, unexplained effect on wage expectations.

Trajectories of Advanced Math Taking for Low-Income Students of Color in Middle and High School,"Ricciardi, Courtney","Differential access to and enrollment in advanced mathematics for historically underrepresented groups is a pervasive problem in education. Access to advanced coursework is associated with positive postsecondary outcomes including college acceptance, retention, graduation and more. However, current research examining this problem primarily focuses on achievement in this domain rather than access. This necessitates an examination of who is accessing advanced coursework and what differentiates the course trajectories students follow across middle and high school. This dissertation sought to explore what pathways students were following in advanced math coursework across middle and high school and how demographics, school readiness, and prior academic achievement related to pathways followed. These questions were answered using a large-scale (N = 18,841), majority Latinx (57.6% Latinx, 35.5% Black, 6.1% White/Other, and.6% Asian/Pacific Islander) and low-income sample (77.3% on free or reduced-price lunch in 6th grade) from the Miami School Readiness Project. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to categorize students into 6 classes, which in this study represented the commonly followed pathways of advanced math taking. The 6 class pathways which emerged were Always Standard (standard math in middle and high school), Early Advanced Tryer (advanced in middle school, standard in high school), Late Honors Tryer (standard in middle school, honors in high school), Consistently Mid-level Advanced (advanced in middle school, honors in high school), Primarily Advanced with some College Level (advanced in middle school, standard with some college level in high school), and Most/Earliest Advanced (honors in middle school, standard and some college level in high school). Following this, multinomial logistic regression was used to connect individual demographics, school readiness skills, and prior academic achievement to the likelihood of being assigned to a particular class trajectory. Results revealed that prior academic performance was most strongly related to advanced math pathway assignment, but even when controlling for this variance, gender, special education status, and cognitive and fine motor skills at age 4 also impacted what math pathway a student was likely to follow in middle and high school. Race/ethnicity was a significant differentiator when comparing the two most advanced pathways. These findings highlight the importance of early school readiness skills and demonstrate how early opportunity gaps impact later student outcomes. Furthermore, this project illustrates how tailored intervention and supports are necessary to ensure equitable access to coursework and programming which expands a student’s opportunities and chances for postsecondary success.

The gender wage gap and the early-career effect: the role of actual experience and education level,"Stokke, H.E.","This paper studies how the gender wage gap develops with work experience throughout the career. The contribution is twofold. First, the analysis applies matched employer-employee register data with information on actual, rather than potential, experience. Second, the career effect of the gender wage gap is allowed to differ by workers' education level. The male wage premium is small upon entry to the labor market, whereas it increases rapidly throughout the early career, before stabilizing. In contrast to the existing literature, the estimates reveal heterogeneity among high-educated workers, where the widening of the wage gap is much smaller for postgraduates than other college graduates.

Research on the Relationship Between Years of Education and Urban and Rural Wage Levels Based on Mincer's Wage Equation: Evidence from China,"Jiang, H.; Mou, H.; Zhang, Y.","In the 21st century, China's education system and academic level have gradually improved, and the general income of citizens has steadily increased. However, there is still an insurmountable barrier in the quality, time, and ability between urban and rural areas, citizens' income has a large gap as a result. This article discusses the main factors affecting the income of urban and rural residents through the Mincer wage equation. Based on the Center for Social Science Survey (ISSS) and the China Family Tracking Survey (CFPS) data, this paper constructs a TSLS model to test whether urban and rural education inequality has an impact on wage levels. The results of the study show that for every additional year of education, the average monthly income increases by 8.46%, indicating that Chinese citizens' years of education have a direct impact on the improvement of their wage performance. In addition, health status, marital status and gender also play a role in determining the wage level of Chinese citizens.

Income Inequality in Patients (Pts) with Locally Advanced (LA) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Receiving Proton BeamTherapy,"Konski, X.A.A.; Iocolano, M.; Yegya-Raman, N.; Cohen, R.; Langer, C.; Friedes, C.; Cengel, K.A.; Levin, W.P.; Lariviere, M.J.; Bradley, J.D.; Feigenberg, S.J.","Purpose/Objective(s)Proton beam therapy (PBT) use is limited by availability of PBT units and reimbursement. Health inequity in the use of PBT can exist based upon insurance coverage and access to PBT units. The concentration index (CI) is one measure used to quantify health inequity. CI use in identifying health inequity as it pertains to PBT use has not been documented to date. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with PBT versus conventional radiotherapy (CRT) receipt and perform a health equity analysis in patients with LA-NSCLC.Materials/MethodsPts with LA-NSCLC treated between January 2011 and December 2021 at an academic medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Primary endpoint was treatment with PBT. Secondary endpoint was whether a health inequity existed according to the CI. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine any association between use of PBT and various sociodemographic variables including age, race, gender, median household income, and insurance type (Medicare vs other). Differences between continuous variables were investigated via a two-sided t-test and categorical variables via chi-square test. The Wagstaff correction of the CI was used to determine health inequity. The R statistical package was used for all statistical analyses (https://www.R-project.org/).ResultsOf a total of 594 pts, 293 received PBT and 301 received CRT. Pts treated with PBT were older, 69.7 vs 64, p<0.001, had higher median household income, $84,254 vs $74,310, p<0.001, were more likely to be White, p<0.001, live further away from the center, p = 0.023 and had Medicare insurance, p<0.001. Univariate analysis found age, race, income, distance, and insurance type to predict significantly for PBT use. On multivariate analysis, only Medicare, (p<0.001) predicting for PBT use. The CI was 0.178 (95% CI: 0.086-.27). A positive Concentration Index indicates a higher proportion of use of PBT among financially better off pts.ConclusionThis is the first analysis to show that pts with Medicare insurance were more likely to receive PBT for LA-NSCLC. This result is unsurprising, as most commercial insurance plans do not regularly reimburse the use of PBT. A positive CI indicates a disproportionate concentration of PBT use among the financially better off. Although distance to the proton beam center was longer in pts receiving PBT, there was no correlation between distance and income. Lower income pts may not have the resources to research and seek PBT. These results need confirmation in a larger dataset with a more diverse pt population. Further interventions are needed to lessen inequity and provide access to unique technologies to everyone.

Height conditions salary expectations: Evidence from large-scale data in China,"Yang, Xiao; Gao, Jian; Liu, Jin-Hu; Zhou, Tao","Height premium has been revealed by extensive literature, however, evidence from China based on large-scale data remains still lacking. In this paper, we study how height conditions salary expectations by exploring a dataset covering over 140,000 Chinese job seekers. By using graphical and regression models, we find evidence in support of height premium that tall people expect a significantly higher salary in career development. In particular, regression results suggest stronger effects of height premium on female than on male, however, the gender differences decrease as the education level increases and become insignificant after holding all control variables fixed. Further, results from graphical models suggest three promising ways in helping short people: (i) to accumulate more working experiences, since one year seniority can respectively make up about 3 cm and 7 cm shortness for female and male; (ii) to increase the level of education, since one higher academic degree may eliminate all disadvantages that brought by shortness; (iii) to target jobs in regions with a higher level of development.

Confucian culture and executive compensation: Evidence from China,"Jin, Z.; Li, Y.; Liang, S.","Research Question/IssueThis study investigates how traditional Confucian culture affects executive compensation from three dimensions: CEO compensation level, CEO pay gap (the pay gap between CEO and other management members), and the gender pay gap.Research Findings/InsightsWe find that firms' exposure to stronger Confucianism is associated with less CEO compensation, a smaller CEO pay gap, and a larger gender pay gap in China. These findings are consistent with the core values of moderatism, collectivism, and patriarchalism rooted in the Confucian culture. Our findings are robust to different firms' exposure to Confucian culture measures. Endogeneity concerns are further addressed with a subsample of firms that experienced headquarters relocation. Cross-sectional analyses show that the influence of traditional Confucian culture is more pronounced for firms facing less industry competition, owned by the state, or with a higher concentration of power. Additional analyses show that the Confucian culture also reduces the CEO's pay-for-performance sensitivity, weakens pay incentives, and leads to lower firm risk-taking; however, it also mitigates firm agency problems by reducing firm earnings management and managerial perk consumption. The combination of these positive and negative effects reduces the firm's overall value.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsThis study expands our understanding of the role of informal institutions in corporate behavior. Corporate governance is embedded in the market's formal institutions, which, in turn, are embedded in local informal institutions. Academically, our study suggests further corporate governance research on informal institutions, especially in emerging markets where institutional development is not yet complete and informal institutions play a particularly important role.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis study could help practitioners better understand the business culture and compensation contract design in Confucian nations. It also suggests that policymakers consider the effect of informal institutions when designing formal institutions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2023,/,Corporate Governance: An International Review,,,33-54,,10.1111/corg.12434,,#979,Jin 2023,"",""
"Paying Attention to What Matters: Individual Differences in Neural Correlates of Spatial Selective Attention in Heterogeneous Populations and Increasing Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Justice in STEM","Kwasa, Jasmine A. C.","In life, we try to pay attention to what is important, whether it’s effortfully listening in a noisy environment or simply taking the time to care for another person. In this dissertation, I explore both the neuroscience of spatial selective attention and briefly highlight issues of social justice in STEM fields. Selective attention is used in complex sensory environments where, in order to hear or see an object of focus, one must effortfully attend to it and willfully ignore any sudden or ongoing distractions. Individual variability in performance on selective attention tasks can be large and often correlates with how strongly attention modulates neural responses. These processes rely upon both intact sensory systems and higher order cognitive systems (such as executive functioning) which tend to vary in the general population. In this dissertation, I seek to characterize inherent individual differences in selective attention and explore its neural basis using electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral tasks.First, I compare performance during auditory and visual tasks that require subjects to sustain spatial selective attention. Despite matching the task characteristics, we find that differences in the noise characteristics of auditory and visually evoked neural responses have important consequences on measurement reliability and thus the appropriate neural metric to extract for each modality. In the end, spatial attention, in both modalities, changes neural responses, and these changes significantly predict performance on the task.Next, I compare neurotypical and ADHD adults on a spatial listening task to explore the role of global cognitive deficits on selective attention. Subjects are cued to either only focus on a target voice amidst distractor voices or be prepared to switch attention quickly to an interrupting voice. We observe that neural responses to the interrupting voice is attentionally modulated by neurotypical but not ADHD subjects. And, as in the first experiment, the changes in these neural responses predict performance on the task.Finally, I talk about a different kind of attention: the care, protection, and promotion of underrepresented thinkers in STEM. I highlight three types of engagement that I believe will make the scientific enterprise a more diverse, inclusive, equitable, and just space. I explain barriers to access and exposure holding back students of color in STEM, particularly Black and low-income students and women. Then, I highlight retention and inclusion strategies at the university level that help maintain mental health and community bonds.

"Engagement patterns across race, gender and family income in engineering classrooms","Wilson, Denise; Summers, Lauren; Wright, Joanna","This IUSE-funded study investigated differences in behavioral and emotional engagement that emerge across family income, gender, and race in engineering classrooms. Engagement levels and engagement patterns were measured across seven sophomore- and junior-level engineering courses at a large public university. Differences in engagement were evaluated quantitatively between the two numerical majority races in this study (Asian, white), between genders, between international and domestic students, and across three levels of family income. Sample sizes for other racial groups (black, Pacific Islander, Native American, Hispanic, and Other) were too small to support analyses by family income and were not included in this study. Initial analyses of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in at least one form of engagement between Asian and white students, between men and women, between domestic and international students, and across family income levels. As a result, all four demographic variables (race, gender, country of origin, family income) were retained in a subsequent linear regression to understand potential interactions among these demographic variables. Since these models were weak, the analysis then looked at engagement patterns rather than engagement levels. In this next phase of analysis, scores for the five engagement variables were classified using a non-parametric k-means clustering approach. The data optimally separated into two main categories: less engaged students (Cluster 1) and more engaged students (Cluster 2). Among domestic students, 100% of low income Asian women and 82% of low income Asian men (82%) fell into the more engaged cluster, while high-income Asian women (83%) fell into the less engaged cluster. Among international students (who were entirely Asian in this sample), low income Asian men and high income Asian women were among those who had the highest percentage of lesser engaged students (40% of each group, respectively) while middle income Asian men and middle income Asian women had the highest percentage of more engaged students (approximately 80% of each). Overall, the k-means clustering approach provided greater insight into the data than traditional statistical analysis techniques. Differences and trends among all four demographic variables (gender, family income, race, country of origin) emerged, showing that students from some demographic groups seem more susceptible to remaining less engaged in courses than other groups. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",2019,,,,,,,,,#981,Wilson 2019,"",""
Getting what (employers think) you’re worth: evidence on the gender gap in entry wages among university graduates,"Bredtmann, J.; Otten, S.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the gender wage differential of labor market entrants and the determinants of their starting wages. Design/methodology/approach – The paper makes use of a unique data set on graduates in economics from a large German university that contains detailed information on the graduates’ course of study, their additional qualifications and their transition from university to the labor market. Based on these data, Mincer-type earnings functions as well as wage decompositions as proposed by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) are performed. Findings – The paper finds a significant gender wage differential of 7 percent. Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions suggest that the major part of this gap remains unexplained by gender differences in observable characteristics.

Originality/value – This paper investigates the determinants of entry wages for a homogeneous group of high-skilled workers using a unique data set of graduates in business and economics from a large German university. Concentrating on a highly homogeneous sample limits the problem of unobserved heterogeneity, which results in an overestimation of the unexplained component of standard decompositions analyses.

Essays in Economics of Education: Teacher Labour Markets and Earnings of University Graduates,"Handler, Tomasz M.","This thesis consists of three substantive chapters, which explore topics related to the economics of education. Two of the chapters examine teacher labour markets, and one chapter examines the earnings of university graduates.In Chapter 2, I create a new and unique dataset to examine how teacher characteristics affect the probability of acquiring a permanent teaching position in the Ontario public school system. This chapter provides evidence of how difficult it was for recent Ontario teachers’ college graduates to obtain a teaching job. The odds of finding a position in 2006 were, on average, around four times higher than they were in 2013. Moreover, qualified French-language teachers were, on average, three to five times more likely to find a job than teachers without French-language qualifications.In Chapter 3, I take advantage of restricted-access data to examine what is more important for earnings — the university that a student attends or the program that he or she pursues. In particular, this chapter uses a method called relative-importance analysis, which partitions the variation in earnings into program and school components and thus allows me to determine the degree to which they affect earnings. The results show that there is more variation in earnings across programs than schools. Programs account for between two and eleven times the amount of variation in earnings than schools, depending on gender, degree type and period since graduation.In Chapter 4, I estimate the outside-option salaries of recent Ontario teachers’ college graduates from the 2007 to 2013 graduating cohorts and compare them to teaching salaries from the same cohorts. To do this, I create a new teacher salary dataset and combine it with the data from the first two chapters. The results show that median teaching salaries did not vary to any great extent across genders, cohorts and time periods since graduation. However, the median outside-option salaries varied substantially across those same factors. Moreover, the median teaching salaries were greater than outside-option salaries across all factors. Also, despite there not being any gender differences in teaching salaries, the outside-option median salaries were substantially greater for males than females.

"Removing a Barrier: Analysis of the Impact of Removing Calculus and Physics from CS on Employability, Salary, and Broadening Participation","Ross, M.; Weiss, M.A.; Minaya, L.; Laginess, A.; Patel, D.; Fisher, K.Q.","This study was designed to compare salary implications and employability of students who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (BACS) - primarily distinguished by the removal of calculus and physics requirements from the traditional computer science curriculum versus those that graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). Given the numerous studies that identify gateway courses like calculus and physics as impediments to students' persistence in engineering and computer science AND their impact on women and people of color, the removal of this barrier has incredible potential for broadening participation in computing. One university's first cohort of BACS graduates (spring 2020) furnished a unique opportunity to compare student's self-reported employment and salary information to their BSCS peers. The study consisted of institutional data and a survey targeting spring 2020, summer 2020, fall 2020 graduates from computer science, with data fromn =134 recent graduates (BAn = 45, BSn =89). Preliminary results indicate there are no statistical significance in enrollment on the basis of gender nor job attainment; however, there is a statistical significance in enrollment on the basis of race/ethnicity and pay. The results of this work could either serve as a cautionary tale for institutions considering similar programs OR it could serve as the basis for a deeper, more critical review of the requirements currently in place in BSCS programs, nationally.

Defining first-generation and low-income students in engineering: An exploration,"Atwood, Sara A.; Gilmartin, Shannon Katherine; Harris, Angela; Sheppard, Sheri","First-generation (FG) and/or low-income (LI) engineering student populations are of particular interest in engineering education. However, these populations are not defined in a consistent manner across the literature or amongst stakeholders. The intersectional identities of these groups have also not been fully explored in most quantitative-based engineering education research. This research paper aims to answer the following three research questions: (RQ1) How do students' demographic characteristics and college experiences differ depending on levels of parent educational attainment (which forms the basis of first-generation definitions) and family income? (RQ2) How do 'first-generation' and 'low-income' definitions impact results comparing to their continuing-generation and higher-income peers? (RQ3) How does considering first-generation and low-income identities through an intersectional lens deepen insight into the experiences of first-generation and low-income groups? Data were drawn from a nationally representative survey of engineering juniors and seniors (n = 6197 from 27 U.S. institutions). Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate respondent differences in demographics (underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM), women, URM women), college experiences (internships/co-ops, having a job, conducting research, and study abroad), and engineering task self-efficacy (ETSE), based on various definitions of 'first generation' and 'low income' depending on levels of parental educational attainment and self-reported family income. Our results indicate that categorizing a first-generation student as someone whose parents have less than an associate's degree versus less than a bachelor's degree may lead to different understandings of their experiences (RQ1). For example, the proportion of URM students is higher among those whose parents have less than an associate's degree than among their associate's degree or more peers (26% vs 11.9%). However, differences in college experiences are most pronounced among students whose parents have less than a bachelor's degree compared with their bachelor's degree or more peers: having a job to help pay for college (55.4% vs 47.3%), research with faculty (22.7% vs 35.0%), and study abroad (9.0% vs 17.3%). With respect to differences by income levels, respondents are statistically different across income groups, with fewer URM students as family income level increases. As family income level increases, there are more women in aggregate, but fewer URM women. College experiences are different for the middle income or higher group (internship 48.4% low and lower-middle income vs 59.0% middle income or higher; study abroad 11.2% vs 16.4%; job 58.6% vs 46.8%). Despite these differences in demographic characteristics and college experiences depending on parental educational attainment and family income, our dataset indicates that the definition does not change the statistical significance when comparing between first-generation students and students who were continuing-generation by any definition (RQ2). First-generation and low-income statuses are often used as proxies for one another, and in this dataset, are highly correlated. However, there are unique patterns at the intersection of these two identities. For the purpose of our RQ3 analysis, we define 'first-generation' as students whose parents earned less than a bachelor's degree and 'low-income' as low or lower-middle income. In this sample, 68 percent of students were neither FG nor LI while 11 percent were both (FG&LI). On no measure of demographics or college experience is the FG&LI group statistically similar to the advantaged group. Low-income students had the highest participation in working to pay for college, regardless of parental education, while first-generation students had the lower internship participation than low-income students. Furthermore, being FG&LI is associated with lower ETSE compared with all other groups. These results suggest that care is required when applying the labels first-generation and/or low-income when considering these groups in developing institutional support programs, in engineering education research, and in educational policy. Moreover, by considering first-generation and low-income students with an intersectional lens, we gain deeper insight into engineering student populations that may reveal potential opportunities and barriers to educational resources and experiences that are an important part of preparation for an engineering career. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",2020,,,2020-June,,Abet; Engineering Unleashed; et al.; Gradescope; IEEE Xplore; Keysight Technologies,,,,#995,Atwood 2020,"",""
"Using community-based, ethnographic methods to examine risk perceptions and actions of low-income, first-time mothers in a post-spill environment","Mundorf, Christopher A.; Lichtveld, Maureen Y.","Following the 2010 Gulf Oil Spill, area pregnant women were thought to be at-risk for poor health outcomes from the stress of managing health actions in this post-disaster environment. Research directed by an ongoing community–academic partnership sought to explore the specific role of culture in environmental risk protection actions among low-income pregnant women. As a part of the first-phase of a mixed-methods cultural study, community health workers (CHWs) used freelisting methods to survey low-income, first-time mother (n = 20) for the threats in the environment and relevant protective actions. Then, a separate pile sort activity (n = 31) was used to further investigate these cultural topics. Results elicited a diverse range of threats, protective actions, and sources of support across socio-demographic groups. Results also showed a culturally tailored conceptualization of threats in the environment. Exploring beliefs among a diverse population helps to uncover cultural differences in a population. Results will aid in developing culturally tailored policies and interventions, and increase the relevance of such interventions to address community concerns. Moreover, incorporating CHWs into the research process enhanced researcher literacy, and fostered mutual trust between the community and researchers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,,Journal of Risk Research,21,3,308-322,,10.1080/13669877.2016.1200656,,#996,Mundorf 2018,"",""
Does forced or compensated turnout lead to musculoskeletal injuries in dancers? A systematic review on the complexity of causes,"Kaufmann, Judith-Elisa; Nelissen, Rob G.H.H.; Exner-Grave, Elisabeth; Gademan, Maaike G.J.","Injury prevalence in dancers is high, and misaligned turnout (TO) is claimed to bear injury risk. This systematic review aimed to investigate if compensating or forcing TO leads to musculoskeletal injuries. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA Guidelines using the databases of PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Academic Search Premier, and ScienceDirect. Studies investigating the relationship between compensated or forced TO and injuries in all genders, all ages, and levels of dancers were included. Details on misaligned TO measurements and injuries had to be provided. Screening was performed by two researchers, data extraction and methodological quality assessment executed by one researcher and checked by another. 7 studies with 1293 dancers were included. Methodological quality was low due to study designs and a general lack of standardised definition of pathology and methods of assessment of misaligned TO. The studies investigating the lower extremities showed a hip-focus only. Non-hip contributors as well as their natural anatomical variations were not accounted for, limiting the understanding of injury mechanisms underlying misaligned TO. As such no definite conclusions on the effect of compensating or forcing TO on musculoskeletal injuries could be made. Total TO is dependent on complex motion cycles rather than generalised (hip) joint dominance only. Objective dual assessment of maximum passive joint range of motion through 3D kinematic analysis in combination with physical examination is needed to account for anatomical variations, locate sites prone to (overuse)injury, and investigate underlying injury mechanisms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Journal of Biomechanics,114,,,,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.110084,,#997,Kaufmann 2021,"",""
Digital Technologies For Development: The Role of Social and Cultural Structures in Influencing Experiences of Low-income Communities With Internet Kiosks in Uganda,"Mohamud, Khadija Amal","This PhD explores the complexities of the establishment and use of Internet Kiosks, a Community Technology Centre (CTC) intervention in two urban low-income communities in Uganda. The past twenty-five years have seen a rapid proliferation of CTCs as a way to bridge the digital divide in low-income communities in Africa. However, research shows that a significant gap between male and female access to ICT still exists where CTCs have been established due to the contextual issues within the social and cultural setting. To understand why this gap still exists, I investigate the complexities within the social and cultural context that influenced the access and utilisation of Internet Kiosks in urban low-income communities in Uganda, encompassing enablers and barriers.Additionally, although many studies have reported on CTCs, the literature has focused on their role in bridging the digital divide and the tangible impacts such as the return on education and financial gain with little focus on intangible influences such as their role in facilitating soft skills development such as leadership skills, collaboration skills, communication skills and social elements. In this study, I present a case study account of the experiences of two urban low-income communities using Internet Kiosks in Uganda and demonstrate their impact on learning and influence on the quality of life.Finally, CTC expansion and their relevance, the Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) literature has indicated these centres cannot continuously operate due to the mismatch between their design and the reality of the context. Thus, in this study, I demonstrate how power imbalance between different stakeholders, gender and age aspects influence sustainability and report on two crucial dimensions to understanding how CTC sustainability could be promoted: stakeholder engagement and technological design.This PhD utilised a sociocultural perspective to understand participants’ lives and a qualitative multiple case study research design was used. The data generated was thematically analysed using an inductive approach.The first key finding related to the access and utilisation of the Kiosks shows that complexities associated with age, gender and social structures within the social and cultural context determined who accessed the Kiosks and how they were accessed.The second key finding related to the impact of the Kiosks shows that the Kiosks created numerous opportunities that afforded users in these urban low-income communities new learning opportunities, better communication, new income possibilities and soft skills development. The data also shows the Kiosks became social spaces that nurtured a sense of belonging within their communities. However, the data also indicates that some limitations were associated with them, in particular the possibility of children being exposed to unsuitable content for their age and young people encountering bullying and harassment at the Kiosks.The third finding related to the sustainability of the Kiosks is that the asymmetrical power relations between different stakeholders influenced stakeholder engagement and technological design, which led to a mismatch between the design and the reality of the context, thereby affecting sustainability. In summary, this thesis illustrates how the specific social and cultural contexts within these two urban low-income communities in Uganda influences CTC access, impact, and sustainability.The findings in this thesis also led to the development of a proposed framework, Context Complexities, a tool to guide CTC design, implementation, and evaluation in low-income communities in Uganda and similar low-income communities in Sub-Saharan Africa.

"How important are different socially responsible marketing practices? An exploratory study of gender, race, and income differences","Patino, A.; Kaltcheva, V.D.; Pitta, D.; Sriram, V.; Winsor, R.D.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the importance consumers place on various types of socially responsible marketing practices, and whether the level of importance varies by gender, race, and consumers' income. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was designed that asked subjects their attitudes toward the various social marketing practices that were uncovered through an analysis of recent literature from ABI-Inform, Fordham University's Center for Positive Marketing and focus groups. The survey was administered to 232 subjects and included information regarding race, gender, and income. Survey results were analyzed using latent class analysis (LCA). The results of the LCA were used to develop a correspondence analysis map. Findings – The results confirm the importance of key demographic factors (income, gender, and race) in understanding consumers' perceptions of socially responsible marketing. Research limitations/implications – One limitation is that the sample was collected in Baltimore, Maryland and not entirely representative of the population of the USA. Another limitation is that consumers’ perceptions of socially responsible marketing are only captured at one point in time rather than showing the evolution of a belief. Practical implications – Marketers need to target their messages carefully if they are promoting socially responsible marketing as a differentiating factor. Understanding how each demographic group responds to these socially responsible marketing messages can assist managers in their promotional efforts. Originality/value – Limited research has been completed that segments the market with regards to socially responsible marketing options.

"Work injuries in internal migrants to Alberta, Canada. Do workers' compensation records provide an unbiased estimate of risk?","Cherry, N.; Galarneau, J.-M.; Haan, M.; Haynes, W.; Lippel, K.","Introduction: It is not known whether out-of-province Canadians, who travel to Alberta for work, are at increased risk of occupational injury. Methods: Workers' compensation board (WCB) claims in 2013 to 2015 for those injured in Alberta were extracted by home province. Denominator data, from Statistics Canada, indicated the numbers from Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) employed in Alberta in 2012. Both datasets were stratified by industry, age, and gender. Logistic regression estimated the risk of a worker from NL making a WCB claim in 2013 or 2014, stratified by time lost from work. Bias from under-reporting was examined in responses to injury questions in a cohort of trades' workers across Canada and in a pilot study in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Results: Injury reporting rate in workers from NL was lower than those from Alberta, with a marked deficit (odds ratio [OR] = 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.27) for injuries resulting in 1 to 30 days off work. Among the 1520 from Alberta in the trades' cohort, 327 participants reported 444 work injuries: 34.5% were reported to the WCB, rising to 69.4% in those treated by a physician. A total of 52 injuries in Alberta were recorded by 151 workers in the Fort McMurray cohort. In logistic regression, very similar factors predicted WCB reporting in the trades and Fort McMurray cohorts, but those from out-of-province or recently settled in Alberta were much less likely to report (OR = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.40). Conclusion: Differential rates of under-reporting explain in part the overall low estimates of injuries in interprovincial workers but not the deficit in time-loss 1 to 30 days.",2019,06/,American Journal of Industrial Medicine,62,6,486-95,,10.1002/ajim.22981,,#1001,Cherry 2019,"",""
Are Minimum Wage Effects Greater in Low-Wage Areas?,"Godoey, A.; Reich, M.","Empirical work on the minimum wage typically estimates effects averaged across high- and low-wage areas. Low-wage labor markets could potentially be less able to absorb minimum wage increases, in turn leading to more negative employment effects. In this article, we examine minimum wage effects in low-wage counties, where relative minimum wage ratios reach as high as 0.82, well beyond the state-based ratios in extant studies. Using data from the American Community Survey, the Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and the Quarterly Census on Employment and Wages, we implement event study and difference-in-differences methods, estimating average causal effects for all events in our sample and separately for areas with lower and higher impacts. We find positive wage effects, especially in high-impact counties, but do not detect adverse effects on employment, weekly hours, or annual weeks worked. We do not find negative employment effects among women, Blacks, and/or Hispanics. In high-impact counties, we find substantial declines in household and child poverty.

Mathematical Modeling of Population Mobility by Income,"Chudinova, O.S.; Renner, A.G.; Yarkova, O.N.","The problem of inequality in the distribution of the population incomes is characterized by complexity and ambiguity. On the one hand, that is a natural and economically justified phenomenon. On the other hand, a strong stratification of society by income can cause socio-economic problems. Therefore, to research inequality it is necessary not only to give an appropriate assessment of the level of the population incomes differentiation, but also to identify the features of this process. The research carried out mathematical modeling of population mobility by income including: creation of a kernel density estimation of the income distribution of an individual; population stratification by income using the EM-algorithm; class characteristics by gender, age and socio-demographic characteristics of individuals; identification of factors that have a significant impact on the population stratification by income; construction of binary choice models for the probability of a decrease and an increase in an indi-vidual's income. As a result of the implementation of the proposed algorithm according to the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring survey, the population was stratified by income and a mathematical model of population mobility was built. The factors influencing the decline in income include: respondent's gender, job loss, employment, obtaining an additional source of income and retirement. Factors, that affect income growth include: marriage status, higher education, job loss, employment and extra source of income. The proposed algorithm can serve as an effective tool for understanding the features of the process of differentiating incomes of the population, especially during periods of crisis and socio-economic reforms. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,,,,,,10.1109/FarEastCon50210.2020.9271507,,#1003,Chudinova 2020,"",""
"Older People, Mobility and Transport in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Review of the Research","Gorman, M.; Jones, S.; Turner, J.","Older populations are rising globally, which in high-income countries has helped to generate a growing literature on the impact of ageing on travel requirements and transport policy. This article aims to provide an initial assessment of the state of knowledge on the impact on transportation policy and usage of the increasing numbers of older people in lowand middle-income countries (LAMICs), through a review of the literature relating to older people and transportation. As both the academic and policy/practice-related literature specifically addressing ageing and transport in LAMICs is limited, the study looks beyond transportation to assess the state of knowledge regarding the ways in which older people’s mobility is affected by issues, such as health, well-being, social (dis)engagement and gender. We find significant knowledge gaps, resulting in an evidence base to support the implementation of policy is lacking. Most research in low-income countries (LICs) is either broad quantitative analysis based on national survey data or small-scale qualitative studies. We conclude that, although study of the differing contexts of ageing in LAMICs as they relate to older people’s mobilities and transport use has barely begun, institutions which both make and influence policymaking recognise the existence of significant knowledge gaps.

Does the Minimum Wage Make Young Adult Labor More Attractive to Firms? A Panel Data Analysis That Controls for Spatial Heterogeneity,"Snarr, H.W.; Romero, A.A.","Adverse effects of minimum wage policy on labor markets materialize only if the new rate is binding. Annual data from the Current Population Survey indicate that the minimum wage is effectively non-binding for young adults (19-29) who have at least one year of college and are not enrolled in school. Hence, a minimum wage hike would have no effect on young adult workers... or does it? The authors investigate this using dynamic panel data that accounts for spatial heterogeneity, which must be controlled for because minimum wage coefficients are biased otherwise (Allegretto, Dube, and Reich 2011). The authors find that accounting for spatial heterogeneity and the inertia that is present in labor market variables affects the results dramatically. Average unemployment in adjacent states has a large net positive cumulative impact on young adult male employment but a large negative cumulative effect on young adult female employment. Though both cohorts are sensitive to market wages and weekly earnings, males are more geographically mobile while female employment is negatively linked to having children, poverty, welfare participation, and urbanity but positively associated with welfare reform. While the minimum wage was insignificant in the young adult male employment model, its anticipatory effect is associated with higher young adult female employment. This is perhaps due to firms substituting teen (16-18) labor with young adult females who possess longer employment tenure, slightly better job skills, and greater personal responsibility.",2014,01/,International Journal of Social Ecology and Sustainable Development,5,1,111-37,,10.4018/ijsesd.2014010108,,#1013,Snarr 2014,"",""

The effect of relative income on happiness in dual-earner households is examined in relation to gender identity. The estimation results from ordered probit model show that an increase in wives’ share of total income decreases only husbands’ happiness, while the happiness of wives is not affected. The estimation results show that wives’ income exceeding husbands’ income does not lead to a decrease in wives’ happiness, while wives, who are almost the breadwinners of the households, negatively affect husbands’ happiness. The introduction of an alternative specification for gender identity confirms that there is no relationship between the income advantage of wives over husbands and their happiness. The estimation results for husbands’ happiness with the alternative specification show that a lower but very similar income contribution of wives, than that of husbands, reduces husbands’ happiness. It is also found that wives who are almost the main earners in dual-earner households reduce husbands’ happiness. All results obtained from the OLS regression are consistent with all findings.

The penalty is lower in companies with a higher share of women on the compensation committee, suggesting that women’s participation plays a role in setting a more equal remuneration policy.

Closing the gender wage gap in the boardroom: the role of compliance with governance codes,"Melón-Izco, Álvaro; Arkaitz Bañuelos Campo","PurposeThis paper aims to analyse the gender wage gap (GWG) in the board of directors at the executive-director level. The authors aim to answer two questions: (1) Is the GWG explained by differences between males and females, by discriminatory causes or by both? and (2) what are the main factors that cause or increase the existence of GWGs? Specifically, the authors pay special attention to compliance with good governance codes as a fundamental variable in explaining the GWG.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses a sample of directors in Spanish companies listed on the continuous market from 2013 to 2021 and uses Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition and unconditional quantile regressions to analyse the GWG.FindingsThe findings demonstrate both discriminatory reasons and differences between individuals when explaining the GWG and showing that compliance with remuneration practices issued by good governance codes considerably reduces the GWG for all remuneration components.Practical implicationsThe study confirms adequacy of regulator remuneration recommendations but highlights GWG persistence within boards. To counter this, enforcing pay transparency aids female directors’ advancement, reducing bonuses’ impact on wage disparity, necessitating monitored laws for fairer compensation systems and meeting 40% of women directors’ proposals.Social implicationsPrimarily, this study significantly influences public attitudes towards GWG. Specifically, it calls for companies to not only increase female leadership representation but also to ensure equitable remuneration aligned with their male counterparts, conduct regular pay equity assessments, implement pay transparency policies and support work-life balance through flexible hours and parental leave.

Dual-Earner Couples’ Gender Role Attitudes and Their Parental Leave Decisions: A Longitudinal Study of Partner Influences,"Stertz, Anna M.; Wiese, Bettina S.","This study examines how men and women in heterosexual partnerships influence each other’s parental leave decisions through their gender role attitudes. We differentiate between attitudes toward women’s parental role, women’s worker role, men’s parental role, and men’s worker role, and consider the role of traditional gender ideology denoting an attitude of negatively evaluating mothers’ employment when children are young. We investigated communal traits as a potential moderator to better understand partner effects, i.e., one partner’s role attitudes affecting the other partner’s leave decision. We analyzed longitudinal data from N = 365 heterosexual, mainly German dual-earner couples, collected between pregnancy and about 18 months after the birth of their first child, using the actor-partner interdependence model. We examined mothers’ and fathers’ attitudes toward all five types of gender roles and found that both mothers and fathers were influenced in their leave decisions by their partners’ attitudes toward early maternal employment. Mothers whose partners were more traditional in this regard took longer leaves; fathers whose partners were more traditional took shorter leaves. Fathers’ leave length was also influenced by their partners’ attitudes toward men’s worker role, with more traditional attitudes resulting in shorter leaves. The latter relationship was moderated by fathers’ communal traits, such that more communal fathers were more strongly influenced by their female partners’ attitudes. Overall, this research extends the understanding of mutual influences and decision-making dynamics in dual-earner couples in the early family phase.",2024,,Sex Roles,90,8,1018-1039,3096460799,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-024-01474-1,,#1017,Stertz 2024,"",""
"Rereading the Wages for Housework Campaign: Feminist Degrowth Reflections on Social Reproduction, Commons, and a Care Income","Dengler, Corinna","This paper explores how debates on wages for housework in the 1970s contribute to current discourses on redefining, redistributing, and revaluing care. More specifically, this paper asks: How does a rereading of the international Wages for Housework (WfH) campaign contribute to feminist degrowth debates on commoning care and a care income? In trying to answer this question, I revisit original literature and interpretations of WfH and show that, as a Marxist feminist political perspective, the aim of the campaign ventured beyond the monetization of care. Subsequently, I elaborate on the now divergent ideas of Selma James and Silvia Federici, two of the campaign's main founders, of how to re-actualize the transformative aim of the campaign. Their two proposals, namely, a care income and reproductive commons, are introduced, brought into conversation with each other, and critically discussed against the background of Nancy Fraser's distinction between affirmative and transformative strategies of transformation. Exploring the fertile tension between a care income and commoning care, I draw preliminary conclusions on what feminist degrowth can learn from WfH regarding a social-ecological transformation to a more socially just and ecologically sound economic system.",2024,,Hypatia,39,3,538-557,3128716099,https://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2024.14,,#1018,Dengler 2024,"",""
Inequality Within the Family: A Comparative Analysis of Gendered Working Time Preferences Among Dual-Earner Couples,"Waismel-Manor, Ronit; Levanon, Asaf","The preference for reduced work hours is well-known to be associated with various social ramifications, but research on the determinants of workers’ preference is generally limited to investigating individual and job characteristics. Building on the paradigm of the social construction of gender, the life-course perspective, and scholarship on welfare policy, we examine the relationships between heterosexual dual-earner couples’ work hour arrangements and men’s and women’s own preferences for reduced work hours, as well as their desire for their spouses’ reduced work hours in 19 countries. This study contributes to the literature on gendered work hour preferences by theorizing and analyzing two gendered family-centered contexts: couples' adaptive strategies and work-family policy regimes as two main theoretical frameworks. Thus, our approach allows examining which couple-level strategies and policies can combat hours’ mismatch, given the gendered structure of work opportunities and gender norms. Second, we offer the first examination of the role that defamilization policies play in shaping preferences for reduced hours at the couple level. Using the 2010 European Social Survey, this study documents a pervasive preference for reduced work hours for men and women in dual-earner couples. Multilevel models indicate that, regardless of dual-earner couples’ work hour arrangements, individuals generally report preferences for working hours for themselves and their spouses that conform to a modified male breadwinner-female homemaker model. Moreover, individuals in dual-earner couples in countries with less developed work-family policies feel more pressed for time.",2024,,Sex Roles,90,7,832-847,3078226269,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-024-01481-2,,#1019,Waismel-Manor 2024,"",""

Gabe; Guttman, Shayna; Rothman, Karen; Le, Yunying; Bucan, Nika R.; Doss, Brian D.","Sexual intimacy, characterized as the experience between individuals of sharing general affection and sexual activity with one another within the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships inventory, is positively related to relationship satisfaction and stability. However, many studies of couple therapy have shown that it only results in small-sized (and often non-significant) improvements in sexual intimacy. Furthermore, there are numerous financial, logistical, and psychological barriers to couple therapy. Thus, the current study sought to examine whether two brief online relationship education programs (OurRelationship and ePREP) could overcome these barriers and yield similar-sized effects to more intensive couple therapy. In two independently collected samples of low-income couples (NSample 1 = 742 Couples; M AgeSample 1 = 33.19; NSample 2 = 671 Couples; M AgeSample 2 = 33.48), the current study found that: OurRelationship (d = 0.24–0.28) and ePREP (d = 0.26–0.34) produced small-sized changes in sexual intimacy relative to a waitlist control condition in both samples, the magnitude of the effect size replicated in a second sample and, with rare exception, these changes were generally not moderated by key variables of interest.

Examining the boundary conditions of tokenism: within-occupation gender wage gaps and female representation in the Canadian labor market,"Stephenson, Amber L; Yerger, David B","PurposeThe purpose of this study was to examine the boundary conditions of Kanter's (1977) tokenism theory as applied to the gender wage gap. The authors aimed to discover if there was a point where the relationship between the percentage of women in a job category and the gender wage gap changed, and, if so, where the threshold was located and what was the nature of the shift in relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used the Andrews’ (1993) threshold effects technique. Using 22 separate years of publicly available Canadian wage data, they examined the relationship between the percentage of females in 40 unique occupational categories and the female-to-male earnings ratio (for a total of 880 observations).FindingsThe results showed the existence of a threshold point, and that early gains in percent female within an occupation, up to approximately 14% female in the occupation, associate with strong gains in the female-to-male wage ratio. However, beyond that point, further gains in percent female associate with smaller improvements in the female-to-male wage ratio.Practical implicationsThe findings are useful in understanding the dynamics of occupational group gender composition, potential theoretical reasons for the nuances in relationship, as well as opportunities that may facilitate more equitable outcomes.Originality/value The results show that, though improvements were made above and below the threshold point, enhancements in the wage gap are actually larger when there are less women in the job category (e.g. tokens).",2024,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",43,4,711-727,3048277792,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-05-2023-0140,,#1021,Stephenson 2024,"",""

Maternal exposure to any IPV increased the odds of stunting, but only physical and sexual IPV were independently associated with an increased risk of stunting. Three different types of IPV exhibited a cumulative effect on stunting. Maternal exposure to physical IPV was significantly associated with an increased risk of wasting. Significant associations between maternal exposure to emotional IPV with offspring stunting and physical IPV with wasting were only observed in children aged 0 to 36 months.

Key barriers to the provision and utilization of maternal health services in low-and lower-middle-income countries; a scoping review,"Sarikhani, Yaser; Seyede Maryam Najibi; Razavi, Zahra","BackgroundThe preservation and promotion of maternal health (MH) emerge as vital global health objectives. Despite the considerable emphasis on MH, there are still serious challenges to equitable access to MH services in many countries. This review aimed to determine key barriers to the provision and utilization of MH services in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs).MethodsIn this scoping review, we comprehensively searched four online databases from January 2000 to September 2022. In this study, the approach proposed by Arksey and O’Malley was used to perform the review. Consequently, 117 studies were selected for final analysis. To determine eligibility, three criteria of scoping reviews (population, concept, and context) were assessed alongside the fulfillment of the STROBE and CASP checklist criteria. To synthesize and analyze the extracted data we used the qualitative content analysis method.ResultsThe main challenges in the utilization of MH services in LLMICs are explained under four main themes including, knowledge barriers, barriers related to beliefs, attitudes and preferences, access barriers, and barriers related to family structure and power. Furthermore, the main barriers to the provision of MH services in these countries have been categorized into three main themes including, resource, equipment, and capital constraints, human resource barriers, and process defects in the provision of services.ConclusionsThe evidence from this study suggests that many of the barriers to the provision and utilization of MH services in LLMICs are interrelated. Therefore, in the first step, it is necessary to prioritize these factors by determining their relative importance according to the specific conditions of each country. Consequently, comprehensive policies should be developed using system modeling approaches.",2024,,BMC Women's Health,24,,1-15,3066893852,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03177-x,,#1025,Sarikhani 2024,"",""

We used the conservation of resource theory and family systems theory as guiding frameworks. Couples were from a nationally representative sample of married couples recruited using a two-stage cluster stratification strategy. Using a random-intercept, actor-partner interdependence, cross-lagged panel model, we found bidirectional, longitudinal associations among changes in work-family conflicts and perceived fairness of housework division across the transition caused by COVID-19. Specifically, increased work-family conflicts predicted the perception of increased unfairness in housework division and vice versa, and changes experienced by husbands were predictive for both spouses. We also found husbands’ (not wives’) more traditional gender attitudes exaggerated the associations between increased work-family conflicts and the perception of more unfairness.

Investigating the gender pay gap in the Maltese financial and insurance sector: a macro and micro approach,"Farrugia, Maria; Borg, Anna; Thake, Anne Marie","PurposeAlthough women have advanced in the economic sphere, the gender pay gap (GPG) remains a persisting problem for gender equality. Using Acker's theory of gendered organisations, this study strives to gain a better understanding from a macro and micro approach, how family and work-related policies, especially family-friendly measures (FFMs), and their uptake, contribute and maintain the GPG in Malta and specifically within the Financial and Insurance sector.Design/methodology/approachTwo research instruments were used. National policy documents were analysed through the gender lens, followed by structured interviews with HR managerial participants within this sector.FindingsFindings suggest that at a macro level, family and work-related policies could be divided into two broad categories: A set of family-friendly policies that contribute to the GPG because of their gendered nature, or because the uptake is mostly taken by women. These include make-work pay policies, which initially appear to be gender neutral, but which attracted lower educated inactive women to the Maltese labour market at low pay, contributing to an increase in the GPG. Second, a set of policies that take on a gender-neutral approach and help reduce the GPG. These include policies like the free childcare and after school care scheme that allow mothers to have a better adherence to the labour market. At the micro level within organisations, pay discrepancies between women and men were largely negated and awareness about the issue was low. Here, “ideal worker” values based on masculine norms seemed to lead to covert biases towards mothers who shoulder heavier care responsibilities in the families and make a bigger use of FFMs. Because men are better able to conform to these gendered values and norms, the GPG persists through vertical segregation and glass ceilings, among others.Research limitations/implicationsSince not all the companies in the Eurostat NACE code list participated in this research, results could not be generalised but were indicative to future large-scale studies..Practical implicationsAt the macro and policy level, some FFMs take on a clear gendered approach. For example, the disparity in length between maternity (18 weeks) and paternity leave (1 day) reinforces gender roles and stereotypes, which contribute to the GPG in the long run. While some FFMs like parental leave, career breaks, urgent family leave, telework, flexible and reduced hours seem to take on a more gender-neutral approach, the uptake of FFMs (except childcare) seems to generate discriminatory behaviour that may affect the GPG. When considering the make-work pay policies such as the “in-work benefit” and the “tapering of benefits”, this study showed that these policies attracted lower educated and low-skilled women into the labour market, which in turn may have further contributed to the increasing GPGs. On the other hand, the childcare and after school policies relieve working mothers from caregiving duties, minimising career interruptions, discriminatory behaviour and overall GPGs.Social implicationsThis study confirmed that organisations within the Financial and Insurance sector are gendered and give value to full-time commitment and long working hours, especially in managerial roles. Managerial positions remain associated with men because mothers tend to make more use of FFMs such as parental leave, reduced, flexible hours and teleworking. Mothers are indirectly penalised for doing so, because in gendered organisations, the uptake of FFMs conflict with the demands of work and ideal worker values (Acker, 1990). This maintains the vertical segregation and widens the GPG within the Financial and Insurance sector.Originality/valueBy using the gender lens and taking a wider and more holistic approach from the macro and micro level, this study highlights how interlinking factors lead to and sustain the GPG in the Financial and Insurance sector in Malta.",2024,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",43,1,93-113,2913261832,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-02-2022-0038,,#1029,Farrugia 2024,"",""

In addition, actors' human capital endowments and past performance can be measured precisely. The factors that impact the salaries of movie stars are likely to influence the pay of other high-wage employees, such as athletes and executives.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses a rich panel data set including 178 female and male actors in 973 movies released between 1980 and 2019. Using a random-effects model and the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition approach, this paper distinguishes between a fraction of the gender pay gap that can be explained and another fraction that cannot be explained. Hence, only the unexplained residual typically obtained by estimating two standard Mincer-type earnings functions is due to discriminatory pay practices.FindingsThis study reveals a pay difference between female and male actors. Gender-specific representation in leading roles and systematic differences in performance measures can explain this pay difference. While female actors' underrepresentation in leading roles reflects consumer tastes and, therefore, reflects discriminatory attitudes, no evidence can be found for direct pay discrimination in Hollywood's movie business.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first Hollywood study to relying on a rich panel data set that includes various measures of the human capital characteristics of the different individual actors. This paper's theoretical contribution lies in applying classic labor economics reasoning to explain pay determination in Hollywood's movie business.",2023,,Gender in Management,38,6,747-769,2827238310,https://doi.org/10.1108/GM-12-2021-0385,,#1034,Kräft 2023,"",""
Decertifying Gender: The Challenge of Equal Pay,"Grabham, Emily","‘The Future of Legal Gender’ project has assessed the potential implications for feminist legal scholarship and activism of decertifying sex/gender. Decertification refers to the state moving away from officially determining or registering sex/gender. This article explores the potential impact of such moves on equal pay law and gender pay gap reporting. Equal pay and gender pay gap reporting laws provide an important focus for the project because they aim to address structural dynamics associated with persistent pay inequality that women experience across occupations in the United Kingdom. These legal measures illuminate gendering as a large-scale social problem widely understood to operate structurally and systemically. What effect, then, could decertifying sex/gender have on the law and conceptual power of equal pay? Might decertification undermine the structure of equal pay law, with all hard-won gains it has brought for women? Or is it possible to imagine that decertification could accompany a more inclusive and effective legal architecture for equal pay?",2023,,Feminist Legal Studies,31,1,67-93,2797451050,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10691-022-09516-3,,#1035,Grabham 2023,"",""
Psychometric assessment of the US person-centered prenatal and maternity care scales in a low-income predominantly Latinx population in California,"Afulani, Patience A; Coleman-Phox, Kimberly; Leon-Martinez, Daisy; Fung, Kathy Z; Martinez, Erica; Garza, Mary A; McCulloch, Charles E; Kuppermann, Miriam","ObjectivesTo assess psychometric properties of two scales developed to measure the quality of person-centered care during pregnancy and childbirth in the United States—the Person-Centered Prenatal Care (PCPC-US) and Person-Centered Maternity Care (PCMC-US) scales—in a low-income predominantly Latinx population in California.MethodsData were collected from July 2020 to June 2023 from surveys of low-income pregnant and birthing people in Fresno, California, participating in the “Engaging Mothers and Babies; Reimagining Antenatal Care for Everyone” (EMBRACE) trial. Research staff administered the 26-item PCPC-US scale at 30–34 weeks’ gestation (n = 315) and the 35-item PCMC-US scale at 10–14 weeks after birth (n = 286), using the language preferred by the participant (English or Spanish). We assessed construct, criterion, and known group validity and internal consistency of the scales.Results78% of respondents identified as Latinx. Factor analysis identified one dominant factor for each scale that accounted for over 60% of the cumulative variance, with most items loading at > 0.3. The items also loaded adequately on sub-scales for “dignity and respect,” “communication and autonomy,” and “responsive and supportive care.” Cronbach’s alpha for the full scales were > 0.9 and between 0.70 and 0.87 for the sub-scales. Summative scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher person-centered care. Correlations with scores on scales measuring prenatal care quality and birth experience provided evidence for criterion validity, while associations with known predictors provided evidence for known-group validity.ConclusionsThe PCPC-US and PCMC-US scales, which were developed using a community-engaged process and found to have good psychometric properties in a largely high-income sample of Black women, were shown to also have good psychometric properties in a sample of low-income primarily Latinx women. Both scales provide valid and reliable tools to measure person-centered care experiences among minoritized communities to support efforts to reduce existing birth inequities.",2023,,BMC Women's Health,23,,1-17,2902120838,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-023-02721-5,,#1036,Afulani 2023,"",""
Differential patterns of lifestyle behaviors among low- and high-income postmenopausal women in Korea: a latent class analysis,"Lee, Haein; Lee, Bo Gyeong; In Seo La","BackgroundHealthy lifestyle behaviors among postmenopausal women are important to prevent chronic diseases and improve health later in life. Heterogeneous lifestyle patterns may exist among postmenopausal women, and socioeconomic status (SES) is a critical determinant of lifestyle behaviors. However, little is known about distinct SES-specific patterns of lifestyle behaviors among postmenopausal women. Thus, this study used latent class analysis to identify subgroups of postmenopausal women with different health behaviors according to income and to examine the predictors of income-specific subgroups.MethodsWe analyzed nationally representative data from the Eighth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, collected in 2019 and 2020. We used nine lifestyles (i.e., current smoking and drinking, high-risk drinking, walking, muscle-strengthening exercise, sleep, vegetable and fruit intakes, and weight control efforts). We conducted a multiple-group latent class analysis using monthly household income as a proxy for SES. The monthly household income variable was calculated by standardizing monthly household income by the number of family members and then divided into quintiles. We classified the participants into low- (i.e., Q1 and Q2) and high-income (i.e., Q3, Q4, and Q5) groups.ResultsAlthough the three-class models best fit the data of low- and high-income groups, we found differential patterns by income: (a) for low-income group, “relatively healthy (RH),” “lowest physical activity, insufficient fruit intake, and no intention to control weight,” and “high-risk drinking and insufficient fruit intake” classes and (b) for high-income group, “RH,” “lowest physical activity,” “high-risk drinking and insufficient fruit intake and sleep” classes. The proportion of the RH class was largest in both groups. However, lifestyle patterns in low-income group showed multiple and unhealthy characteristics than those in high-income group.ConclusionsThis study suggests that different underlying lifestyle patterns exist in postmenopausal women with low- and high-income. To promote healthy behaviors among postmenopausal women, health professionals should develop and apply lifestyle interventions tailored to lifestyle pattern characteristics according to income.",2023,,BMC Women's Health,23,,1-11,2902120805,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-023-02767-5,,#1037,Lee 2023,"",""
Role of iron in the reduction of anemia among women of reproductive age in low-middle income countries: insights from systematic review and meta-analysis,"Sumera Aziz Ali; Razzaq, Shama; Aziz, Savera; Ahreen Allana; Arzina Aziz Ali; Naeem, Shahla; Khowaja, Nayab; Fazal Ur Rehman","BackgroundIron deficiency anemia is a common public health issue among women of reproductive age (WRA) because it can result in adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Although studies are undertaken to assess iron efficacy, some gaps and limitations in the existing literature need to be addressed. To fill the gaps, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the role of iron in reducing anemia among WRA in low-middle-income countries (LMICs).MethodsA comprehensive search strategy was used to search Medline through PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct for RCTs published between 2000 and 2020. The primary outcome was the mean change in hemoglobin level. We used standardized mean differences and their respective 95% CI to estimate the pooled effect. We used I2 statistics and Egger’s test to assess heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. This review was carried out in accordance with revised guidelines based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.ResultsThe findings showed that iron therapy improved hemoglobin and ferritin levels, though the results varied across studies. An overall pooled effect estimate for the role of iron therapy in improving the hemoglobin levels among WRA was -0.71 (95% CI: -1.27 to -0.14) (p = 0.008). Likewise, the overall pooled effect estimate for the role of iron therapy in improving the ferritin levels among WRA was -0.76 (95% CI: -1.56 to 0.04) (p = 0.04). The heterogeneity (I2) across included studies was found to be statistically significant for studies assessing hemoglobin (Q = 746.93, I2 = 97.59%, p = 0.000) and ferritin level (Q = 659.95, I2 = 97.88%, p = 0.000).ConclusionIron therapy in any form may reduce anemia’s burden and improve hemoglobin and ferritin levels, indicating improvement in iron-deficiency anemia. More evidence is required, however, to assess the morbidity associated with iron consumption, such as side effects, work performance, economic outcomes, mental health, and adherence to the intervention, with a particular focus on married but non-pregnant women planning a pregnancy in the near future.Trial registrationRegistered with PROSPERO and ID is CRD42020185033.",2023,,BMC Women's Health,23,,1-22,2803008344,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-023-02291-6,,#1038,SumeraAzizAli 2023,"",""
University Students Who Report Exchanging Sex for Money or Other Compensation: Findings from a Public University Sample,"Gerassi, Lara B.; Lowe, Sarah; Walsh, Kate","Whether and how university students exchange sex for financial compensation in the USA is critically understudied. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine whether undergraduate and graduate students at a large public university report exchanging sex for financial or other compensation, and identify factors (e.g., demographics, childhood adversity, mental health) associated with exchanging sex. Participants were 600 college students (Mage = 21.3 years [SD = 3.8]); 72% cisgender women; 43.4% racial/ethnic minority) from a large public university in the Northeastern USA who completed cross-sectional, online questionnaires about lifetime trauma, adversity exposure, sexual behaviors, and current mental health and substance use symptoms. A total of 4.5% of participants reported exchanging sex for money, alcohol/drugs, or other forms of compensation. Bivariate analysis revealed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans students (versus cisgender, heterosexual students), students who had more severe childhood trauma, who reported being removed from their family home in childhood, and students who were diagnosed with a mental health disorder before age 18 were more likely to report exchanging sex. In a multivariable model, only emotional neglect and greater alcohol use problems were significantly associated with likelihood of exchanging sex. To our knowledge, this is the first US study to determine whether university students exchange sex for money, alcohol/drugs, or other compensation. Findings suggest that universities could consider addressing exchanging sex in person-centered, supportive sexual health programming, university health services responses, and community spaces that support LGBTQ+ students.

This research uses the survey method; researchers received questionnaire responses from 857 respondents (457 respondents in East Java, and 400 respondents in West Sumatra). The results of this study indicate that the survival strategy of low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic is based on the strength of their existing social capital, especially with the support of their families and neighbors. Heavy reliance on their internal social capital creates heightened vulnerability; this study reveals that not all lowincome families receive assistance or benefits from the central or local governments. External assistance is pivotal to amplify their existing social capital and to enhance their resilience.

I show that arguments for and against basic income put forward by feminist theorists rely on implicit assumptions about how women's work should be conceived—assumptions that are not shared among all of them. I also argue that these beliefs can be sorted into two dichotomies: one concerned with the suitability of remuneration for caregiving, the other with the question of who should be responsible for caregiving.

The objective of this scoping review is to explore the extent of evidence available on the subject matter and identify knowledge gaps in the reviewed literature. We used the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework as a guide for this review and conducted searches on four electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and Google Scholar. Eligible studies were those published in English and French languages between 2013 and 2022 that discussed demand-side barriers to access and utilization of skilled birth care in low and lower-middle-income countries. Five themes emerged as major types of barriers influencing the utilization of skilled birth care in low and lower-middle-income countries. These were socio-economic and socio-demographic status of women; lack of access to healthcare facilities; cost of healthcare services; ineffective healthcare systems and socio-cultural/religious factors. The identified gap in the literature was the lack of studies on the influence of women's behaviour and psychological traits as barriers to the use of skilled birth care among reviewed publications. To design effective interventions, it is important to consider all influential factors that determine the utilization of skilled birth care by women in low-resource settings.

This finding is consistent with a recent wave of research indicating greater preferences for women politicians. Which respondents rate women politicians more highly, and why?

Instead, respondent partisanship and the presumed partisanship of the politician account for a great deal of our findings, with gender playing a complicating role. Democratic and Republican respondents are apt to project their own partisanship onto politicians, and across both parties, we find higher assessments for co-partisan politicians and for women politicians.

Does Enhancing Paid Maternity Leave Policy Help Promote Gender Equality? Evidence from 31 Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"Chai, Yan; Ríos-Salas, Vanessa; Stek, Pam; Heymann, Jody","Globally, women continue to have less economic decision-making power and face gender-unequal norms at work. Little is known about the impact of national public policies on norms surrounding equality. We examined the impact of extending paid maternity leave policy on decision making in the household and gender norms in the workplace, specifically whether women have sole or joint decision-making power with respect to large household purchases and whether women are perceived as having an equal right to jobs when jobs are scarce. We used difference-in-differences models to analyze the impact of increasing paid maternity leave on outcomes measured in the Demographic Health Surveys and World Values Surveys collected in 31 low- and middle-income countries. A one-month increase in the legislated duration of paid maternity leave increased the odds that women and their partners/spouses reported that women had more decision-making power by 40% (95% CI 1.14, 1.70) and 66% (95% CI 1.36, 2.03), respectively. A one-month increase in the legislated duration of paid maternity leave was associated with 41.5 percentage-point increase in the prevalence of individuals disagreeing with the statement that “when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women.” More generous maternity leave increases gender equality in economic decision making in the household and improves gender norms related to work.

We identified individual, cultural/traditional and religious, societal, health system, and structural barriers to screening. Lack of knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer in general and of screening were the most frequent individual level barriers. Cultural/traditional and religious barriers included prohibition of screening and unsupportive partners and families, while social barriers were largely driven by community misconceptions. Health system barriers included policy and programmatic factors, and structural barriers were related to geography, education and cost. Underlying reasons for these barriers included limited information about cervical cancer and screening as a preventive strategy, poorly resourced health systems that lacked policies or implemented them poorly, generalised limited access to health services, and gender norms that deprioritize the health needs of women.Conclusion A wide range of barriers to screening were identified across most LMICs.

However, much of the work around measuring this construct has been done in high-income geographies, with very little representation from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). To fill this gap, and guide future research in low resource settings, we aim to summarize best evidence measures of collective efficacy for women and girls from LMICs.Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched five databases for English language peer-reviewed literature on measures of collective efficacy, published between 1 January 2009 and 25 August 2020. In addition, we sought expert input for relevant papers in this area. Research staff screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles in a double-blind review. Inclusion criteria were: (i) original quantitative analysis, and (ii) sample limited to women/girls only (≥ 100), residing in LMICs.Results We identified 786 unique articles, 14 of which met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies captured a diversity of population groups, including pregnant women, recent mothers, adolescent girls, and female sex workers, from across national settings. Two broad constructs of collective efficacy were captured by the measures: (i) group dynamics, and (ii) collective action. All 14 studies included items on group dynamics in their measures, whereas seven studies included items on collective action. Four studies validated new measures of collective efficacy, and seven provided evidence supporting the relationship between collective efficacy and outcomes related to women’s well-being. Overall, measures demonstrated good reliability and validity when tested, and those testing for associations or effects found a positive relationship of collective efficacy with women’s health behaviors.Conclusion The past decade has resulted in a number of new collective efficacy measures demonstrating good validity in terms of their associations with key health outcomes among women and girls from across LMIC settings, but there remains no standard measure in the field. Those that exist focus on group dynamics, but less often on collective action. A standard measure of collective efficacy inclusive of group dynamics and collective action can support better understanding of the value of women’s collectives across national settings and populations.",2022,,BMC Women's Health,22,,1-20,2666181371,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-022-01688-z,,#1052,Dehingia 2022,"",""

The study adopted a descriptive survey research type of the nonexperimental design. The population consisted of all professional counselors in secondary schools in Ekiti State. The sample for the study consisted of 100 professional counselors in secondary schools in Ekiti State. The sample was selected using multistage sampling procedure. Data on counselors gender, compensation, morale and job performance were obtained using a self-designed research instrument tagged Predictors of Job Performance of Professional Counselors Questionnaire. The face and content validity of the instrument was determined by experts in Counseling, Tests and Measurement. The reliability of the instrument was determined through Cronbach s alpha statistic. A reliability co-efficient of 0.79, showing that the instrument is reliable. The data collected were analyzed using frequency count and percentages. Three hypotheses formulated were tested with the use of t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. The major findings of the study were that compensation and job performance were significantly positively correlated, while morale and job performance were not significantly correlated among the sample of the study. Moreover, there was a significant gender difference in the moral of professional counselors. It was recommended that government should promulgate law that will enable counselors in secondary schools fully practice their profession without the addition of other teaching subjects. This will enhance their focus on assisting students in adjusting positively to their academic pursuits.",2021,,Gender & Behaviour,19,3,18544-18550,2629425702,,,#1053,Bolanle 2021,"",""

Women’s Income-generating Activity and Experiences of Economic Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Bangladesh,"Miedema, Stephanie Spaid; Hennink Monique; Naved Ruchira Tabassum; Talukder Aloka; Dore, Emily C; Yount, Kathryn M","Economic coercion is a form of intimate partner violence (IPV) that is distinct from but often co-occurs with physical, psychological, and sexual IPV. Women’s experiences of economic coercion are understudied in low- and middle-income countries, despite increases in women’s economic opportunities in these settings. Bangladesh is a salient site to understand how women experience, interpret and give meaning to economic coercion because historical gender inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources are changing in favor of greater participation of women in economic activities. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 24 married women aged 19–47 years to understand their experiences of economic coercion with respect to their involvement in income-generating activities in rural Bangladesh. Overall, we found that women’s experiences of economic coercion were multi-dimensional, and influenced by women’s participation in income-generating activities. In this setting, three major domains of economic coercion by husbands emerged from women’s narratives: denial of access to income-generating activities, coercive control over resources, and economic neglect. Furthermore, participant narratives reflected the continued influence of the patriarchal family system, and the gendered power relations therein, on women’s experiences of economic coercion, despite increases in women’s involvement in income-generating activities. Our results suggest that women’s experiences of economic coercion influence their participation in income-generating activities in Matlab, Bangladesh.

Men who pay for sex (MPS) are considered a bridging population for HIV infection. However, the characteristics of MPS in Mozambique are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of paid sex among men 15–49 years and investigate risk factors associated with paid sex. We analyzed data collected from 4724 men, aged 15–49 years, as part of the 2015 Mozambique AIDS Indicator Survey. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models accounting for survey design were used to assess the associations between paying for sex and demographic characteristics and the number of lifetime and recent sex partners, condom use at last sex, and self-reported sexually transmitted infection symptoms. The prevalence of paid sex in the last 12 months was 10.4% (95% CI 9.0–12.1), with Cabo Delgado province having the highest prevalence (38.8%). MPS in the last 12 months were most frequently between the ages of 20–24 years (13.5%), not in a relationship (17.8%), had a primary education (11.9%), from poor households (14.0%), had more than three sexual partners excluding their spouse in the last 12 months (44.7%), and self-reported a STI in the past 12 months (44.2%).

Wage Inequality of Women in Professional Tennis of the Leading International Tournaments: Gender Equality vs Market Discrimination?,"Cepeda, Isabel","This essay is framed in the transformative role that sports can play in gender relations. Particularly, this essay addresses the analysis of gender pay inequality in professional tennis. Although the economic analysis offers the instruments to determine the remuneration of equilibrium in the labor market, an analytical economic view may not be sufficient when ethical elements intervene, such as social justice, equity and the fight for gender equality. The methodology consisted of searching for, and collecting data on various aspects of professional tennis, with special emphasis on: a) the prizes money received by male and female professional tennis players who compete in the most important tournaments of the main international tennis organizations; and b) the income generated by professional tennis players for the companies organizing these tournaments. The essay applies economic theory to identify equilibrium wages in this industry. The article contributes to the literature in three ways: first, it provides the collection of data on gender discrimination in professional tennis; second, it shows that the inequality of awards between men and women responds to differences in labor productivity; and third, it puts forward measures for the equalization of awards between men and women without business damage.

Protective and Compensatory Effects of Group Identification on the Mental Health of People Living with HIV,"Chan Randolph C H; Mak, Winnie W, S","Despite persistent stigmatization of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the globe, group identification among these individuals may serve to counteract the detrimental effect of prejudice and discrimination associated with the stigmatized identity. Drawing on resilience theory and social identity theory, this study examined how multiple dimensions of group identification (i.e., in-group ties, in-group affect, and centrality) function to buffer and neutralize the negative impact of HIV stigma. A total of 281 PLHIV were recruited from the only community-based public HIV clinic in Hong Kong to participate in this study. The results revealed a protective effect of in-group affect, which moderated the relationship between HIV stigma and mental health, such that HIV stigma was not associated with mental health among people with higher positive in-group affect. In addition, a positive compensatory effect of in-group ties was found in people with higher HIV identity centrality. Given the protective effect of in-group affect, it is important to re-story the lives among PLHIV by challenging their maladaptive beliefs about being PLHIV and building a positive sense of identity in their personal narratives. Community-based interventions should be provided to individuals with higher HIV identity centrality by offering peer support groups and engaging them in community work.",2021,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,50,4,1677-1687,2542532528,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01823-7,,#1059,ChanRandolphC 2021,"",""

Land expropriation without compensation : the challenges of Black South African women in land ownership,"Mubecua, Mandla Abednico; Nojiyeza, Simphiwe","South African Black women relied on the land for the generation of livelihood. However, since 1994, the number of Black women who own land is lower than men. It is undeniable that the shortage of land among Black women is a true reflection of ineffective land reform policies (Land redistribution, restitution and tenure). This land reform is criticised for pushing the Willing Buyer Willing Seller policy, which is considered as a capitalist system that supports private ownership (majority are Whites ). As a result, Land Expropriation without Compensation (LEWC) was introduced to nationalize South African land, to address racial inequality and also gender inequality in land ownership. Therefore, the present study aims to examine if the LEWC will help in addressing gender differences in land ownership. The paper depends on secondary sources as a means of gathering relevant and necessary data. It is also used strict textual analysis of the existing literature. The findings show that, just like other policies of the land reform, the LEWC might fail to address the challenges of land faced by Black women in South Africa because of some existing elements of customary law.

More research is needed because sterilization decisions can reveal complex social relationships built on gender, class, race, and power that resonate throughout many parts of societies. The present paper draws on ideas of power/agency as they intersect with gender, race, and class in an analysis of 40 semi-structured interviews of a racially/ethnically diverse group of low-income U.S. women with male partners as they recall their sterilization discussions with their intimate partners before they themselves were voluntarily sterilized. The results offer insight into how class and racial and gender norms influence reproductive behaviors. Whereas a majority of these women displayed agency in female sterilization decisions, they had little control over male partners’ vasectomy decisions, which they attributed to their place in a racial/ethnic and gender hierarchy by utilizing ambiguous, unidimensional definitions of “machismo.” These results give insights into the conceptual complexity of contraceptive power and control as well as understandings of how gendered and racialized norms at individual and structural levels influence reproductive behaviors and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes of both men and women.",2019,,Sex Roles,81,11-12,748-764,2187709213,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-019-01027-x,,#1069,Leyser-Whalen 2019,"",""
Exploring Comfort Levels and the Role of Compensation in Sexual Psychophysiology Study Participation,"Huberman, Jackie S; McInnis, Meghan K; Bouchard, Katrina N; Dawson, Samantha J; Pukall, Caroline F; Chivers, Meredith L","A number of devices have been developed to assess physiological sexual response. Some come into direct contact with the genitals (e.g., vaginal/clitoral/penile plethysmography [VPP/CPP/PPG], labial thermistors [LT]), whereas others capture images of the genitals remotely (e.g., thermal imaging [TI], laser Doppler imaging [LDI]). Researchers have speculated about the relative invasiveness of these measurement tools, with limited empirical work examining participants’ perceptions of different devices and how these may impact volunteer bias. We investigated individuals’ levels of comfort with participating in hypothetical sexual psychophysiology studies and their reasons for discomfort. We also examined the relationship between comfort level and compensation for participation. Men (n = 291) and women (n = 716) completed an online survey where they were presented with vignettes describing studies using VPP, CPP, PPG, LT, TI, and LDI. Participants reported their comfort level with the idea of participating in each study, the amount of compensation that would be reasonable, and factors influencing their decision not to participate if they were unwilling. Participants were similarly comfortable with some studies involving genital contact (VPP) or remote imaging (TI), and somewhat less comfortable with others (LDI, LT, PPG; small or small-medium effect sizes). Along with our qualitative analysis, these findings reveal that direct genital contact is one aspect of study intrusiveness, but that it is not necessarily the most important study feature influencing comfort with participation.

The article specifically examines existing literature on the experiences and challenges facing WWPD in accessing and utilization of these services during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-natal period. Fifteen studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Findings from the review highlight that pregnancy and motherhood are meaningful for WWPD in both individual and socio-cultural ways. Multiple challenges facing WWPD were identified, including low self-esteem and confidence, negative responses and lack of family support, problematic experiences of transport, health and other social systems for maternal healthcare of WWPD, and social unacceptance and discrimination from the community. Addressing barriers in accessing healthcare services was perceived as an individual responsibility of WWPD and their families, rather than perceptions that society had a responsibility to act. The reproductive rights of WWPD, particularly expression of sexuality and the right to motherhood needs to be conceptualized beyond individual responsibility. Society needs to eliminate attitudinal and environmental barriers to ensure WWPD can choose to be mothers without threat of discrimination or negative social consequences.",2019,,Sexuality and Disability,37,2,175-201,2201460109,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11195-019-09564-9,,#1072,Nguyen 2019,"",""

Gender Injustice in Compensating Injury to Autonomy in English and Singaporean Negligence Law,"Keren-Paz, Tsachi","The extent to which English law remedies injury to autonomy (ITA) as a stand-alone actionable damage in negligence is disputed. In this article I argue that the remedy available is not only partial and inconsistent (Keren-Paz in Med Law Rev, 2018) but also gendered and discriminatory against women. I first situate the argument within the broader feminist critique of tort law as failing to appropriately remedy gendered harms, and of law more broadly as undervaluing women’s interest in reproductive autonomy. I then show by reference to English remedies law’s first principles how imposed motherhood cases—Rees v Darlington and its predecessor McFarlane v Tayside Health Board—result in gender injustice when compared with other autonomy cases such as Chester v Afshar and Yearworth v North Bristol NHS Trust: A minor gender-neutral ITA is better remedied than the significant gendered harm of imposing motherhood on the claimant; men’s reproductive autonomy is protected to a greater extent than women’s; women’s reproductive autonomy is protected by an exceptional, derisory award. Worst of all, courts refuse to recognise imposed motherhood as detriment; and the deemed, mansplained, nonpecuniary joys of motherhood are used to offset pecuniary upkeep costs, forcing the claimant into a position she sought to avoid and thus further undermining her autonomy. The recent Singaporean case ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd, awarding compensation for undermining the claimant’s genetic affinity in an IVF wrong-sperm-mix-up demonstrates some improvement in comparison to English law, and some shared gender injustices in the context of reproductive autonomy. ACB’s analysis is oblivious to the nature of reproductive autonomy harm as gendered; and prioritises the father’s interest in having genetic affinity with the baby over a woman’s interest in not having motherhood imposed upon her.",2019,,Feminist Legal Studies,27,1,33-55,2136796053,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10691-018-9390-3,,#1074,Keren-Paz 2019,"",""
"""We Will See That You Are Troubled Right Along"": Women and the Politics of the Early Federal Income Tax","Zelenak, Lawrence","The explanation seems to be that, although women broke out of the purely domestic sphere during the Progressive Era and became prominent participants in policy debates, most of their participation was on a few issues closely identified with women's concerns-most notably, perhaps, suffrage and temperance.3 Thus, although policy debates were no longer a uniquely male separate sphere, different policy issues had their own gendered spheres, and the tax-policy sphere was male.4 On the other hand, it is in the nature of an income tax to reach deeply into the lives of its taxpayers-requiring them not only to pay tax, but also to report their incomes and calculate their tax liabilities, and varying tax liabilities on the basis of (among many other things) marital status.A man with income of $4,000 could reduce his taxable income from $1,000 to zero by marrying a woman with no income of her own; and a man and a woman each having an income of $3,000 would increase their taxable income from zero to $2,000 by marrying.8 While the final legislative product (as interpreted by the Treasury Department) resulted in both penalties and bonuses for married couples, the Ways and Means Committee's earlier version of the income tax bill had called for large marriage penalties and no bonuses.A shorter version of the same letter appeared in the New York Times about two weeks later, under the correct name of Helen M. Bent.12 One can only speculate as to whether Bent's objection had any influence on the final legislative product, but by reducing the single person exemption to $3,000 (while keeping the married couple exemption at $4,000) Congress both decreased income tax marriage penalties (relative to the House bill) and created the prospect of marriage bonuses.According to her New York Times obituary, ""[s]he received a law degree from New York university, but never practiced, preferring to devote her time to suffrage and prison reform work.",2019,,Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy,27,1,279-295,2425834295,,,#1075,Zelenak 2019,"",""
Can mental health treatments help prevent or reduce intimate partner violence in low- and middle-income countries?

However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined ‘mental health treatment’ as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated.Results We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions.Conclusions Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.",2019,,BMC Women's Health,19,,,2183004537,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-019-0728-z,,#1076,Tol 2019,"",""

Using data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79), we follow the same individuals over 4 years and analyze their data using a cross-lagged structural equation model.

When looking at a subsample of stay-at-home parents, we find that a change from providing some share of the family income to stay-at-home parent status over time is related to higher level of depressive symptoms among fathers but not mothers.

Using a survey of newly graduated highly educated men and women in five occupations in Sweden (engineers, lawyers, police officers, social workers and psychologists, n ≈ 2400), we examine (a) if personality traits—measured as Big Five traits, risk-taking and self-esteem—differ between men and women (b) if differences in personality traits are systematically related to the gender composition of the occupation, (c) if individuals who have chosen an occupation dominated by the other gender are gender-atypical in their personalities and, (d) how personality traits are related to wages and the gender wage gap. The results show significant gender differences in agreeableness, emotional stability and perceived risk-taking. The male-dominated occupations score higher on risk-taking than those dominated by females, but the pattern for agreeableness is less clear and the scores on emotional stability are no higher in these occupations. Further we find that individuals who have chosen a gender-atypical occupation tend to display gender atypical personality traits. In line with previous research, we find that risk-taking and self-esteem are positively related to wages but these associations do not account for gender differences in wages.

INTERSECTIONALITY SQUARED: INTRASTATE MINIMUM WAGE PREEMPTION & SCHUETTE'S SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS,"Johnson, Alexsis M","The Political Process Doctrine In addition to the conventional equal protection doctrine, which mandates that courts evaluate legislation that makes racial and gendered classifications under strict scrutiny,17 the Supreme Court has also articulated a second strand of equal protection jurisprudence known as the political process rationale or the political process doctrine.18 The ""simple but central principle"" embodied by the political process doctrine is that the state may not make it more difficult for certain minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest by placing special burdens on minorities within the governmental process.19 Though each of the Supreme Court cases that explicitly invoke the political process doctrine involved questions of whether a political restructuring amounted to an instance of race-based discrimination, the political process rationale has also been invoked by lower courts in the interest of discrete minority groups not recognized as protected classes under the Fourteenth Amendment.20 Perhaps the most notable difference between the conventional equal protection doctrine and the political process doctrine is the absence of an explicit intent requirement from the latter.21 The political process doctrine instructs courts to identify and scrutinize state actions, decision making structures, and schemes that place ""special burdens"" on minorities seeking to advocate for their interests through the political process.22 Under the political process rationale, political restructurings are inherently atypical; at a minimum, they signal the intention of the political majority to alter or circumscribe the usual legislative process.23 As Courts have examined facially neutral political restructurings under more careful scrutiny to protect against entrenched or concealed discrimination against minorities.24 The Court has previously applied the doctrine to invalidate political restructuring that singles out a disadvantaged or minority group as the only group that must undertake atypical or additional steps-like obtaining a city charter amendment, state constitution amendment, or ballot initiative-as a precursor to enact legislation in favor of group interests.25 An application of the political process doctrine may invalidate a political restructuring that shifts decision-making power regarding a particular issue from one kind of process to another.26 A court may also find that a shift of decision-making power from one level or branch of government to another level, like a state charter amendment prohibiting localities from passing legislation to curb racial discrimination in real estate, is similarly impermissible.27 2.In each of the three cities, the minority population in the cities is disproportionate compared the minority population of the states as a whole.69 The unemployment rate of Black residents as compared to white residents is significantly higher.70 Recent events in Birmingham, Alabama exemplify how the current political strategy of intrastate preemption of progressive measures raises a number of equality concerns.71 Minimum wage workers in Alabama currently receive pay of $7.25 per hour, the national floor set by federal law.72 In August 2015, the Mayor of Birmingham and the Birmingham City Council unanimously passed Ordinance 15-124, which provided for an incremental increase in the minimum wage for Birmingham employees, starting with $8.50 per hour in July 2016 and increasing to $10.10 per hour in July 2017.73 In response to the Birmingham ordinance, the Alabama state legislature enacted the Alabama Uniform Minimum Wage and Right to Work Act (""Act 2016-18""), which effectively nullified Birmingham's minimum wage ordinance and preempted municipalities in the state from raising the minimum wage above $7.25 an hour or requiring that employers provide any paid or unpaid leave, or vacation pay that is not required by federal or state law.74 Act 2016-18 closely imitates the Living Wage Mandate Preemption Act, model legislation circulated by The American Legislative Exchange Council (""ALEC""), an organization with a membership that includes many of the nation's largest companies, a quarter of state legislators, one-fifth of the United States Congress, and seven sitting governors.75 ALEC justifies their model preemption legislation and advocacy for intrastate preemption of local labor protections on the basis that states require consistent labor laws and state legislatures are best positioned to achieve that consistency.76 However, despite the assertion that states should regulate labor, ALEC has simultaneously advocated for cities and counties to enact ""right-to-work"" ordinances at the local level.77 Of particular significance to the pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of Alabama's Act 2016-18 are the racial demographics of the municipality the legislation targets and the lawmakers responsible for passing the preemptive measure.78 In Birmingham, Alabama, Black Americans account for seventy-five percent of the city population, yet the population of the whole State of Alabama is seventy-five percent white.79 Act 2016-18 passed with the exclusive support of fifty-three white legislators-no Black legislator voted in favor of the bill.80 The Alabama legislature also passed Act 2016-18 with uncharacteristic speed-the bill passed within one week after the first reading and was signed by Governor Robert Bentley within two hours.81 Yet, notwithstanding the various procedural anomalies in the passing of Act 2016-18, Alabama's preemption of the Birmingham ordinance unfolded in very similar fashion to several other examples of intrastate preemption of higher local minimum wages in the past few years.82 These procedural anomalies and racial disparities, coupled with a shift in decision-making power regarding labor protections from the local level to the state level effectuated by Act 2016-18 implicate the political process doctrine.83 The facts around Alabama's Act 2016-18 and the NAACP's legal challenge of Act 2016-18 also highlight a deficiency in the doctrine with regard to intersectional harms.""103 The complaint identifies significant disparities in unemployment rates among racial groups, significant disparities in levels of income and wealth, home ownership, educational attainment, and in poverty rates as vestiges of de jure discrimination.104 The complaint goes on to argue that due to the dearth of Black state-wide elected officials and racialized political gerrymandering, Black communities have no effective representation at the state level and thus no political recourse to address these vestiges of de jure discrimination at the state-wide level.105 The District Court judge granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and the NAACP appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.106 An amicus brief submitted by the Partnership for Working Families and the Southern Poverty Law Center in support of the NAACP's position does acknowledge the even steeper wage discrepancies between Black women and white men in Alabama.107 However, the main thrust of the amicus argument closely parallels the NAACP's framing of the invalidity of Act as race discrimination, separate from any kind of gender-based discrimination.108 Demographic data on the racial makeup of Birmingham and the communities therein shows that most of the people relying on low-wage jobs are people of color.109 This demographic data supports the NAACP's claim that Act 2016-28 effectuates a disparate impact on low-income communities of color and specifically highlights a significant negative impact on Black Americans.110 Empirical data also shows that racial minorities make up a larger portion of the population of the cities that are the recent sites of these preemption measures.111 Though the state representative who introduced Act 2016-18 lives in an area of Alabama that is ninety-seven percent white and one of the wealthiest communities in the country, Birmingham is seventy-three percent Black and thirty percent of its residents live in poverty.112 However, as the next section discusses, a closer look of how intrastate minimum wage preemption impacts sub-groups within larger racial minority groups demonstrates how these kinds of preemptive measures arguably amount to race- and gender-based discrimination.[...]Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent joined by Justice Ginsburg. 153 Schuette, 134 S.

FEMALE NECESSITY AND OPPORTUNITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP: A STUDY OF INCOME LEVEL AND SOCIAL PROGRESS,"Waseem, Ansar","The number of female owned enterprises is gradually increasing as more and more women are starting their own businesses. This has encouraged, governments, policy makers, and scholars to focus on unearthing different individual, social, and economic factors, which can promote female entrepreneurial activities. However, a majority of the studies concerning female entrepreneurial activities have focused on their overall level of business start-ups. These studies have failed to delineate between necessity based and opportunity driven entrepreneurship. Moreover, little empirical work is done to investigate how different economic, social, and cultural factors shape women's entrepreneurial initiatives. This study aims to fill the gap in the extant literature by investigating the impact of economic development and social progress on necessity based and opportunity driven entrepreneurship among females. For this purpose, data regarding different types of female entrepreneurship was collected from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, while Gross National Income, the Social Progress Index, and the Human Capital Index were used as measures to capture economic and social factors. Regression Analysis using the Ordinary Least Square method was used for hypothesis testing. Results of this study indicate that GNI per capita, social progress and human development are positively related with opportunity driven female entrepreneurship, while the same predictors are negatively associated with necessity-based entrepreneurship among women. Moreover, GNI per capita, social progress and human development have a U-shaped relationship with overall female entrepreneurship implying that at the left side of the curve, necessity-based entrepreneurship is more prominent, while on the other side opportunitydriven entrepreneurship dominates. This finding shows that distinguishing between different types of entrepreneurship can provide more nuanced explanations regarding effects of different social and economic initiatives to foster entrepreneurial activities among women.",2018,,Pakistan Journal of Women's Studies = Alam-e-Niswan = Alam-i Nisvan,25,1,127-149,2069494192,,,#1087,Waseem 2018,"",""
Intimate Partner Violence and Uptake of Antenatal Care: A Scoping Review of Low- and Middle-Income Country Studies,"Metheny, Nicholas; Stephenson, Rob","Contexto: La violencia de pareja íntima (VPI) se asocia con resultados negativos en la salud física y mental. La atención prenatal puede actuar como un enlace con los servicios de VPI, pero la experiencia de VPI puede estar asociada con un menor uso de la atención prenatal, tema que ha recibido poca atención por parte de los investigadores. Métodos: Se realizó una revisión de alcance para sintetizar la investigación cuantitativa sobre VPI y el uso de la atención prenatal en entornos de bajos recursos. Se realizaron búsquedas de palabras clave en PubMed y otras bases de datos, así como búsquedas en bola de nieve de listas de referencias para identificar artículos publicados en el período 2005-2015 que medían uno o más tipos de VPI (física, sexual o emocional) o comportamiento de control, y evaluaban la relación de dicho abuso con el uso de la atención prenatal. Para cada artículo identificado se resumieron tanto las características clave como los hallazgos y se evaluó la calidad del estudio. Resultados: Dieciséis artículos representativos de 10 países de ingresos bajos y medios cumplieron con los criterios de inclusión. La mayoría de los estudios fueron de calidad media a alta pero de bajo rigor, lo cual es reflejo de la abundancia de estudios transversales en la literatura. En los 16 estudios, la VPI se asoció negativamente con el inicio de la atención prenatal, el número de visitas o el hecho de recurrir a un proveedor capacitado. Los análisis revelaron probabilidades de uso de la atención prenatal reducidas entre las mujeres que habían experimentado VPI (razón de probabilidades, 0.5-0.8) y elevadas probabilidades de uso de la atención prenatal entre las mujeres que no habían experimentado VPI o ningún uso entre las mujeres que habían experimentado VPI (1.2-4.1). Conclusión: Las mujeres en entornos de bajos recursos que experimentan VPI tienen menores probabilidades de obtener atención prenatal óptima y pueden beneficiarse de las intervenciones para mitigar los obstáculos a la atención.Alternate abstract:Contexte: La violence aux mains d'un partenaire intime (VPI) est associée à des résultats de santé physique et mentale négatifs. Si les soins prénatals peuvent servir à la mise en lien avec les services contre la VPI, l'expérience de la VPI peut néanmoins être associée à une réduction du recours à ces mêmes soins; une question sur laquelle la recherche ne s'est guère penchée. Méthodes: Une étude exploratoire a été menée pour synthétiser la recherche quantitative sur la VPI et le recours aux soins prénatals dans les contextes à faibles ressources. Des recherches par mots-clés ont été effectuées dans PubMed et autres bases de données, de même que des recherches en boule de neige dans les listes de référence afin d'identifier les articles publiés au cours de la période 2005-2015 qui mesuraient un ou plusieurs types de VPI (physique, sexuelle ou psychologique) ou comportement dominateur et évaluaient le rapport entre cette maltraitance et le recours aux soins prénatals. Pour chaque article identifié, les caractéristiques et conclusions principales ont été extraites et la qualité de l'étude a été évaluée. Résultats: Seize articles, représentant 10 pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire, ont répondu aux critères d'inclusion.

Antenatal care can act as a link to IPV services, but experiencing IPV may be associated with reduced uptake of antenatal care, an issue that has received little attention from researchers. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize quantitative research on IPV and uptake of antenatal care in low-resource settings. Keyword searches of PubMed and other databases and snowball searches of reference lists were conducted to identify articles published in 2005-2015 that measured one or more types of IPV (physical, sexual or emotional) or controlling behavior and assessed the relationship of such abuse with use of antenatal care. For each identified article, key characteristics and findings were abstracted, and study quality was assessed. RESULTS: Sixteen articles, representing 10 low- and middle-income countries, met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were of medium-to-high quality but low rigor, reflecting the abundance of cross-sectional studies in the literature. In all 16 studies, IPV was negatively associated with initiation of antenatal care, number of visits or use of a skilled provider.

Employee's perception as reflected in self reports constituted the central features of a model underlying the study, as perception is believed to be related to the individual experience. A total sample comprising 632 married dual-income earners drawn from human service oriented public and private organisations, participated in the study organisations. They consist of 119 males and 159 females from the public sector, and 141 males and 213 female from the private sector. The study was anchored on the Role-Strain Theory (Greenhaus & Beutell 1985) and Job-Demand-Control model (Karasek, 1979). Participants responded to Work-Family Conflict, Family-Work Conflict, Stress Symptom Checklist. The data collected were analyzed using Chi-square contingency analysis, independent t-test and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Result obtained showed that: (i) female workers generally reported high level of work-family conflict compared to male workers (ii) work-family conflict was higher among male workers who have at least 3 children who were above 6 years of age (iii) female workers that have family support in form of assistant of family members, house helps and support of neigbours, reported less family-work conflict (iv) work-family conflict was higher among private sector workers compared to their counterparts in the public sector. (v) Physical stress was higher among male and female in the private sector compared to male/public sector workers. Based on these findings recommendations were made on the need for organisations to mount intervention programmes that would minimize the strains occasioned by the nature of modern work structure and thereby reduce inter-role conflicts.

Prevalence and predictors of anxiety disorders amongst low-income pregnant women in urban South Africa: a cross-sectional study,"Thandi van Heyningen; Honikman, Simone; Myer, Landon; Onah, Michael N; Field, Sally; Tomlinson, Mark","Anxiety is highly prevalent in many populations; however, the burden of anxiety disorders amongst pregnant women in low-resource settings is not well documented. We investigated the prevalence and predictors of antenatal anxiety disorders amongst low-income women living with psychosocial adversity. Pregnant women were recruited from an urban, primary level clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnostic interview assessed prevalence of anxiety disorders. Four self-report questionnaires measured psychosocial characteristics. Logistic regression models explored demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, psychosocial risk factors and psychiatric comorbidity as predictors for anxiety disorders. Amongst 376 participants, the prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 23%. Although 11% of all women had post-traumatic stress disorder, 18% of the total sample was diagnosed with other anxiety disorders. Multivariable analysis revealed several predictors for anxiety including a history of mental health problems (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03–8.32), Major depressive episode (MDE) diagnosis (AOR 3.83; CI 1.99–7.31), multigravidity (AOR 2.87; CI 1.17–7.07), food insecurity (AOR 2.57; CI 1.48–4.46), unplanned and unwanted pregnancy (AOR 2.14; CI 1.11–4.15), pregnancy loss (AOR 2.10; CI 1.19–3.75) and experience of threatening life events (AOR 1.30; CI 1.04–1.57). Increased perceived social support appeared to reduce the risk for antenatal anxiety (AOR 0.95; CI 0.91–0.99).

Prenatal care: associations with prenatal depressive symptoms and social support in low-income urban women,"Sidebottom, Abbey C; Hellerstedt, Wendy L; Harrison, Patricia A; Jones-webb, Rhonda J","We examined associations of depressive symptoms and social support with late and inadequate prenatal care in a low-income urban population. The sample was prenatal care patients at five community health centers. Measures of depressive symptoms, social support, and covariates were collected at prenatal care entry. Prenatal care entry and adequacy came from birth certificates. We examined outcomes of late prenatal care and less than adequate care in multivariable models. Among 2341 study participants, 16% had elevated depressive symptoms, 70% had moderate/poor social support, 21% had no/low partner support, 37% had late prenatal care, and 29% had less than adequate prenatal care. Women with both no/low partner support and elevated depressive symptoms were at highest risk of late care (AOR 1.85, CI 1.31, 2.60, p < 0.001) compared to women with both good partner support and low depressive symptoms. Those with good partner support and elevated depressive symptoms were less likely to have late care (AOR 0.74, CI 0.54, 1.10, p = 0.051). Women with moderate/high depressive symptoms were less likely to experience less than adequate care compared to women with low symptoms (AOR 0.73, CI 0.56, 0.96, p = 0.022).

Do auditor and CFO gender matter to earnings quality? Evidence from Sweden,"Nasution, Damai; Jonnergård, Karin","Purpose This study aims to examine the association between auditor and chief financial officer (CFO) gender and earnings quality, utilising data from Sweden. This study also aims to examine whether interactions between auditor and CFO, which may affect a firm's earnings quality, are associated with their gender. These aims are inspired by the notion that gender differences will be overruled by the rewards and socialisation into the occupational roles as suggested by the structural approach to gender. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a multivariate regression model to test its hypotheses. The sample consists of 976 firm-year observations covering the period 2008 to 2013. Findings The results show that gender of the auditor and CFO is not associated with earnings quality, and the interactions between auditors and CFOs, which may affect earnings quality, are not associated with their gender. Consequently, the results give tentative support for the structural approach in gender studies in the accounting and auditing field. Research limitations/implications This study indicates that future research in gender studies should consider the structural approach based on the argument of gender similarities. This approach contends that work-related behaviour of women will more resemble men, and this is caused by the socialisation process into the occupational role and the structure where they work (e.g. organisational and professional culture, work conditions, a compensation scheme, national culture, etc.) instead of gender. Originality/value This study contributes to the understanding whether gender - auditor and CFO gender - is associated with firms' earnings quality and standing whether the interactions between auditor and CFO are associated with their gender, something that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been tested previously.

Multipartner Fertility in Nicaragua: Complex Family Formation in a Low-Income Setting,"Schmeer, Kammi K; Hays, Jake","Multipartner fertility (having children with more than one partner) is an important topic in demographic research, but little is known about its incidence and correlates in low-income settings, where rates may be high because of poverty, union instability and early childbearing. Data from the 2011-2012 Encuesta Nicaragüense de Demografía y Salud were used to calculate the prevalence of multipartner fertility among 8,320 mothers and 2,141 fathers with two or more children. Logistic and multinomial regression were used to identify individual and family characteristics associated with multipartner fertility. Among those with multiple children, 33% of mothers and 41% of fathers had had children with more than one partner. The prevalence of multipartner fertility was elevated among less-educated women, nonreligious men, and women and men who had grown up in urban areas (odds ratios, 1.3-1.6). Multipartner fertility was associated with lower current household wealth among mothers, and with increased risk of single parenthood and higher fertility among mothers and fathers. Fathers who had had multiple fertility partners were six times as likely as fathers with one fertility partner to report not providing financial support to, or sharing their surname with, at least one of their biological children.

Working-class, dual-earner couples (n=108) in the U.S Northeast were interviewed at five time points from the third trimester of pregnancy and across the first year of parenthood. Research questions addressed whether change in the division of housework and childcare across the transition to parenthood predicted mothers' and fathers' relationship conflict, with attention to the mediating role of perceived fairness of these chores. Findings for housework indicated that perceived fairness was related to relationship conflict for mothers and fathers, such that when spouses perceived the change in the division of household tasks to be unfair to either partner, they reported more conflict, However, fairness did not significantly mediate relations between changes in division of household tasks and later relationship conflict. For childcare, fairness mediated relations between mothers' violated expectations concerning the division of childcare and later conflict such that mothers reported less conflict when they perceived the division of childcare as less unfair to themselves; there was no relationship for fathers.

In contrast, family economic structure has little effect on women' and men's level of family satisfaction, although we find a significant reduction in family satisfaction among couples who have recently shifted towards a more equal-earner economic structure. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both husbands' and wives' attitudes towards work and career in understanding how ""gender is done"" in couples, and in addressing the resulting family and work relations and dynamics.

Results indicate the existence of spatial variations as well as gaps in women's empowerment. The parsimonious regression results show that age, educational attainment, income from handloom activities, and government support have had positive influences. Engagement in the handloom activities improves intra-household power relations significantly in favor of women and thereby reduces preference for males and domestic violence.

Employer organisations successfully prevented the most relevant features from being implemented in the reformed law.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings of this research indicate that there is a need for more research on the tripartite policy process and its implication on developing policy.Social implicationsThis paper shows what kind of power employer and employee organisations use in Finnish policy making. As a result, the reformed gender equality legislation is a compromise reflecting the vested interests of different stakeholders.

"The Price Mothers Pay, Even When They Are Not Buying It: Mental Health Consequences of Idealized Motherhood","Henderson, Angie; Harmon, Sandra; Newman, Harmony","Drawing on previous work on the relationship between intensive mothering ideologies and mental health outcomes, the present study analyzed the relationship between the pressure to be the perfect mother and psychological well-being for modern mothers. Specifically, this study suggests that even women who do not subscribe to these ideologies are at-risk for experiencing increased stress and anxiety, and decreased self-efficacy in the face of the pressure to be perfect and guilt for not living up to high mothering expectations. The sample for this study was recruited using a snowball sampling technique via e-mail and an online survey instrument. The final sample included 283 mothers aged 18–50 mostly from the West (45 %) and Midwest (29 %) regions of the U.S., but also including the South (18 %) and Northeast (8 %). Hierarchical linear regression results indicate that mothers who experience the pressure to be perfect experience lower self-efficacy and higher levels of stress. Mothers who experience guilt for not meeting parenting expectations also experience lower self-efficacy, higher levels of stress and higher levels of anxiety. Contrary to prior research, intensive mothering beliefs were not a significant predictor of poorer mental health. The results from this study indicate that internalizing guilt and the pressure to be the perfect mother are detrimental for mothers regardless of whether or not they subscribe to intensive motherhood ideologies. This study also emphasizes the importance of framing motherhood with a feminist sociological lens to critique the dominant ideologies of motherhood and the detrimental effects on women.",2016,,Sex Roles,74,11-12,512-526,1938926943,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0534-5,,#1107,Henderson 2016,"",""

Altered stress patterns and increased risk for postpartum depression among low-income pregnant women,"Scheyer, Kathryn; Urizar, Guido G","Postpartum depression (PPD) has been associated with a number of negative maternal and infant health outcomes.

The current study examined whether the timing of altered salivary cortisol patterns and perceived stress levels during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum was associated with PPD symptoms among 100 low-income mothers. Higher levels of PPD were found among women with a lower cortisol awakening response (first and second trimester), lower average daily cortisol (second trimester), a flatter diurnal cortisol pattern (second and third trimester and at 3 months postpartum), and a less abrupt drop in both cortisol and perceived stress from the third trimester to 3 months postpartum.

Comparison of Poverty and Income Disparity of Single Mothers and Fathers Across Three Decades: 1990-2010,"Kramer, Karen Z; Myhra, Laurelle L; Zuiker, Virginia S; Bauer, Jean W","As the potential for more children being raised by single parents increases, so does the societal need to examine this phenomena of single parent earnings and the impact it will have on the ability to support a family above the poverty line. Research suggests a substantial pay gap between men and women, but most research is limited to individuals in traditional families. This study explores income disparity and poverty between single mothers and single fathers across three decades (1990-2010), using a US nationally representative sample. Based on human capital theory, our analysis reveals that single mothers were more likely to be in poverty at far greater rates than single fathers, after controlling for a host of demographic, human capital, and work related variables. We also found that a contributing factor to this disparity is that single mothers were penalized for having more children while single fathers were not.

New York's response provides a starting point to consider how governments should respond to wage theft as it affects undocumented women. There are various legal regimes available for responding to wage theft, but each presents serious shortcomings when it intersects with the immigration system, primarily because of the threat of retaliation. As federal protections are weak or exacerbate the victimization of undocumented women, states should strengthen anti-retaliation protections specific to undocumented workers. California passed legislation in this area which New York should adopt. While the protections provided in California 's legislation would strengthen each of the various legal regimes discussed, they would also empower undocumented women to break the silence imposed by retaliation and tell narratives that resist victimization.",2016,,Columbia Journal of Gender and the Law,32,1,96-144,1822926924,,,#1113,Taykhman 2016,"",""

It proceeds by describing who engages in the practice and why, while comparing Russia with its cultural and linguistic neighbors, Ukraine and Belarus. A survey, which was answered by a representative sample (n = 678) from the cities of Moscow, Kyiv, and Minsk, indicates that CD reception rates are comparable to elsewhere in the world. Moreover, while these cities have similar CD rates, there are important inter-city differences in the characteristics that make people more or less likely to take part. CD reception is linked to status in Kyiv and Moscow but is more closely tied to economic survival in Minsk. Moreover, while Kyiv and Moscow CD reception is affected by the importance of instrumental economic logic within relationships, there is no indication that other relationship values, such as love, have suffered as a result.

Findings – Justice perceptions of employees are based on: uniformity of implementation, bias suppression with respect to the right to fair pay, reliability of information on job content, relevance of job evaluation criteria, qualifications and impartiality of the pay equity committee members and the quality of employees’ representation and process transparency. Research limitations/implications – This study was conducted at a single workplace and among relatively highly educated respondents.

Working from home and the gender gap in earnings for self-employed US Millennials,"Simon, Jessica; Megan McDonald Way","Purpose – This paper aims to explore gender differences in terms of self-employment for US Millennials, relating them to working from home as well as other factors. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a population-based survey, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, which allows to compare home-based vs non-home-based self-employed women and men on a wide variety of characteristics. Descriptive analyses reveal the unconditional relationships between the covariates of interest, and the authors use ordinary least squares regression to reveal the conditional correlations between working from home and earnings for both women and men. Findings – The authors find that working from home is highly negatively correlated with earnings for women, but not for men, and that working from home may trump the other characteristics typically associated with lower earnings. Research limitations/implications – The regression subsample is relatively small (n = 245), leading to omitted variable bias in the regression. The “working-from-home” variable is potentially endogenous. The small sample size does not allow the authors to use detailed information on the self-employment industry. Future research should focus on finding larger samples and a way to instrument for working from home.

Increasing trends of syphilis among men who have sex with men in high income countries,"Read, Phillip; Fairley, Christopher K; Chow, Eric P F","Background: The epidemiology of syphilis, and therefore the population most impacted, differs between countries. Many developed countries have reported an increase in syphilis notifications among men who have sex with men (MSM) over the past decade. Methods: The rates of syphilis notifications between 2000 and 2013 in the 31 countries categorised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as high income were investigated. Data was taken primarily from published national surveillance reports, and a male-to-female ratio substantially greater than two in syphilis notifications was taken as a proxy for the infection being disproportionately diagnosed in MSM. Results: Data was available for 27 high-income countries. The male-to-female ratio exceeded two in all but four countries. This ratio significantly increased across all geographical areas over time. Globally, the male-to-female ratio in these countries increased from 4.1 in 2000 to 7.9 in 2013 (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the proportion of male cases reported as being among MSM increased over time from 26.8% to 55.0% between 2000 and 2013 (P < 0.001).

"The Magnifying Effect of Privilege: Earnings Inequalities at the Intersection of Gender, Race, and Nativity","Nawyn, Stephanie J; Gjokaj, Linda","Feminist concerns about the epistemological problems of quantitative methods have resulted in an underdevelopment of quantitative approaches that could contribute to existing intersectional theory. Further, feminist scholars commonly consider the effects of gender as it intersects with race or class, but relatively little of this research has included nativity (being either an immigrant or native-born to a society). This article addresses these shortcomings by examining patterns of earnings inequality at the intersection of gender, race, and nativity, comparing cohorts of African-born Black and white immigrants to their US-born counterparts over multiple time-points. Further, the depressive effects of gender are large enough so that while there are differences in women's earnings across race and nativity, nearly all groups of men still earn more than nearly all groups of women. The article's results demonstrate that privilege has a magnifying effect, with the advantages conferred from one privileged status increasing the effects of other privilege statuses, which become larger over time.

Using path analysis, we tested the following hypotheses: self-assessed physical attractiveness would be more strongly associated with self-perceived mating success among women than men, whereas self-assessed earning capability would be more strongly linked to self-perceived mating success among men than women (H1); relative physical attractiveness, as compared to their partners', would be more strongly associated with men's rather than women's self-perceived investment size, whereas relative earning capability would be more strongly related to women's rather than men's investment size (H2); for both men and women, self-perceived mating success would be positively associated with sense of power, whereas self-perceived investment size would be negatively associated with sense of power (H3). Results indicated that self-perceived physical attractiveness and earning capability were associated with self-perceived mating success similarly for both men and women, failing to support H1.

In India, a high prevalence of mental health disorders has been recorded in young women, but there has been little research to examine the factors that affect their mental health at home and work.Methods: Through a primarily qualitative approach, we studied the relationship between work, caring for family, spousal support, stress relief strategies and mental health amongst forty eight low-income working mothers residing in urban slums across Bangalore, India. Participants were construction workers, domestic workers, factory workers and fruit and vegetable street vendors. Qualitative data analysis themes included state of mental health, factors that affected mental health positively or negatively, manifestations and consequences of stress and depression, and stress mitigators.Results: Even in our small sample of women, we found evidence of extreme depression, including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Women who have an alcoholic and/or abusive husband, experience intimate partner violence, are raising children with special needs, and lack adequate support for child care appear to be more susceptible to severe and prolonged periods of depression and suicide attempts. Factors that pointed towards reduced anxiety and depression were social support from family, friends and colleagues and fulfilment from work.Conclusion: This qualitative study raises concerns that low-income working mothers in urban areas in India are at high risk for depression, and identifies common factors that create and mitigate stress in this population group. We discuss implications of the findings for supporting the mental health of urban working women in the Indian context. The development of the national mental health policy in India and its subsequent implementation should draw on existing research documenting factors associated with negative mental health amongst specific population groups in order to ensure greater impact.",2014,,BMC Women's Health,14,,,1497963853; 24502531,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-14-22,,#1130,Travasso 2014,"",""
