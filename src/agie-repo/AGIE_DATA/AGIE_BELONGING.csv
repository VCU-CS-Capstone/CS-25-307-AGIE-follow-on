Gender Stereotypes and Peer Selection in STEM Domains Among Children and Adolescents.,McGuire L; Hoffman AJ; Mulvey KL; Hartstone-Rose A; Winterbottom M; Joy A; Law F; Balkwill F; Burns KP; Butler L; Drews M; Fields G; Smith H; Rutland A,"Gender stereotypes are harmful for girls' enrollment and performance in science and mathematics. So far, less is known about children's and adolescents' stereotypes regarding technology and engineering. In the current study, participants' (N = 1,206, girls n = 623; 5-17-years-old, M = 8.63, SD = 2.81) gender stereotypes for each of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) domains were assessed along with the relation between these stereotypes and a peer selection task in a STEM context. Participants reported beliefs that boys are usually more skilled than are girls in the domains of engineering and technology; however, participants did not report gender differences in ability/performance in science and mathematics. Responses to the stereotype measures in favor of one's in-group were greater for younger participants than older participants for both boys and girls. Perceptions that boys are usually better than girls at science were related to a greater likelihood of selecting a boy for help with a science question. These findings document the importance of domain specificity, even within STEM, in attempts to measure and challenge gender stereotypes in childhood and adolescence.",2022,,Sex Roles,87,9-10,455-470,,10.1007/s11199-022-01327-9,36447747,#1,McGuire 2022,"",""
Weight Stigma and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Axis Reactivity in Individuals Who Are Overweight.,McCleary-Gaddy AT; Miller CT; Grover KW; Hodge JJ; Major B,"BACKGROUND: Stigmatized people exhibit blunted cortisol responses to many stressors. PURPOSE: To examine the cortisol responses of individuals who are overweight to a stigma-related stressor involving interviewing for a weight-discriminatory company. METHODS: We recruited 170 men and women (mean age = 35.01) from towns located within about a 30-min drive of the study center. Weight was assessed using body mass index (BMI) and self-perceptions about being overweight. Participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor, modeled after the Trier Social Stress Test. In the stigmatizing condition, participants gave a supposedly videotaped speech about what makes them a good candidate for a job at a company that was described as having a weight-discriminatory health insurance benefit. Participants in the nonstigmatizing condition made a supposedly audiotaped speech for a company whose health insurance benefit was not described. Cortisol reactivity was then assessed. RESULTS: Participants who rated themselves as overweight or who were overweight according to their BMI evidenced a blunted cortisol response in the weight-stigmatizing condition, whereas lean participants in the weight-stigmatizing condition showed the rise in cortisol levels that typically occurs following the Trier Social Stress Test. CONCLUSIONS: People who experience the chronic stress of being stigmatized due to their weight show blunted cortisol responses just as other chronically stressed people do.",2019,Mar,Ann Behav Med,53,4,392-398,,10.1093/abm/kay042,29917036,#2,McCleary-Gaddy 2019,"",""
A Leak in the Academic Pipeline: Identity and Health Among Postdoctoral Women.,Ysseldyk R; Greenaway KH; Hassinger E; Zutrauen S; Lintz J; Bhatia MP; Frye M; Starkenburg E; Tai V,"Several challenges (e.g., sexism, parental leave, the glass ceiling, etc.) disproportionately affect women in academia (and beyond), and thus perpetuate the leaky pipeline metaphor for women who opt-out of an academic career. Although this pattern can be seen at all levels of the academic hierarchy, a critical time for women facing such challenges is during the postdoctoral stage, when personal life transitions and professional ambitions collide. Using a social identity approach, we explore factors affecting the mental health of postdoctoral women, including identity development (e.g., as a mother, a scientist) and lack of control (uncertainty about one's future personal and professional prospects), which likely contribute to the leak from academia. In this mixed-method research, Study 1 comprised interviews with postdoctoral women in North America (n = 13) and Europe (n = 8) across a range disciplines (e.g., psychology, physics, political science). Common themes included the negative impact of career uncertainty, gender-based challenges (especially sexism and maternity leave), and work-life balance on mental and physical health. However, interviewees also described attempts to overcome gender inequality and institutional barriers by drawing on support networks. Study 2 comprised an online survey of postdoctoral women (N = 146) from a range of countries and academic disciplines to assess the relationships between social identification (e.g., disciplinary, gender, social group), perceived control (i.e., over work and life), and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction). Postdoctoral women showed mild levels of stress and depression, and were only slightly satisfied with life. They also showed only moderate levels of perceived control over one's life and work. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that strongly identifying with one's discipline was most consistently positively associated with both perceived control and mental health. Collectively, these findings implicate the postdoctoral stage as being stressful and tenuous for women regardless of academic background or nationality. They also highlight the importance of disciplinary identity as a potentially protective factor for mental health that, in turn, may diminish the rate at which postdoctoral women leak from the academic pipeline.",2019,,Front Psychol,10,,1297,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01297,31231285,#3,Ysseldyk 2019,"",""
Sources of Male and Female Students' Belonging Uncertainty in the Computer Sciences.,Höhne E; Zander L,"Belonging uncertainty, defined as the general concern about the quality of one's social relationships in an academic setting, has been found to be an important determinant of academic achievement, and persistence. However, to date, only little research investigated the sources of belonging uncertainty. To address this research gap, we examined three potential sources of belonging uncertainty in a sample of undergraduate computer science students in Germany (N = 449) and focused on (a) perceived affective and academic exclusion by fellow students, (b) domain-specific academic self-efficacy beliefs, and (c) perception of one's individual performance potential compared to that of fellow students in the field. Perceived affective and academic exclusion by fellow students and domain-specific academic self-efficacy beliefs were significant predictors of female students' uncertainty about belonging in computer science. The perception of one's individual performance potential in comparison to that of fellow students, however, was a relevant predictor of both male and female students' belonging uncertainty in computer science. Our findings imply an expanded view of the theoretical concept of belonging uncertainty that goes beyond mere concerns of social connectedness.",2019,,Front Psychol,10,,1740,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01740,31456707,#4,Höhne 2019,"",""
"Threats to Belonging, Immune Function, and Eating Behavior: an Examination of Sex and Gender Differences.",Jaremka LM; Lebed O; Sunami N,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The first goal of this review is to discuss the evidence linking belonging threats to immune function and food intake. The second goal is to evaluate whether the links among belonging threats, immune function, and eating behavior differ based on gender. RECENT FINDINGS: Threats to belonging are linked to elevated herpesvirus antibody titers, dysregulated appetite-relevant hormones, and increased food consumption. Furthermore, these relationships are largely consistent for both men and women. Threats to belonging are also linked to elevated inflammation. However, some studies showed that these effects were stronger among women, others demonstrated that they were stronger among men, and others determined that the links were consistent for men and women. Understanding why belonging threats are inconsistently linked to inflammation across men and women is an important next step.

Institutional Culture of Belonging and Attrition Risk Among Women Health Care Professionals.,Schaechter JD; Starr JR; Silver JK,"Objective: Attrition of women health care professionals is high, threatening patient care and advances in health care sciences. Women health care professionals have often reported experiencing challenges in the workplace that lower their sense of belonging and may precipitate their attrition. The current study sought to identify dimensions of workplace belonging in women health care professionals and to determine the relative strength of association of these belonging dimensions with intent to leave (ITL) their institution. Methods: Attendees of a continuing education course on women's leadership skills in health care were surveyed about their ITL and workplace belonging experiences. Dimensions of workplace belonging were identified by factor analysis. The strength of association between ITL and each workplace belonging dimension, as well as their relative strengths of association, were assessed in ordinal regression analyses. Results: Women comprised 99% of survey participants. Three dimensions of workplace belonging were identified: ""institutional culture,"" ""interactions with supervisor,"" and ""interpersonal relationships."" More frequent experiences of support in any of the three belonging dimensions associated strongly with lower ITL. When all three belonging dimensions were considered simultaneously, ITL remained strongly related with experiences of a supportive ""institutional culture"" (odds ratio 0.41, p < 0.0001), while it became much less strongly related with supportive experiences in the other two dimensions. Conclusions: These findings suggest a dominant role of institutional culture in attrition risk in women health care professionals. Interventions that foster an institutional culture of diversity, opportunities for career advancement, and inclusivity might be effective in improving retention of women health care professionals.",2024,Dec,J Womens Health (Larchmt),33,12,1645-1655,,10.1089/jwh.2024.0321,39311809,#6,Schaechter 2024,"",""
"Unpacking the Social Constructs of Discrimination, Othering, and Belonging in Medical Schools.",Anjorin O; Busari JO,"ISSUE: Triggered by the lived experiences of the authors-one junior career, female, and black; the other senior career, male, and black-we provide a critical, sociological overview of the plight of racial/ethnic minority students in medical education. We analyze the concepts of categorization, othering, and belonging in medical education, which we use to shed light on the psychological and academic consequences of overgeneralizing social categories. EVIDENCE: The ability to categorize people into different social groups is a natural, subconscious phenomenon. Creating social groups is believed to aid people in navigating the world. This permits people to relate to others based on assumed opinions and actions. Race and gender are two primary dimensions of categorization, with race or ethnicity being a particularly salient category. However, over-generalization of social categories can lead the categorizer to think, judge, and treat themselves and members of a perceived group similarly, leading to prejudice and stereotyping. Social categorization also occurs in educational settings across the globe. The consequences of categorization may influence a student's feelings of belonging and academic success. IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis reflects on how to promote equitable opportunities for ethnic minority medical trainees through the lens of those who have experienced and succeeded in an inequitable system. By revisiting the social and psychological constructs that determine and influence the academic progress and success of minority students in medical education, we discovered that more engagement is (still) needed for critical discourse on this topic. We expect such conversations to help generate new insights to improve inclusion and equity in our educational systems.",2024,Oct-Dec,Teach Learn Med,36,5,660-668,,10.1080/10401334.2023.2230211,37424255,#7,Anjorin 2024,"",""
"Tools for Discussing Identity and Privilege Among Medical Students, Trainees, and Faculty.",Chow CJ; Case GA; Matias CE,"INTRODUCTION: Physicians and students of all backgrounds should be prepared to interact with patients of various socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, gender, religious, and sexual orientation identities. The approach described here emphasizes how important it is for physicians and physicians-in-training to develop self-awareness before engaging with patients. METHODS: Over the course of 6 months, we conducted workshops on identity awareness for four groups: (1) fourth-year medical students (N = 6), (2) first-year medical students (N = 88), (3) faculty and staff (N = 11), and (4) residents/fellows (N = 4). Exercises in this workshop prompted learners to reflect on the development of social and professional identities through the use of an identity wheel activity, a group reading about professional identity formation, and a hands-on activity modeling social inequity. RESULTS: Our analysis of responses to pre- and postsurveys indicated that learners in the first-year medical student group (N = 88) experienced increased awareness and acknowledgment of social identity, professional identity, professional relationships, and the concepts of privilege and difference following participation in this workshop. DISCUSSION: These exercises guide learners toward critical thinking about privilege and identity to better prepare them for culturally inclusive patient interactions. These materials can be used with physicians at various levels of training. The earlier they are used, the more time learners will have to reflect on social and professional identities before interacting with patients.",2019,Dec,MedEdPORTAL,15,,10864,,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10864,32051847,#8,Chow 2019,"",""
Changing Social Contexts to Foster Equity in College Science Courses: An Ecological-Belonging Intervention.,Binning KR; Kaufmann N; McGreevy EM; Fotuhi O; Chen S; Marshman E; Kalender ZY; Limeri LB; Betancur L; Singh C,"In diverse classrooms, stereotypes are often ""in the air,"" which can interfere with learning and performance among stigmatized students. Two studies designed to foster equity in college science classrooms (Ns = 1,215 and 607) tested an intervention to establish social norms that make stereotypes irrelevant in the classroom. At the beginning of the term, classrooms assigned to an ecological-belonging intervention engaged in discussion with peers around the message that social and academic adversity is normative and that students generally overcome such adversity. Compared with business-as-usual controls, intervention students had higher attendance, course grades, and 1-year college persistence. The intervention was especially impactful among historically underperforming students, as it improved course grades for ethnic minorities in introductory biology and for women in introductory physics. Regardless of demographics, attendance in the intervention classroom predicted higher cumulative grade point averages 2 to 4 years later. The results illustrate the viability of an ecological approach to fostering equity and unlocking student potential.",2020,Sep,Psychol Sci,31,9,1059-1070,,10.1177/0956797620929984,32845825,#9,Binning 2020,"",""
"Beliefs in ""Brilliance"" and Belonging Uncertainty in Male and Female STEM Students.",Deiglmayr A; Stern E; Schubert R,"A wide-spread stereotype that influences women's paths into STEM (or non-STEM) fields is the implicit association of science and mathematics with ""male"" and with requiring high levels of male-associated ""brilliance."" Recent research on such ""field-specific ability beliefs"" has shown that a high emphasis on brilliance in a specific field goes along with a low share of female students among its graduates. A possible mediating mechanisms between cultural expectations and stereotypes on the one hand, and women's underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields on the other hand, is that women may be more likely than men to feel that they do not belong in these fields. In the present study, we investigated field-specific ability beliefs as well as belonging uncertainty in a sample of n = 1294 male and female university students from five STEM fields (Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering) at a prestigious technical university in Switzerland. Field-specific ability beliefs of both men and women emphasized brilliance more in more math-intensive fields (Mathematics, Physics) than in less math-intensive fields (Engineering). Women showed higher beliefs in brilliance than men did, and also reported higher levels of belonging uncertainty. For both genders, there was a small, positive correlation (r = 0.19) of belief in brilliance and belonging uncertainty. A relatively small, but significant portion of the effect of gender on belonging uncertainty was mediated by women's higher belief in brilliance.",2019,,Front Psychol,10,,1114,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01114,31191382,#10,Deiglmayr 2019,"",""
Subliminal Gender Stereotypes: Who Can Resist?,van Breen JA; Spears R; Kuppens T; de Lemus S,"We examine women's responses to subliminal gender stereotypes, that is, stereotypes present outside conscious awareness. Previous research suggests that subtle stereotypes elicit acceptance and assimilation, but we predict that subliminal exposure to gender stereotypes will trigger resistance in some women. Specifically, we expect resistance to occur among women who are relatively strongly identified with feminists, but not with the broader group of women. We predict that resistance takes the form of persistence in stereotypically masculine domains and (implicit) in-group bias. Indeed, we found that subliminal exposure to stereotypes (vs. counter-stereotypes) led women who identify relatively strongly with feminists, but less strongly with women, to (a) persist in a math task, (b) show increased willingness to sacrifice men in a Moral Choice Dilemma task, and (c) show implicit in-group bias on an evaluative priming task.

Race and gender differences in how sense of belonging influences decisions to major in STEM.,Rainey K; Dancy M; Mickelson R; Stearns E; Moller S,"BACKGROUND: Women and students of color are widely underrepresented in most STEM fields. In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed 201 college seniors, primarily women and people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here we discuss one section of the longer interview that focused on students' sense of belonging, which has been found to be related to retention. In our analysis, we examine the intersections of race and gender with students' sense of belonging, a topic largely absent from the current literature. RESULTS: We found that white men were most likely to report a sense of belonging whereas women of color were the least likely. Further, we found that representation within one's STEM sub-discipline, namely biology versus the physical sciences, impacts sense of belonging for women. Four key factors were found to contribute to sense of belonging for all students interviewed: interpersonal relationships, perceived competence, personal interest, and science identity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that students who remain in STEM majors report a greater sense of belonging than those who leave STEM. Additionally, we found that students from underrepresented groups are less likely to feel they belong. These findings highlight structural and cultural features of universities, as well as STEM curricula and pedagogy, that continue to privilege white males.",2018,,Int J STEM Educ,5,1,10,,10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6,30631700,#12,Rainey 2018,"",""
I am done with this! Women dropping out of engineering majors.,González-Pérez S; Martínez-Martínez M; Rey-Paredes V; Cifre E,"Women are still underrepresented in STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). One of the possible drivers behind this gender gap in the labour market is the female dropout from STEM education. The causes of the gender differences in the persistence of pursuing STEM studies have been explained by multiple factors related to interest and resolution in this type of career. The goal of the present research is to study the Engineering persistence gender gap in higher education by exploring the main factors underlying the leakage in the pipeline of Engineering fields. Our study reports the results of 34 qualitative in-depth interviews where internal barriers, stereotypes and external obstacles are assessed by women who have left their university degrees, compared with men who have withdrawn and women who have persisted. Results from the content analysis suggest that the undermining of persistence in Engineering fields is related to factors such as the chilly and hostile environment in classes or the workload from an excessively demanding curriculum. Other factors affecting women's withdrawal are the lack of role models and the perceived incongruity between the female gender role and STEM roles in society, leading to a weakening of female students' self-efficacy and eroding their sense of belongingness, even making them consider dropping out of their Engineering degree. These findings provide information for the design of future STEM interventions aimed to enhance women's persistence in STEM university studies.",2022,,Front Psychol,13,,918439,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439,36033057,#13,González-Pérez 2022,"",""
Negotiating Identity and Belonging in a New Space: Opportunities and Experiences of African Youths in South Australia.,Mude W; Mwanri L,"This paper was part of a large study that aimed to explore determinants of increased suicides among African youths in South Australia. As part of this larger study, narratives from participants indicated that identity crisis could be a potential determinant of suicide. This paper reports on how African youths negotiate and form identity in Australia. A qualitative inquiry was undertaken with 31 African youths using a focus group and individual interviews. Data analysis was guided by a framework for qualitative research. These youths negotiated multiple identities, including those of race, gender, ethnicity and their origin. 'Freedom and opportunity', 'family relationships', 'neither belonging here nor there' and 'the ability to cope against the paradox of resourcefulness in Australia' appeared to be important themes in negotiating individual identities. An opportunity was used to acknowledge privileges available in Australia relative to Africa. However, the extent to which individuals acted on these opportunities varied, affecting a person's sense of purpose, identity formation and belonging in Australia. The loss of social networks following migration, and cultural differences between African and Australian societies, shaped the experience of belonging and identity formation. These findings are crucial as they indicate the need for policies and practices that consider experiences of youths as they form their identity in Australia. Further studies with large numbers of participants are needed to explore these issues further among African youths in Australia.",2020,Jul,Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,15,,,10.3390/ijerph17155484,32751346,#14,Mude 2020,"",""
The longitudinal effects of STEM identity and gender on flourishing and achievement in college physics.,Seyranian V; Madva A; Duong N; Abramzon N; Tibbetts Y; Harackiewicz JM,"BACKGROUND: Drawing on social identity theory and positive psychology, this study investigated women's responses to the social environment of physics classrooms. It also investigated STEM identity and gender disparities on academic achievement and flourishing in an undergraduate introductory physics course for STEM majors. One hundred sixty undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physics course were administered a baseline survey with self-report measures on course belonging, physics identification, flourishing, and demographics at the beginning of the course and a post-survey at the end of the academic term. Students also completed force concept inventories, and physics course grades were obtained from the registrar. RESULTS: Women reported less course belonging and less physics identification than men. Physics identification and grades evidenced a longitudinal bidirectional relationship for all students (regardless of gender) such that when controlling for baseline physics knowledge: (a) students with higher physics identification were more likely to earn higher grades; and (b) students with higher grades evidenced more physics identification at the end of the term. Men scored higher on the force concept inventory than women; although no gender disparities emerged for course grades. For women, higher physics (versus lower) identification was associated with more positive changes in flourishing over the course of the term. High-identifying men showed the opposite pattern: negative change in flourishing was more strongly associated with high identifiers than low identifiers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study underlines gender disparities in physics both in terms of belonging and physics knowledge. It suggests that strong STEM identity may be associated with academic performance and flourishing in undergraduate physics courses at the end of the term, particularly for women.

Structure and belonging: Pathways to success for underrepresented minority and women PhD students in STEM fields.,Fisher AJ; Mendoza-Denton R; Patt C; Young I; Eppig A; Garrell RL; Rees DC; Nelson TW; Richards MA,"The advancement of underrepresented minority and women PhD students to elite postdoctoral and faculty positions in the STEM fields continues to lag that of majority males, despite decades of efforts to mitigate bias and increase opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. In 2015, the National Science Foundation Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NSF AGEP) California Alliance (Berkeley, Caltech, Stanford, UCLA) conducted a wide-ranging survey of graduate students across the mathematical, physical, engineering, and computer sciences in order to identify levers to improve the success of PhD students, and, in time, improve diversity in STEM leadership positions, especially the professoriate. The survey data were interpreted via path analysis, a method that identifies significant relationships, both direct and indirect, among various factors and outcomes of interest. We investigated two important outcomes: publication rates, which largely determine a new PhD student's competitiveness in the academic marketplace, and subjective well-being. Women and minority students who perceived that they were well-prepared for their graduate courses and accepted by their colleagues (faculty and fellow students), and who experienced well-articulated and structured PhD programs, were most likely to publish at rates comparable to their male majority peers. Women PhD students experienced significantly higher levels of distress than their male peers, both majority and minority, while both women and minority student distress levels were mitigated by clearly-articulated expectations, perceiving that they were well-prepared for graduate level courses, and feeling accepted by their colleagues. It is unclear whether higher levels of distress in women students is related directly to their experiences in their STEM PhD programs. The findings suggest that mitigating factors that negatively affect diversity should not, in principle, require the investment of large resources, but rather requires attention to the local culture and structure of individual STEM PhD programs.",2019,,PLoS One,14,1,e0209279,,10.1371/journal.pone.0209279,30625173,#16,Fisher 2019,"",""
Theories for Race and Gender Differences in Management of Social Identity-Related Stressors: a Systematic Review.,Bey GS; Ulbricht CM; Person SD,"Sociodemographic group-specific strategies for stress management may contribute to racial and gender disparities in health outcomes in the USA. We aimed to systematically review theoretical and empirical investigations of factors influencing variation in response to and management of identity-related stress among black and white Americans. OvidPsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Criteria were participant age of ≥ 18 years, conducted in the US sampling black or white participants, and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. The final sample included 167 articles. Theories suggesting social status inequities as the primary contributor to disparate strategies employed by black and white women and men to manage social identity-related stress were most frequently tested and supported. Studies disproportionally focused on how women and black persons cope as targets of prejudice and discrimination rather than on how management strategies of men or white persons are affected as perpetrators. Finally, there was theoretical support for an interactive effect of race and gender on stress management, but empirical evidence was lacking, particularly among black men, white women, and white men. The literature could be strengthened through the use of prospective cohorts and nationally representative samples, as well as study designs accounting for potential within-race and within-gender variation in the effects of social identity-related stressors on coping.

Building an inclusive wave in marine science: Sense of belonging and Society for Women in Marine Science symposia.,Canfield KN; Sterling AR; Hernández CM; Chu SN; Edwards BR; Fontaine DN; Freese JM; Giroux MS; Jones AE; McCarty AJ; Morrissette HK; Palevsky HI; Raker CE; Robuck AR; Serrato Marks G; Thibodeau PS; Windle AE,"Achieving gender equity is a long-standing and ubiquitous challenge in marine science. Creating equitable experiences for all genders in marine science requires recognizing scientists' intersectional identities, and how this leads to unique lived experiences of privilege and marginalization. One approach to increase equitable experiences for women in marine science is to create affinity groups where women can learn from each other, share their experiences, and provide support and mentorship. The Society for Women in Marine Science (SWMS) is one such organization, founded to amplify the work of early career women in marine science and create community, through events such as full-day symposium events. This study investigates the experiences of symposium attendees for four events held from 2018 through 2020, as reported in pre- and post-symposium surveys. We used quantitative analysis of the open-ended survey questions to examine the demographics of attendees and their fields of study. Qualitative thematic analysis identified the most effective aspects of the symposia, areas of logistical and content improvement for future symposia, and emphasized the unique challenges women in marine science experience. The majority of symposium attendees were white graduate students. Nearly all attendees identified as women, with a small number of men and non-binary individuals. Symposia attendees enjoyed opportunities for professional development and interactions with colleagues across career stages. We present recommendations for continuing to foster a sense of belonging in marine science and STEM more broadly, both specific to SWMS and transferable actions that can be applied for other affinity groups. These suggestions include empathetic event logistics, continual democratic evaluation, identity reflexivity among group leaders, and professional development activities targeted towards the unique needs of the affinity group.

Violence victimisation and young adult cardiometabolic health: the role of timing and social identity.,Koning SM; Aronoff J; Chen S; Hargrove T; Polos J; McDade TW,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent violence victimisation is associated with a spectrum of adult social and behavioural health outcomes, including adverse mental health symptoms. However, underlying social stress mechanisms linking adolescent victimisation to adult cardiometabolic health remains poorly understood. AIM: The current study aims to reveal how adolescent and adult interpersonal violence exposures each get ""under the skin"" to affect adult metabolic syndrome, including direct victimisation and, additionally, witnessing violence. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We use a nationally representative longitudinal cohort, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, and leverage a quasi-experimental approach, propensity score matching regression analysis (n = 14,267). RESULTS: We find that adolescent violence exposure carries an enduring effect on young adult metabolic syndrome risk factor incidence and high-risk status, which is independent of young adult violence. Violence effects do not vary by sex or racial identity. CONCLUSION: In sum, adolescent exposure to direct interpersonal violence significantly affects young adult cardiometabolic health in ways suggesting adolescence is a sensitive period for the onset of harmful cardiometabolic effects in early adulthood.

"To Be Seen, Heard, and Valued: Strategies to Promote a Sense of Belonging for Women and Underrepresented in Medicine Physicians.",Haggins AN,"Lingering unconscious biases and daily cues continue to permeate and persist in academic medicine environments in the form of the exclusion of physicians who are women or racially/ethnically underrepresented in medicine. Academic medicine environments must change so that women and underrepresented in medicine racial/ethnic groups are seen, heard, and valued. A shared awareness among faculty, administrators, and trainees can inform the development of intentional strategies to alter individual behaviors, academic spaces, and institutional processes to cultivate a sense of belonging. Shifting the norms in medicine and the course of historical exclusion will require professional development in areas of inclusive teaching practices, skills to cultivate mentoring relationships with diverse trainees, and fostering discussions about the relevance of personal identity, as well as attention to the symbolism and imagery in institutional messages (e.g., portraits on the walls, website, marketing campaigns) and to the value of including community involvement in productivity metrics.",2020,Oct,Acad Med,95,10,1507-1510,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003553,32590469,#21,Haggins 2020,"",""
Equal Representation Does Not Mean Equal Opportunity: Women Academics Perceive a Thicker Glass Ceiling in Social and Behavioral Fields Than in the Natural Sciences and Economics.,van Veelen R; Derks B,"In the study of women in academia, the focus is often particularly on women's stark underrepresentation in the math-intensive fields of natural sciences, technology, and economics (NTE). In the non-math-intensive of fields life, social and behavioral (LSB) sciences, gender issues are seemingly less at stake because, on average, women are well-represented. However, in the current study, we demonstrate that equal gender representation in LSB disciplines does not guarantee women's equal opportunity to advance to full professorship-to the contrary. With a cross-sectional survey among N = 2,109 academics at mid-level careers (i.e., assistant and associate professors) in the Netherlands, we test the hypothesis that in LSB (more than NTE), female academics perceive to hit a ""thicker"" glass ceiling-that is, they see a sharper contrast between the high representation of women at the lower compared to the top levels. We test whether this predicts female academics' lower estimated chances to reach full professorship relative to men in LSB (but not NTE). We introduce a novel perceived glass ceiling index (GCI), calculated based on academics' perceptions of the share of women and men in their direct work environment minus their perceptions of gender ratio among full professors in their field. Results confirm that the perceived glass ceiling is thicker in the non-math-intensive LSB compared to math-intensive NTE fields. Furthermore, only in LSB (but not NTE), women perceived a thicker glass ceiling than men. Moreover, only among female academics, the thicker the perceived glass ceiling, the lower their estimated chances to become full professor 1 day. Combined, a moderated mediation showed that for women only, a thicker perceived glass ceiling in LSB compared to NTE disciplines predicted their lower estimated chances to advance to full professor level. No such mediation occurred for men. We conclude that women's higher numerical representation in LSB disciplines does not negate a male-dominant normative standard about academic leadership and success. Paradoxically, the perceived odds for female academics to reach the top of their field are lower in fields where they are relatively highly represented, and this may pose unique barriers to women's perceived opportunities for career success.",2022,,Front Psychol,13,,790211,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.790211,35369222,#22,vanVeelen 2022,"",""
Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of models of maternity care for women from migrant and refugee backgrounds in high-income countries: A systematic review.,Yeshitila YG; Gold L; Abimanyi-Ochom J; Riggs E; Tolossa T; Le HND,"BACKGROUND: Different models of care may be appropriate for various groups of women during their perinatal period, depending on their risk level, location, and accessibility of healthcare practitioners and facilities. Evaluating these models' effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is critical to allocating resources and offering sustained care to women from refugee backgrounds. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of maternity care models among women from migrant and refugee backgrounds living in high-income countries. METHODS: A comprehensive search of major databases for studies published in English between 2000 and 2023 was developed to identify literature using defined keywords and inclusion criteria. Two authors independently screened the search findings and the full texts of eligible studies. The quality of the included studies was appraised, and qualitative and quantitative results were synthesised narratively and presented in tabular form. The review was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: Forty-seven research papers from six countries were included in the review. The review highlighted the positive impact of community and stakeholders' involvement in the implementation of models of maternity care for women from migrant and refugee backgrounds. The review summarised the models of care in terms of their effectiveness in improving perinatal health outcomes and minimising medical interventions, continuum of care in maternity services, enhancing health literacy, maternity service use and navigating the healthcare system, social support, and sense of belongingness, and addressing cultural and linguistic barriers. Notably, only one study conducted a partial economic evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of the model. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: While the reviewed models demonstrated effectiveness in improving perinatal health outcomes, there was considerable variation in outcome measures and assessment tools across the models. Thus, reaching a consensus on prioritised perinatal outcomes and measurement tools is crucial. Researchers and policymakers should collaborate to enhance the quality and quantity of economic evaluations to support evidence-based decision-making. This includes thoroughly comparing costs and outcomes across various health models to determine the most efficient interventions. By emphasizing the importance of comprehensive economic evaluations, healthcare systems can better allocate resources, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient healthcare delivery.",2024,Oct,Soc Sci Med,358,,117250,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117250,39186841,#23,Yeshitila 2024,"",""

However, because most studies compare Black vs White patients, little is known about survival differences among members of racial and ethnic minority groups. OBJECTIVE: To describe differential survival and identify nonclinical factors associated with stage of presentation among patients with HNC belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the 2007 to 2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and included non-Hispanic Black, Asian Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic patients with HNC. The data were analyzed from December 2020 to May 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were time to event measures: (HNC-specific and all-cause mortality) and stage of presentation. Covariates included nonclinical (age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity, insurance status, marital status, and a composite socioeconomic status [SES]) and clinical factors (stage, cancer site, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery). A Cox regression model was used to adjust associations of covariates with the hazard of all-cause death, and a Fine and Gray competing risks proportional hazards model was used to estimate associations of covariates with the hazard of HNC-specific death. A proportional log odds ordinal logistic regression identified which nonclinical factors were associated with stage of presentation. RESULTS: There were 21 966 patients with HNC included in the study (mean [SD] age, 56.02 [11.16] years; 6072 women [27.6%]; 9229 [42.0%] non-Hispanic Black, 6893 [31.4%] Hispanic, 5342 [24.3%] Asian/Pacific Islander, and 502 [2.3%] American Indian/Alaska Native individuals). Black patients had highest proportion with very low SES (3482 [37.7%]) and the lowest crude 5-year overall survival (46%). After adjusting for covariates, Hispanic individuals had an 11% lower subdistribution hazard ratio (sdHR) of HNC-specific mortality (sdHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95), 15% lower risk for Asian/Pacific Islander individuals (sdHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93), and a trending lower risk for American Indian/Alaska Native individuals (sdHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.01), compared with non-Hispanic Black individuals. Race, sex, insurance, marital status, and SES were consistently associated with all-cause mortality, HNC-specific mortality, and stage of presentation, with non-Hispanic Black individuals faring worse compared with individuals of other racial and ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study that included only patients with HNC who were members of racial and ethnic minority groups, Black patients had significantly worse outcomes that were not completely explained by stage of presentation.

"Picturing the dance: intersections of gender, sexuality, and age in older women queer square dancers.",Walsh CA; Grittner AL,"A dearth of research has focused on the diverse experiences of aging sexual minority populations and, in particular, older sexual minority women. Studies that have disaggregated the population of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, queer, intersex and two-spirit (LGBTQIS+) older adults reveal that due to minority stress and a lifetime of disadvantage. Lesbians experience higher rates of chronic health conditions and mental health problems (including loneliness) than heterosexual women and greater financial inequalities compared to gay men or heterosexual women. Despite this, limited inquiry has explored the everyday lives of older queer women and fewer still draws upon women's commentary on their own lived experiences or centers older women as authoritative agents and experts on their own lives. In response to this knowledge deficit, this research traverses the aging experiences of female-identified members of a gay square dance (GSD) club in Toronto, Canada. We apply queer theory to explicate the unique ways in which a GSD club queers the aging process for 14 older women dancers. Findings of the inquiry highlight the ways in which these dancers confront and reject heteronormativity, while illuminating pathways to successful aging for older sexual diverse women. The older women dancers in this study perform gender in ways that challenged heteronormativity and gender binaries, enhanced belongingness and acceptance, embodied joy, and fostered wellness. These concepts have been identified as critical factors in successful aging and highlight what queering aging might look like for this resilient population who have overcome a lifetime of disadvantage.",2024,Sep-Oct,J Women Aging,36,5,382-397,,10.1080/08952841.2024.2347718,38738807,#25,Walsh 2024,"",""

The ecological-belonging intervention aimed to establish classroom norms that adversity in the course is normal and surmountable. In classrooms receiving the intervention, cross-gender interaction increased 51%, the gender gap in belonging was reduced by 47%, and higher classroom diversity was associated with higher course grades and 1-year grade point average for both men and women.

CONCLUSIONS: We showed that empathy levels were modulated by group belonging (25% of the variance was explained by group belonging). Post hoc analyses showed that the differences between the peers' and patients' situations tend to reveal an appropriate professional attitude with regard to patients because they displayed: (1) lower scores on personal distress and fantasy; (2) higher scores on perspective taking (as for peers); (3) stable scores on empathic concern in peers' and patients' situations.

Sense of belonging to physics significantly predicted value and success expectations for studying physics in college beyond what is predicted by interest and self-concept in physics. These findings suggest that sense of belonging is influenced by stereotype threat, which was shown to cause gender differences in science.

Benefits of belonging: experimental manipulation of social inclusion to enhance psychological and physiological health parameters.,Begen FM; Turner-Cobb JM,"OBJECTIVE: Acute changes in social belonging are important triggers for alterations in health and well-being, yet research has emphasised the negative effects of 'exclusion' at the expense of evaluating the potentially positive effects of 'inclusion'. This study examined the impact of acute belonging on physiological and psychological outcomes. DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A healthy population (N = 138) were randomly allocated to 'included' or 'excluded' conditions. Condition-dependent differences in pre/during-task heart rate and pre/post-task self-reports of negative/positive mood, and social self-esteem, were assessed. RESULTS: Included participants showed decreased heart rate and negative mood, and increased social self-esteem. No inclusion-related change in positive mood was shown. An increase in heart rate was observed in excluded participants though no changes in negative/positive mood or social self-esteem were shown. Shifts in social self-esteem acted as a mechanism through which inclusion/exclusion impacted upon negative and positive mood alterations. Results remained significant in presence of covariates (sex, global self-esteem, rumination and social anxiety). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that acting to enhance belonging through 'inclusion' resulted in adaptive physiological and psychological outcomes.

However, few studies explored the underlying mechanism between bullying and mathematics achievement. The purpose of this study was to explore the direct and indirect effects of school bullying on mathematics achievement among Chinese eighth grade students. METHODS: A two-stage stratified sample design was used to select participants. The participants were all eighth grade students from a city of southwest China and 17,527 adolescents (51.7% boys, M(age) = 13.34 ± 0.56 years) were included in this study. Students completed a battery of paper-and-pencil instruments concerning demographic information, school bullying, teacher-student relationships, sense of belonging, and mathematics achievement.

"Evaluation of an occupation-based, mental-health program: Meeting being, belonging and becoming needs.",Rebeiro Gruhl KL; Boucher M; Lacarte S,"INTRODUCTION: Being, belonging and becoming are important theoretical constructs for occupational scientists and therapists, and for members of Northern Initiative for Social Action (NISA), located in northern Ontario, Canada. Collaborative research with service users guided the development of NISA and its evaluation tool: the 3B~S Scale. The aim of this paper is to share the results of the 2018 program evaluation. METHODS: 113 participants completed a questionnaire consisting of the 3B~S Scale, demographic and program satisfaction questions, and open-ended questions. Quantitative analysis used descriptive statistics followed by ordinal logistic regression to determine the intersectional effects of gender, race and age on becoming and system impact outcomes. Open-ended responses were analysed thematically and triangulated with quantitative findings. RESULTS: Participants agreed-to-strongly agreed that the program met their 3B needs (x = 4.20, SD = 0.24). Participants indicated strong satisfaction with the program (x = 4.38, SD = 0.66), and agreement that participating in the program reduced their reliance on other system-based services (x = 3.96, SD = 0.24). The regression revealed no significant differences in gender, race or age in predicting six of 10 outcomes examined; race was not significant for any outcome. Younger females were more likely to agree that the work they do is part of a larger community charitable purpose, the program is helping them to achieve their goals, and is increasing their involvement in community. Younger participants were more likely to agree that participation facilitated a return to school or employment than older participants. CONCLUSIONS: Occupation-based, mental health programs that address participants' being, belonging and becoming needs can contribute to improvements in perceived mental health and well-being, as well as to improved community and system usage outcomes.

Low levels of school-belongingness strengthened the positive relationships between cyber victimization and Time 2 depression and anxiety, especially among Latinx adolescents. The positive association between cyber victimization and Time 2 loneliness was strengthened for low levels of school-belongingness for all adolescents.

We contribute to the belongingness literature through a mixed methods intersectional study of students attending a STEM-focused public university we call Meadow State University (MSU). We assess the potential for students' intersecting social identities to differentially influence their experiences with intersectional oppression-subjection to multiple systems of oppression due to simultaneous membership in more than one marginalized group-that, in turn, may influence their college pathways. In addition, we explore whether intersectional differences affect sense of belonging differently in STEM and non-STEM majors. We employ a mixed-methods approach, informed by critical quantitative methods and in-depth interviews. We utilize quantitative institutional data measuring college satisfaction, expressed as ""willingness to return"" to the same university, for over 3,000 students during two academic years (2013-14 and 2016-17). Survey data explores college satisfaction as an indicator of intersectional differences in student experiences. Then, we analyze 37 in-depth interviews, collected between 2014-2016 at the same institution, to further contextualize the intersectional variation suggested by survey results. RESULTS: Willingness to return is influenced by major, as well as academic, social, and campus belonging. Moreover, the extent to which these factors affected outcomes additionally varied by race/ethnicity, gender, family income, other background factors, and the ways these factors may intersect. Important components of academic belonging included faculty-student interactions, perceptions of academic support, and a privileging of STEM degree programs and students over non-STEM students and their degree programs at MSU. Faculty responsiveness and high impact practices like internships played an important role, particularly in STEM programs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that, particularly for students of color and those subject to intersectional oppression due to multiple marginalized identities, satisfaction with academics did not always outweigh deficiencies in other areas of campus life shaping belongingness. CONCLUSIONS: Our mixed-methods approach contributes insights into how and why students' background, individual choices, and institutional practices concurrently-and intersectionally-influence their ability to form a sense of belonging on campus. Structural changes are required to end practices that support intersecting systems of oppression by favoring White, upper-income men as the ""default"" STEM students in the U.S. Our research supports growing evidence that institutions must actively build models of inclusion for underrepresented and marginalized groups that address inequitable and unjust practices, providing transformative mentoring and educational guidance that attends to intersectional oppression, in order to effectively support the next generation of women and scholars of color.",2024,,PLoS One,19,1,e0296389,,10.1371/journal.pone.0296389,38198497,#34,Ovink 2024,"",""
Health Disparities Between Sexual Minority and Different-Sex-Attracted Adolescents: Quantifying the Intervening Role of Social Support and School Belonging.,Perales F; Campbell A,"Purpose: An emerging literature documents that sexual minority youth experience significantly and substantially worse health than their heterosexual peers, but few studies have examined the intervening mechanisms linking adolescents' sexual orientation to their health outcomes. This study hypothesized that social support from parents and friends and school belonging would act as important mediators of this relationship and is among the first to test this proposition empirically. Methods: The analyses used rich data from an Australian national probability sample of 14-15-year olds (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, n = 3204) and regression models to estimate the associations between sexual attraction and four high-quality indicators of adolescent health/well-being capturing health-related quality of life, socio-emotional functioning, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction. Mediation tests were subsequently performed to quantify the extent to which three scales capturing social support from parents and friends and school belonging mediated the relationships identified. Results: Sexual minority status, social support from parents and friends, and school belonging were significantly related to all health/well-being outcomes. Sexual minority adolescents reported significantly lower levels of support and belonging. Collectively, the support and belonging variables were responsible for 49%-70% of the associations between sexual minority status and the health/well-being outcomes, with school belonging being the most important mediator. Conclusion: These findings have important implications for health equity policy and practice.

Suicide-related cognitions and emotional bias performance in a community sample.,McManimen SL; Hay J; Long C; Bryan CJ; Aase DM,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is theorized to be connected to social interactions and feelings of belongingness. Those with suicide-related cognitions (SRCs) demonstrate attentional bias toward negative or suicide-related words, which can lead to increased feelings of rejection or alienation. As social interactions employ both verbal and nonverbal cues, there exists a gap in understanding how perception of emotional expressions can contribute to the development or exacerbation of suicidal ideation. METHODS: The current sample (N = 114, 60.5 % female, 74.6 % white) completed the Suicide Cognitions Scale-Revised (SCS-R) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess SRCs and depression severity. The Emotional Bias Task (EBT) was used to assess emotional response latency. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses on EBT results showed that endorsement of SRCs and depression severity were not associated with any particular emotional response bias. However, presence of SRCs showed an association with longer latencies to identify ambiguous emotional expressions, even when controlling for depressive symptoms and age LIMITATIONS: Measures were self-completed online. Relative homogeneity of the sample and cross-sectional design limits interpretation of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Those with more severe SRCs take longer to recognize positive, nonverbal cues. Irregular processing of positive emotional stimuli combined with bias toward negative verbal cues could worsen feelings of rejection or alienation in social interactions, therefore increasing risk of developing SI. This suggests that interventions focusing on allocation of attentional resources to process positive social cues may be beneficial for those with SRCs to reduce severity and risk of suicide.",2024,Mar,J Affect Disord,349,,197-200,,10.1016/j.jad.2024.01.005,38190852,#36,McManimen 2024,"",""
The interaction between personality and interpersonal needs in predicting suicide ideation.,Park Y; Kim HS,"The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (i.e., IPTS) proposes that suicidal desire occurs when an individual simultaneously experiences thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB) (i.e., interpersonal needs).

A variable was deemed significant if the P-value was ≤ 0.05. A total of 383 students (88% of total respondents) completed 50% or more of the inclusion questions. Seniors had the highest response rate. More students reported coming from a rural background. Primary species of interest was companion animals. There were no observed differences in feelings of inclusion in classes, with peers, or with faculty for hometown, admission type, ethnic group, and first generation when students started (P ≥ 0.067). There was a difference for primary species of interest (P ≤ 0.011) and with female students feeling less included (P ≤ 0.039). There were no observed differences after 2 yr in classes, with peers, or with faculty for classification year, admission type, or first generation (P ≥ 0.088). Suburban students felt the least included in classes compared to rural and urban students (P ≤ 0.036). Female students felt less included in all three categories (P ≤ 0.017). The majority of students reported having companion animal experience but almost half reported having no experience with livestock prior to ISU. A total of 51% of students said they never considered transferring to another major and 48% indicated that they plan to pursue a career in veterinary medicine. A total of 75% of students felt inclusion could be improved by creating more hands-on opportunities and 60% suggested the department provide more study space.

Navigating Social Relationships with Mentors and Peers: Comfort and Belonging among Men and Women in STEM Summer Research Programs.,Daniels HA; Grineski SE; Collins TW; Frederick AH,"Gender disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are well documented, yet little is known about how women and men students establish social relationships with research mentors and peers and how that shapes their experiences in STEM. We conducted a series of interviews with 17 undergraduate students from a Hispanic majority institution regarding their participation in STEM-focused summer research programs at nine universities. Differences in levels of comfort in relationships were present when comparing men and women. Women students expressed comfort in relationships with mentors who provided psychosocial mentoring, were available to answer questions, and were of the same gender; they expressed some social discomfort in informal interactions with mentors. Men students felt comfortable with mentors who provided limited guidance, little psychosocial mentoring, and opportunities for informal interactions. In terms of peer relationships, women sought out the confidence of a few similar peers, while men were comfortable with a wide variety of peers. Men's greater comfort with social relationships seemed to reflect their affinity with the masculine-dominated culture of STEM. For women, cultivating safe spaces through relationships with supportive peers and working with same-gender faculty mentors seemed to mitigate some of the discomforting aspects of their STEM research experiences.",2019,Jun,CBE Life Sci Educ,18,2,ar17,,10.1187/cbe.18-08-0150,31025915,#39,Daniels 2019,"",""
Examination of residency program websites for the use of gendered language and imagery.,Read CE; Tracz JA; Mhaimeed N; Mainville RN; Elzie CA,"BACKGROUND: Significant disparity in gender distribution exists among medical specialties. Residency program websites are a main source of preliminary program information for candidates, and website content may influence a prospective applicant's sense of belongingness within a particular program. Given the importance of the residency program website as a recruiting tool, this study sought to examine and compare the presence of gendered language and imagery on residency program websites across various specialties. METHODS: A list of words considered masculine or feminine was used to evaluate residency program websites of the two most male-dominated specialties (orthopedic and thoracic surgery), female-dominated specialties (pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology), and gender-balanced specialties (dermatology and family medicine) in the United States in 2022. Forty-five residency programs were randomly selected from each specialty across different regions of the US, with the exception of thoracic surgery of which there are only 33 programs. Masculine and feminine words were evaluated using a parsing and scraping program. Representation of female and male-presenting team members in photos on program websites was also evaluated. RESULTS: Masculine wording occurred more frequently in male-dominated specialties compared to gender-balanced (p = 0.0030), but not female-dominated specialties (p = 0.2199). Feminine language was used more frequently in female-dominated compared to male dominated fields (p = 0.0022), but not gender balanced (p = 0.0909). The ratio of masculine-to-feminine words used was significantly higher in male-dominated specialties compared to both gender-balanced (p < 0.0001) and female-dominated specialties. (p < 0.0001). There was an average of 1, 7, and 10 female-presenting residency team members pictured on each male-dominated, gender balanced, and female-dominated specialty RPW respectively, with significantly more female-presenting team members pictured in the photographs on female-dominated specialty websites when compared to male-dominated and gender-balanced specialty websites (p < 0.0001, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The use of gendered language and female representation in photographs varies significantly across specialties and is directly correlated with gender representation within the specialty. Given that students' perceptions of specialty programs may be affected by the use of language and photos on residency program websites, programs should carefully consider the language and pictures depicted on their program websites.",2023,Sep,BMC Med Educ,23,1,697,,10.1186/s12909-023-04677-4,37752546,#40,Read 2023,"",""
"Meta-lay theories of scientific potential drive underrepresented students' sense of belonging to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).",Rattan A; Savani K; Komarraju M; Morrison MM; Boggs C; Ambady N,"The current research investigates people's perceptions of others' lay theories (or mindsets), an understudied construct that we call meta-lay theories. Six studies examine whether underrepresented students' meta-lay theories influence their sense of belonging to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The studies tested whether underrepresented students who perceive their faculty as believing most students have high scientific aptitude (a universal metatheory) would report a stronger sense of belonging to STEM than those who think their faculty believe that not everyone has high scientific aptitude (a nonuniversal metatheory). Women PhD candidates in STEM fields who held universal rather than nonuniversal metatheories felt greater sense of belonging to their field, both when metatheories were measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2). Undergraduates who held more universal metatheories reported a higher sense of belonging to STEM (Studies 3 and 4) and earned higher final course grades (Study 3). Experimental manipulations depicting a professor communicating the universal lay theory eliminated the difference between African American and European American students' attraction to a STEM course (Study 5) and between women and men's sense of belonging to STEM (Study 6). Mini meta-analyses indicated that the universal metatheory increases underrepresented students' sense of belonging to STEM, reduces the extent of social identity threat they experience, and reduces their perception of faculty as endorsing stereotypes. Across different underrepresented groups, types of institutions, areas of STEM, and points in the STEM pipeline, students' metaperceptions of faculty's lay theories about scientific aptitude influence their sense of belonging to STEM.

Diversity under the microscope: Lessons for building belonging in interdisciplinary spaces from the Women in Imaging + Industry bootcamp.,Esbin M; Blackmon L,"As scientific projects and labs benefit from increasingly interdisciplinary expertise, students and trainees find themselves navigating a myriad of academic spaces, each with its own workplace culture and demographics. A clear example is the interdisciplinary field of optics and biological microscopy which bridges biology, physics and engineering. While Biology PhDs are now >50% women, men in physics and engineering fields still significantly outnumber women, resulting in an imbalance of gender representation among microscopists and other 'tool innovators' in the interdisciplinary field of biological microscopy and biomedical optics. In addition to the cultural and cognitive whiplash that results from disparate representation between fields such as Biology, Engineering, and Physics, indifference from institutional leaders to implement equity-focused initiatives further contributes to cultures of exclusion, rather than belonging, for women. Here we elaborate on the motivation, structure, and outcomes of building a specific affinity-based bootcamp as an intervention to create an inclusive, welcoming learning environment for women in optics. Considering the presence of nonbinary, trans and other gender minoritised scientists, we recognise that women are not the only gender group underrepresented in biological microscopy and biomedical optics; still, we focus our attention on women in this specific intervention to improve gender parity in biological microscopy and biomedical optics. We hope that these strategies exemplify concrete paths forward for increasing belonging in interdisciplinary fields, a key step towards improving and diversifying graduate education.",2024,Jul,J Microsc,295,1,6-13,,10.1111/jmi.13188,37116898,#42,Esbin 2024,"",""
"High pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational weight gain among women belonging to upper SES from Delhi, India.",Arora P; Aeri BT,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With increase in prevalence of obesity and an increasing trend in the birth of macrosomic infants, Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines pertaining to optimal gestational weight gain (GWG) required for positive pregnancy outcome were revised in 1990 and 2009. Since, in the Indian scenario, no recommendations exist for optimum GWG for obese (OB) and overweight (OW) women, we assessed the pattern of GWG w.r.t Institute of Medicine (IOM), 2009 among the subjects with different body mass index (BMI). STUDY DESIGN: Present data were a part of a longitudinal observational study wherein, 312 pregnant women (≤12th week of gestation) attending private antenatal clinics were followed till term and their weight was monitored regularly at pre-determined intervals i.e., 12th-14th, 18th-20th, 24th-26th, 30th-32nd, 36th + week of gestation and compared w.r.t IOM guidelines 2009.

Sex differences in the impact of secondhand harm from alcohol on student mental health and university sense of belonging.,Thompson K; Wood D; Davis MacNevin P,"PURPOSE: University students report high rates of secondhand harm from alcohol (i.e., harm from another person's drinking). The current study investigated the association between students' exposure to secondhand harm and student mental health and university sense of belonging. We also assessed whether students' sense of belonging mediated the association between secondhand harm and mental health and sex differences in these associations. METHODS: A total of 941 students (70% female) completed an online survey. Path analysis was employed to test our hypotheses. Secondhand harm was assessed across three dimensions; strains (e.g., having sleep/studies interrupted), threats (e.g., physical/sexual assault), and interpersonal harm (e.g., taking care of intoxicated friends). RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of participants reported secondhand harm exposure in the last 30 days. Interpersonal harm was the most common type of harm experienced by students. Strains were associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, threats were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and interpersonal harm predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Gender moderated these effects, such that only interpersonal harm was associated with men's mental health outcomes. Sense of belonging was associated with fewer mental health symptoms, and significantly mediated the effect of threats on anxiety, depression, and stress for females only, such that threat exposure was associated with reduced sense of belonging, which in turn increased anxiety, depression, and stress. CONCLUSION: This study supports the growing body of literature demonstrating the high prevalence of secondhand harm exposure among university students and the association of these experiences with poor student mental health. Furthermore, this research provides evidence that sense of belonging may be one mechanism that explains this association.",2019,Feb,Addict Behav,89,,57-64,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.09.012,30261482,#45,Thompson 2019,"",""
"Student Pedagogical Consultants: A Strategy for Increasing Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity, and a Sense of Belonging in Curricular Approaches in Physical Therapist Education.",Hayward LM; Golub-Victor AC; Cheerman H; Kiami S; Addison I; Bhattrai M; Wang S; Miroshnik E,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diversity within the physical therapy profession lags in comparison to the United States population. As the profession strives to diversify, faculty must pay attention to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI-B) in curricular approaches, including classroom materials, instruction, and assessment. With critical application, students from equity-deserving groups (EDGs) can provide unique perspectives to faculty about curricular approaches. Case study purposes were to 1) enable students from EDGs to partner with faculty, as student pedagogical consultants (SPCs), in 2 courses in a Doctor of Physical Therapy program to provide feedback on DEI-B efforts related to curricular approaches and 2) describe the outcomes of SPCs experience. CASE DESCRIPTION: Eight female students from EDGs partnered with 3 White, female, faculty members in 2 courses: pediatrics and neurorehabilitation. Two SPCs teams observed the classrooms, met with faculty, and administered two-minute papers to classmates to gather feedback on DEI-B curricular approaches. Faculty and student SPCs wrote reflective papers, postproject, documenting their experiences. OUTCOMES: Themes informed a conceptual framework describing SPCs: 1) motivation for engaging in partnership; 2) creation of a pedagogical partnership space to promote dialogue and problem-solve barriers to DEI-B; 3) deeper understanding of teaching; 4) transfer of learning from the SPC experience to future work locations; and 5) faculty modification of teaching.

Executive functioning skills are central to learning and navigating in the new context. Knowledge of how young migrants' executive functioning is associated with stressful factors and positive or potentially protective factors, could contribute to understanding and possibly finding ways to support these young learners.Objective: To investigate how potentially stressful and positive factors are associated with executive function skills.Method: In a secondary, explorative analysis of questionnaire responses from 1312 migrant students in secondary schools in five European countries, the associations of planning- and initiative executive function skills (PIS-EF) with stressful factors (e.g. emotional and behavioural problems, daily stress, discrimination) and positive factors (e.g. resilience, school belonging, social support) were analysed by linear regression. Furthermore, differences between male/female and refugee/non-refugee migrants were examined.Results: Positive factors accounted for almost one-fifth of the variance in the students' self-reported PIS-EF and stress factors only one-tenth. Resilience showed the strongest association with students' PIS-EF, followed by Prosocial behaviour and School belonging. Hyperactivity, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were negatively associated with PIS-EF. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were minimally associated with the investigated aspects of executive functions. Adjusted for other variables, no variables showed significant differences in the association with EF between males and females, and refugee and non-refugee migrant students.Conclusions: Positive factors were more strongly associated with executive functioning than stressful factors and could represent pathways to strengthen executive functioning.

Ensemble perception of emotion: Incidental effects of social identity.,Dobbs S; Weisbuch M,"Research in vision science suggests that people possess a perceptual mechanism-ensemble perception-which enables them to rapidly identify the characteristics of groups (e.g., emotion, sex-ratio, race-ratio). This work examined whether ensemble perceptions of groups are driven by the characteristics of group members whose behavior is most likely to impact the perceiver. Specifically, we predicted that more self-relevant group members would be weighted more heavily in ensemble perceptions than less self-relevant group members. Study 1 (n = 83) found that young adult participants' ensemble perceptions of emotion were biased in favor of more self-relevant (younger adult) group members' emotional expressions, compared to less self-relevant (older adult) group members' emotional expressions, and that these ensemble perceptions informed judgments of belonging in the group. Study 2 recruited older (n = 94) and younger (n = 97) adult participants and again found a general pattern of bias in favor of more self-relevant (younger adult) group members' emotional expressions in ensemble perceptions of emotion and that these ensemble perceptions informed evaluations of belonging in the group. Finally, Study 3 (n = 193) directly manipulated the self-relevance of older and younger adult group members and found that the extent of bias in ensemble perceptions of emotion depended on whether younger or older adults were made more self-relevant. Results suggest that incidental cues of social identity can bias ensemble perceptions of emotion and influence downstream judgments of belonging.

Factors Influencing High School Students' Interest in pSTEM.,Ito TA; McPherson E,"The transition from high school to college is an important choice point for the pursuit of physical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (pSTEM) career paths, with students in the United States switching from course selection that is proscribed by state graduation requirements in high school to choosing classes and paths of study more freely in college. Here two studies examine whether social factors identified to inhibit interest in pSTEM within college students similarly affect high school students, and in particular whether these factors could contribute to gender differences in interest in pursuing pSTEM. We find a lower sense of social and ability belonging and lower self-efficacy among female than male high school students pursuing pSTEM classes. In addition, for females but not males, social belonging significantly predicts intentions to continue to pursue pSTEM, highlighting the importance of considering whether low social belonging inhibits intentions to pursue pSTEM for female but not male students. We also find that perceptions of pSTEM fields as requiring innate brilliance more than hard work selectively discourage female students from intending to further pursue pSTEM. Together the studies highlight the potential impact of both subjective self-perceptions and perceptions about pSTEM fields on students' interest in pSTEM and further identify processes that may selectively dissuade high school females from pursuing pSTEM career paths relative to males.",2018,,Front Psychol,9,,1535,,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01535,30186207,#49,Ito 2018,"",""

Those from underrepresented groups have been less likely to access both healthcare services and higher education. Little is known about the experiences of underrepresented students during their undergraduate studies in osteopathy in the UK. The aim of this project was to explore awareness of cultural diversity and beliefs about patients from underrepresented groups in current osteopathic educational environments and evaluate students' preparedness to manage patients from diverse groups. The project also aimed to investigate the educational experiences of students from underrepresented backgrounds during their training and their opinions on changes that could support better levels of recruitment and achievement. The findings were discussed with stakeholders in interactive workshops with the aim to develop recommendations for action and change. METHODS: A transformative action research paradigm informed this mixed methods project. It included: 1/ a survey of students from all seven osteopathic educational providers in the UK using the Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale (MCHS); 2/ a series of focus groups with students from underrepresented groups (women, students with disabilities, students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and students identifying as LGBTQIA+); and 3/ a workshop forum to discuss findings. RESULTS: A total of 202 participants completed the MCHS and demographic questionnaire and seven focus groups were conducted. A model was developed to describe participants' training experiences comprising two main themes: institutional contextual obstacles (with four sub-themes) and underrepresented students' conceptual understanding of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI). Recommendations for change identified in the workshops were based on three topics: institutions, staff, and students. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm conclusions from other institutions that staff education is urgently needed to create and maintain equitable, inclusive environments in osteopathic educational institutions in the UK to support all students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.

Does Medical Students' Sense of Belonging Affect Their Interest in Orthopaedic Surgery Careers? A Qualitative Investigation.,Gerull KM; Parameswaran P; Jeffe DB; Salles A; Cipriano CA,"BACKGROUND: The concept of social belonging has been shown to be important for retention and student success in collegiate environments and general surgery training. However, this concept has never been explored in relation to medical students' impressions of orthopaedic surgery careers. QUESTION/PURPOSE: To investigate medical students' sense of belonging in orthopaedic surgery and how it affects their interest in pursuing orthopaedic surgery careers. METHODS: Medical students from four medical schools were invited to participate in telephone interviews aimed to investigate medical students' reasons for considering (or not considering) orthopaedic surgery as a future career. Students were selected using random sampling and theoretical sampling methods (selecting participants based on specific characteristics) to obtain a diversity of student perspectives across medical school year, gender, race, age, and interest in orthopaedics. Semistructured interviews with open-ended questions and face validity were used to minimize bias in the interview process. Analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology, a rigorous and well-established method for creating conceptual models based on qualitative data. The result seeks to be a data-driven (as opposed to hypothesis-driven) theory that provides perspective on human behavior. Interviews were conducted until the point of thematic saturation, defined as the point when no new ideas occur in subsequent interviews; this was achieved at 23 students (16 self-identified as women, 12 self-identified as underrepresented minorities). RESULTS: Medical students articulated stereotypes about orthopaedic surgeons, in particular, that they were white, male, and athletic. Students derived their sense of belonging in orthopaedic surgery from how closely their identities aligned with these stereotypes about the field. Students who felt a sense of belonging described themselves as being part of a cultural ""in-group,"" and students who did not feel a sense of belonging felt that they were in a cultural ""out-group."" Members of the in-group often reported that orthopaedic experiences further reinforced their positive identity alignment, which typically led to increased interest and continued engagement with the field. Conversely, students in the out-group reported that their exposures to orthopaedics further reinforced their lack of identity alignment, and this typically led to decreased interest and engagement. Many students in the out-group reported pursuing other specialties due to a lack of belonging within orthopaedics. CONCLUSION: Students derive their sense of belonging in orthopaedics based on how closely their identity aligns with stereotypes about the field. Importantly, there were gender and racial factors associated with orthopaedic stereotypes, and thus with belonging (self-identifying as the in-group). Moreover, out-group students tended not to choose orthopaedic surgery careers because of a lack of belonging in the specialty. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With knowledge of the factors that influence students' sense of belonging, academic orthopaedic departments can focus on interventions that may lead to a more diverse pool of medical students interested in orthopaedic surgery. These might include explicitly addressing stereotypes about orthopaedics and cultivating positive identity alignment for students from diverse backgrounds through targeted mentorship fostering partnerships with affinity organizations, and creating space to talk about barriers. Targeted interventions such as these are needed to interrupt the cycle of in-group and out-group formation that, in this small multicenter study, appeared to deter students with underrepresented identities from pursuing orthopaedic surgery careers.",2021,Oct,Clin Orthop Relat Res,479,10,2239-2252,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000001751,34081658,#52,Gerull 2021,"",""

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to investigate and compare the actual proportion of homozygosity or autozygosity in the genomes of progeny of four subtypes of first cousin mating in humans, using both pedigree and genomic measures for autosomes and sex chromosomes. METHODS: For this purpose, Illumina Global Screening Array-24 v1.0 BeadChip followed by cyto-ROH analysis through Illumina Genome Studio was used to characterise the homozygosity in five participants from North Indian state (Uttar Pradesh). PLINK v.1.9 software was used to estimate the genomic inbreeding coefficients viz. ROH-based inbreeding estimate (F(ROH)) and homozygous loci-based inbreeding estimate (F(HOM)). RESULTS: A total of 133 ROH segments were detected with maximum number and genomic coverage in Matrilateral Parallel (MP) type and minimum in outbred individual. ROH pattern revealed that MP type has a higher degree of homozygosity than other subtypes. The comparison of F(ROH), F(HOM), and pedigree-based inbreeding estimate (F(PED)) showed some difference in theoretical and realised proportion of homozygosity for sex-chromosomal loci but not for autosome for each type of consanguinity.

Evaluating Communication Training at AVMA COE-Accredited Institutions and the Need to Consider Diversity within Simulated Client Pools.,Soltero E; Villalobos CD; Englar RE; Graham Brett T,"The push for competency-based veterinary medical education by accrediting bodies has led to the inclusion of non-technical skills within curricula. Communication, self-awareness, and cultural humility are considered essential for post-graduate success. To facilitate skills development, veterinary educators have incorporated a variety of modalities including lecture, group discussions, virtual and peer-assisted learning, role play, video review of consultations, and simulated clients (SCs). The overarching goal is developing students into self-reflective practitioners through exposure to clinical scenarios that enhance and embody diversity. Decision making about case management is subject to stereotypes, bias, and assumptions. Racial and ethnic disparities reported in health care can adversely impact patient outcomes. This study was conducted to evaluate communication training and diversity among SC pools within veterinary colleges. A questionnaire was electronically disseminated to assistant/associate deans and/or directors of curriculum/education at 54 American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education-accredited or provisionally accredited colleges of veterinary medicine. Twenty-one institutions are represented within the data set. Participating institutions summarized their communication curricula: 18 (85.71%) used SCs.

The Importance of Social Belongingness and Self-Efficacy for Explaining Gender Differences in Interest in STEM and HEED Majors.,Tellhed U; Bäckström M; Björklund F,"Throughout the world, the labor market is clearly gender segregated. More research is needed to explain women's lower interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) majors and particularly to explain men's lower interest in HEED (Health care, Elementary Education, and the Domestic spheres) majors. We tested self-efficacy (competence beliefs) and social belongingness expectations (fitting in socially) as mediators of gender differences in interest in STEM and HEED majors in a representative sample of 1327 Swedish high school students. Gender differences in interest in STEM majors strongly related to women's lower self-efficacy for STEM careers and, to a lesser degree, to women's lower social belongingness expectations with students in STEM majors. Social belongingness expectations also partly explained men's lower interest in HEED majors, but self-efficacy was not an important mediator of gender differences in interest in HEED. These results imply that interventions designed to lessen gender segregation in the labor market need to focus more on the social belongingness of students in the gender minority. Further, to specifically increase women's interest in STEM majors, we need to counteract gender stereotypical competence beliefs and assure women that they have what it takes to handle STEM careers.",2017,,Sex Roles,77,1,86-96,,10.1007/s11199-016-0694-y,28725103,#55,Tellhed 2017,"",""
"Belonging, happiness, freedom and empowerment-a qualitative study of patients' understanding of health in early rheumatoid arthritis.",Landgren E; Mogard E; Bremander A; Lindqvist E; Nylander M; Larsson I,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory joint disease, that influences patients' health in different ways, including physical, social, emotional, and psychological aspects. The goal of rheumatology care is to achieve optimal health and personalised care and therefore, it is essential to understand what health means for patients in the early course of RA. The aim of this study was to describe the understanding of health among patients with early RA. METHODS: The study had a descriptive qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Phenomenography is used to analyse, describe, and understand various ways people understand or experience a phenomenon, in this study, patients' understandings of health. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 patients (22 women and nine men, aged (38-80) with early RA, defined as a disease duration of < 1 year, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for 3-7 months. The phenomenographic analysis was conducted in 7 steps, and the outcome space presents the variation in understanding and the interrelation among categories. In accordance with the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology's (EULAR) recommendations, a patient research partner participated in all phases of the study. RESULTS: The analysis revealed four main descriptive categories: 'Health as belonging' was described as experiencing a sense of coherence. 'Health as happiness' was understood as feeling joy in everyday life. 'Health as freedom' was understood as feeling independent. 'Health as empowerment' was understood as feeling capable. Essential health aspects in early RA are comprised of a sense of coherence, joy, independence, and the capability to manage everyday life. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that patients' perception of health in early RA encompasses various facets, including a sense of belonging, happiness, freedom, and empowerment. It highlighted that health is multifaceted and personal, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging this diversity in providing person-centred care. The findings can guide healthcare professionals to deepen patients' participation in treatment goals, which may lead to better treatment adherence and health outcomes.",2024,Jun,BMC Rheumatol,8,1,29,,10.1186/s41927-024-00399-2,38937849,#56,Landgren 2024,"",""
A prospective examination of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior among psychiatric adolescent inpatients.,Czyz EK; Berona J; King CA,"The challenge of identifying suicide risk in adolescents, and particularly among high-risk subgroups such as adolescent inpatients, calls for further study of models of suicidal behavior that could meaningfully aid in the prediction of risk. This study examined how well the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behavior (IPTS)--with its constructs of thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), and an acquired capability (AC) for lethal self-injury--predicts suicide attempts among adolescents (N = 376) 3 and 12 months after hospitalization. The three-way interaction between PB, TB, and AC, defined as a history of multiple suicide attempts, was not significant. However, there were significant 2-way interaction effects, which varied by sex: girls with low AC and increasing TB, and boys with high AC and increasing PB, were more likely to attempt suicide at 3 months. Only high AC predicted 12-month attempts. Results suggest gender-specific associations between theory components and attempts. The time-limited effects of these associations point to TB and PB being dynamic and modifiable in high-risk populations, whereas the effects of AC are more lasting. The study also fills an important gap in existing research by examining IPTS prospectively.",2015,Apr,Suicide Life Threat Behav,45,2,243-59,,10.1111/sltb.12125,25263410,#57,Czyz 2015,"",""
I am one of you! Team prototypicality as a facilitator for female leaders.,Hernandez Bark AS; Monzani L; van Dick R,"In the present study, we complement role congruity theory with insights from the Social Identity Model of Leadership. We propose that especially female leaders benefit from team prototypicality, i.e., being representative of the group they are leading. We assume that team prototypicality shifts the comparative frame away from higher-order categories like gender and leader roles to more concrete team-related properties and thereby reduces disadvantages for female leader that stem from the incongruity between the leader role and the female gender role stereotypes. Further, this effect should affect both (female) leaders themselves and their perception by their followers. Building on previous research, we predict, first, lower authentic leadership behavior for female than male leaders. Second, that team prototypicality positively relates to authentic leadership and trust in leader. Third, that team prototypicality has stronger relations to authentic leadership and trust in leader for female compared to male leaders. We tested assumptions in a randomized online experiment (Study 1, N = 315) and a cross-sectional survey study (Study 2, N = 300). We did not find consistent support for the assumed gender differences in authentic leadership. But our results (both in manifest and in latent analyses) show that team prototypicality-both self-perceived (Study 1) and as perceived by employees (Study 2)-is related to more authentic leadership and more trust in leader (Study 2) and that these relations are stronger for female than for male leaders. Furthermore, we tested in Study 2 an extended model including follower's job satisfaction as the final follower outcome affected via team prototypicality, leader gender, authentic leadership, and trust in leader. Thereby, we found that team prototypicality has direct and indirect effects on job satisfaction as carried through authentic leadership and trust in leader, respectively. Together, the results of both studies support our assumptions and show that female leaders can reduce role incongruity barriers through high team prototypicality. Implications for future research and practical implications of these results for gender equality are discussed.",2022,,Front Psychol,13,,859577,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.859577,36337497,#58,HernandezBark 2022,"",""
Stereotype Threat in Virtual Learning Environments: Effects of Avatar Gender and Sexist Behavior on Women's Math Learning Outcomes.,Chang F; Luo M; Walton G; Aguilar L; Bailenson J,"Women in math, science, and engineering (MSE) often face stereotype threat: they fear that their performance in MSE will confirm an existing negative stereotype-that women are bad at math-which in turn may impair their learning and performance in math. This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners' avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Specifically, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) × 2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our findings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women's learning outcomes in virtual classrooms.

Discrimination faced by radiology residents: an analysis of experiences and mitigation strategies.,Camargo A; Radmard M; Dabiri M; Carson KA; Hsu L; Yousem DM,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Literature shows that discrimination has been pervasive in the field of medicine. The aim of this study was to collect experiences related to discrimination among US radiology residents, including type and source, as well as the residents' perception on lectures about discrimination and harassment. We also explored the barriers to reporting, and suggested strategies to overcome them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, an online survey was sent to program directors and coordinators across the US, who were asked to forward the link to their radiology residents. A reminder email was sent over a period of 4 months. The participants were reassured the survey was confidential and anonymous. RESULTS: Among the respondents, the most reported types of discrimination were based in gender, race and nationality, the majority of which not being reported. The most common perpetrators were attending radiologists, co-residents, technologists, and patients. The main barriers for reporting were fear of retaliation, confidentiality concerns, and skepticism about a positive outcome. CONCLUSION: Our study examines some experiences of discrimination shared by residents during their training, with gender and race being the most common causes. This sheds light into a hidden and unspoken issue and highlights the need for more active discussions in radiology on microaggressions and implicit bias.

Investigation of the sense of school belonging and sportspersonship behavior of students playing traditional children's games.,Temel A; Mamak H; Kangalgil M; Kılıçer İ; Erdem C; Çapar T; Özkan A; Uz S,"The purpose of this study is to examine the sense of school belonging and sportspersonship behaviors of students who participate in traditional children's games. The research was designed using a quasi-experimental model with a pre-test and post-test control group and was conducted over a period of 16 weeks. The study group consisted of a total of 1871 students, including 1379 middle school and 492 high school students, continuing their education in Eskil, Aksaray during the 2023-2024 academic year. The experimental group students participated in the games and inter-school tournaments within the scope of the ""2nd I Live My Values with Traditional Games Project"" No intervention was applied to the control group after the introduction of the games. The ""School Belongingness Scale"" and the ""Physical Education Course Sportspersonship Behavior Scale"" were used as data collection tools. For data analysis, MANOVA, paired samples t-test, and regression analysis were employed. The findings of the study indicated that both the experimental and control groups showed positive scores in pre-test and post-test measures of school belongingness and sportspersonship behaviors. However, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in their sense of school belonging and sportspersonship behaviors in favor of the post-test. While no significant change was observed in the control group's sense of school belonging, a decline was noted in their sportspersonship behaviors. The experimental group exhibited greater development in school belongingness and sportspersonship behaviors compared to the control group. Although middle school students showed improvements in their sense of school belonging, high school students experienced a more substantial emotional development. No significant differences were found in school belongingness and sportspersonship behaviors based on the students' gender. Sportspersonship behavior predicted school belongingness by 11%, suggesting that positive sportspersonship behaviors increased school attachment among children. In conclusion, it was determined that students participating in traditional children's games developed a more positive sense of school belonging and sportspersonship behaviors over time.

Disparities in positive mental health of sexual and gender minority adults in Canada.,Hajo S; Capaldi CA; Liu L,"INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study was to examine potential disparities in positive mental health (PMH) among adults in Canada by sexual orientation and gender modality. METHODS: Using 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Annual Component data (N = 57 034), we compared mean life satisfaction and the prevalence of high self-rated mental health (SRMH), happiness and community belonging between heterosexual and sexual minority adults, and between cisgender and gender minority adults. We used 2019 CCHS Rapid Response on PMH data (N = 11 486) to compare the prevalence of high psychological well-being between heterosexual and sexual minority adults. Linear and logistic regression analyses examined the between-group differences in mean life satisfaction and the other PMH outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Sexual minority (vs. heterosexual) adults reported lower mean life satisfaction (B = -0.7, 95% CI: -0.8, -0.5) and were less likely to report high SRMH (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.5), happiness (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.5), community belonging (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.7) and psychological well-being (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.6). Differences were not always significant for specific sexual minority groups in sexstratified analyses. Gender minority adults reported lower mean life satisfaction and were less likely to report high SRMH and happiness than cisgender adults.

Key language markers of depression on social media depend on race.,Rai S; Stade EC; Giorgi S; Francisco A; Ungar LH; Curtis B; Guntuku SC,"Depression has robust natural language correlates and can increasingly be measured in language using predictive models. However, despite evidence that language use varies as a function of individual demographic features (e.g., age, gender), previous work has not systematically examined whether and how depression's association with language varies by race. We examine how race moderates the relationship between language features (i.e., first-person pronouns and negative emotions) from social media posts and self-reported depression, in a matched sample of Black and White English speakers in the United States. Our findings reveal moderating effects of race: While depression severity predicts I-usage in White individuals, it does not in Black individuals. White individuals use more belongingness and self-deprecation-related negative emotions. Machine learning models trained on similar amounts of data to predict depression severity performed poorly when tested on Black individuals, even when they were trained exclusively using the language of Black individuals. In contrast, analogous models tested on White individuals performed relatively well.

This study examines the relationship between adolescent LD and adult depressive symptoms, with a focus on gender differences and underlying mechanisms. Using a sibling sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 3,414), this study estimated sibling fixed effects models to account for unobserved family-level characteristics such as genes and early childhood family and social context. Sobel mediation analyses were conducted to examine social-psychological mechanisms, including the student-teacher relationship, the student-student relationship, and a sense of school belonging. LD in adolescence was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adulthood (b = 0.823, p < 0.05). This association remained robust when controlling for unobserved family-level confounders as well as educational attainment in adulthood. Gender-stratified models showed that only the association for women is statistically significant (b = 1.935, p < 0.05), and its magnitude is nearly three times that of the association for men. Sobel mediation tests indicate that a decline in a sense of school belonging mediates approximately 17% of the association between adolescent LD and adult depressive symptoms. This study's findings suggest that LD in adolescence is associated with an increase in depressive symptoms in adulthood, particularly in women, and a low sense of school belonging may be a potential mediator.

YT, a kind of omnivorous fish, has strong resistance. TC, a kind of carnivorous fish, has high-quality meat but poor resistance. Distant hybridization can integrate the advantages of both parents. There has been no previous report regarding hybrid fish derived from female YT × male TC. It is expected that hybridization of these two kinds of fish will result in F(1) hybrids with improved characteristics, such as faster growth rate, stronger resistance, and high-quality meat, which are of great significance in fish genetic breeding. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the main biological characteristics of diploid hybrid fish derived from female YT × male TC. The hybrids had an intermediate number of upper lateral line scales between those for YT and TC. The hybrids were diploids with 48 chromosomes and had the same karyotype formula as their parents. The hybrids generated variations in 5S rDNA (designated class IV: 212 bp) and lost specific 5S rDNA derived from the maternal parent (designated class II: 221 bp), which might be related to hybridization. In terms of reproductive traits, all the tested female hybrids exhibited normal gonadal development, and the two-year-old F(1) females produced mature eggs. However, all the tested testes of the male hybrids could not produce mature sperm. It is possible that the hybrid lineage will be established by back-crossing the fertile female hybrids and their parents.

"'Gonna make yer gorgeous': Everyday transformation, resistance and belonging in the care-based hair salon.",Ward R; Campbell S; Keady J,"This paper makes a contribution to an emerging debate on dementia and citizenship through a focus on the everyday experiences of women living with dementia and in receipt of care. In particular, a link is drawn between hairdressing and citizenship in the context of dementia care. Informed by a wider debate over the importance of an emplaced, embodied and performative approach to citizenship, the authors highlight the way that intersecting forms of resistance unfold in the salon. The Hair and Care project, as the name implies, focused upon hair care and styling in the context of a wider consideration of appearance and how it is managed and what it means for people living with dementia. With a focus upon the routine, mundane and thereby often unproblematised aspects of everyday life in/with care, the discussion draws together two key ideas concerned with the interplay of power and resistance: Essed's (1991) theory of 'everyday discrimination' and Scott's (1985) notion of 'everyday resistance'.

Provocative work experiences predict the acquired capability for suicide in physicians.,Fink-Miller EL,"The interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS) offers a potential means to explain suicide in physicians. The IPTS posits three necessary and sufficient precursors to death by suicide: thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability. The present study sought to examine whether provocative work experiences unique to physicians (e.g., placing sutures, withdrawing life support) would predict levels of acquired capability, while controlling for gender and painful and provocative experiences outside the work environment. Data were obtained from 376 of 7723 recruited physicians. Study measures included the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale, the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, the Painful and Provocative Events Scale, and the Life Events Scale-Medical Doctors Version. Painful and provocative events outside of work predicted acquired capability (β=0.23, t=3.82, p<0.001, f(2)=0.09) as did provocative work experiences (β=0.12, t=2.05, p<0.05, f(2)=0.07).

Inequitable Changes in School Connectedness During the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic in a Cohort of Canadian Adolescents.,Patte KA; Gohari MR; Faulkner G; Bélanger RE; Leatherdale ST,"BACKGROUND: We examined whether subgroups of adolescents experienced disparate changes in school connectedness-a robust predictor of multiple health outcomes-from before the COVID-19 pandemic to the first full school year following pandemic onset. METHODS: We used 2 waves of prospective survey data from 7178 students attending 41 Canadian secondary schools that participated during the 2019-2020 (T1; pre-COVID-19 onset) and 2020-2021 (T2; ongoing pandemic) school years. Fixed effects analyses tested differences in school connectedness changes by gender, race, bullying victimization, socioeconomic position, and school learning mode. RESULTS: Relatively greater declines in school connectedness were reported by students that identified as females, were bullied, perceived their family to be less financially comfortable than their classmates, and attended schools in lower income areas. Marginally greater school connectedness declines resulted among students attending schools that were fully online at T2 than those at schools using a blended model. CONCLUSION: Results point to disparate school connectedness declines during the pandemic, which may exacerbate pre-existing health inequities by gender and socioeconomic position, and among bullied youth. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY, PRACTICE, AND EQUITY: Effective strategies to improve school climates for equity denied groups are critical for pandemic recovery and preparedness for future related events.",2024,Jun,J Sch Health,94,6,509-518,,10.1111/josh.13443,38373417,#74,Patte 2024,"",""

Current Workforce Status of the Neurosurgery Societies Belonging to the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies: A Survey of the Presidents of These Neurosurgery Societies.,Soriano Sánchez JA; Perilla Cepeda TA; Birrium Borba LA; Soto García ME; Israel Romero Rangel JA,"BACKGROUND: The Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC) is a nongovernmental, nonprofit civil association, founded to promote neurosurgery in the Latin American countries. The American College of Surgeons and American Association of Neurological Surgeons has recommended a ratio of 1 neurosurgeon/100,000 inhabitants. We aimed to estimate the neurosurgical workforce of the FLANC in 2020. METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey of the presidents of the societies of the FLANC to obtain the neurosurgical workforce characteristics and demographics in their countries. We coded and blindly analyzed the information for dispersion measures and graphics using SPSS, version 25, and Microsoft Excel for map density building. We obtained ratios for the number of neurosurgeons/100,000 inhabitants and the inverse ratio (the number of inhabitants/1 neurosurgeon). RESULTS: We obtained information from 19 countries. The population totaled 650,008,765 inhabitants. The workforce included 9100 neurosurgeons for a composite within the FLANC of 1.4 neurosurgeons/100,000 inhabitants. The mean ratio among individual countries was 1.17, with as many as 9 countries having a ratio of <1 neurosurgeon/100,000 inhabitants. The proportion of female neurosurgeons in the FLANC was 9.54%. Seven countries had no neurosurgeons in a range of subspecialty fields. CONCLUSIONS: The FLANC has significant disparities in neurosurgical workforce ratios among the member countries.

Although professional medical organizations' annual meetings play an instrumental role in continuing medical education for physicians, there are no studies describing DEI content in the annual meeting programming of professional medical organizations, including the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP), the primary professional organization for consultation-liaison psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: To examine the ACLP annual meeting titles using Content Analysis. METHODS: We examined the publicly available ACLP annual meeting content titles on the ACLP website from 2010 to 2021. National DEI leaders from ACLP's DEI subcommittee iteratively generated keywords that covered a broad scope of DEI-related themes. Each annual meeting's content was independently coded by 2 members of the DEI subcommittee with discrepancies adjudicated by 2 additional members. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the content of the annual meeting. RESULTS: Of the 2615 annual meeting titles from 2010 to 2021 that were analyzed, 2531 were not coded to have DEI themes. Three percent (n = 84) of titles were coded to have a DEI theme as follows: Culture/diversity (n = 20, 24%), bias/disparities (n = 17, 20%), race/racism (n = 17, 20%), social justice (n = 12, 14%), gender/sexism (n = 10, 12%), and LGBTQ+ (n = 8, 10%).

The purpose of this study was to identify prevalent health concerns among African American women who are members of The Links, Incorporated (Links), a large national service organization with health programming for communities of color. METHODS: Survey data (n = 391) were collected during the 2012 Links National Assembly. Twenty-six health issues were presented within five groups: cancer, CVD, pulmonary disease, chronic conditions, and behavioral health. For each issue, women indicated if it was a concern for ""you/your family"" or ""the African American community"" via check-boxes. Differences in the proportions for ""you/your family"" and ""the African American community"" were evaluated using the McNemar test. RESULTS: Hypertension was the most frequently endorsed concern for you/your family (79 %); 73 % indicated this was a concern for the African American community. Sickle cell anemia was the most frequently endorsed concern for the African American community (77 %). Melanoma was the least endorsed health issue overall (15 % you/your family, 55 % community).

Interactions between lifestyle and MTHFR polymorphisms on homocysteine concentrations in young adults belonging to the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort.,Oliveira IO; Silva LP; Borges MC; Cruz OM; Tessmann JW; Motta JV; Seixas FK; Horta BL; Gigante DP,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Homocysteine (Hcy) is a key intermediate in methionine metabolism. A high plasma concentration of Hcy is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases among other determinants. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interactions between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme gene (MTHFR) polymorphisms and lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity) on Hcy concentrations in a young Brazilian population. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study population comprised 3803 individuals from the Pelotas Birth Cohort, aged 22-23 years. Allelic discrimination assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays were performed for genotyping and serum Hcy measurements, respectively. Linear regression models were used to explore the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on Hcy concentrations. RESULTS: Men carrying the MTHFR 677TT genotype, who were also smokers and drinkers (⩾15 g of alcohol per day), had the highest concentration of Hcy (P-value for the interaction <0.001 for smoking and 0.002 for alcohol intake). In contrast, high folate concentrations attenuated the effects of the MTHFR C677T genotype on serum Hcy concentrations (P-value for interaction <0.001). Also, among males, blood folate concentration was the only lifestyle variable able to modify the influence of MTHFR A1298C genotypes on Hcy concentrations (P-value for the interaction <0.001). There was no strong evidence of an interaction between the MTHFR genotypes and the lifestyle variables in women. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study demonstrates a sex difference in Hcy concentrations among Brazilian young adults regarding MTHFR C677T-lifestyle interactions that are worsened under conditions of low blood folate.

Thus, the present study was carried out to determine the effects of Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles (Al-NPs) in rats. For this aim, different doses (0, 0.5, 5, 50 mg/kg b.w./day) of Al NP (˜40 nm) were orally administered to female rats (Rattus norvegicus var. albinus) for 14 days and the response of several biomarkers such as activities of ATPases (total ATPase, Na,K-ATPase, Mg-ATPase) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), levels of different glutathione forms and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in different tissues. Additionally, tissue accumulation of Al-NPs was demonstrated by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The images showed the presence of Al-NP aggregates in all the tissues at all doses. The sizes of NP aggregates were dependent on NP doses and it was a bit more loose in the brain than in the liver and kidney. AChE activity in the brain decreased significantly at all NP doses, whereas TBARS levels in the liver did not alter significantly at any NP dose. Although there was no significant change in ATPase activities in the intestine at any NP dose, there were significant decreases in the kidney and brain. There were some variations in the levels of total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (rGSH), though these variations were not significant (P > 0.05). Likewise, the ratio of rGSH/GSSG also did not differ significantly among NP doses and control. The brain seems most affected organ following Al-NP administration.

Impact of diversity representation in art on pre-health professions students' sense of belonging: A randomized experimental study.,Chugh N; Kim K; Kelly-Hedrick M; Chisolm MS; Balhara KS,"BACKGROUND: For learners underrepresented in medicine (UIM), a heightened sense of belonging may be critical to creating shared awareness of diversity and fostering an inclusive educational environment. Despite ongoing efforts from academic medical institutions to promote and retain diverse individuals, few studies have investigated the foundational role of pre-health professions education in shaping students' sense of belonging, and fewer still have leveraged the potential of arts- and humanities-based approaches in doing so. This study aimed to evaluate the perceived impact of race- and gender-diverse visual representations of health professionals on pre-health students' sense of belonging. METHODS: Twenty-eight pre-health professions students at one large undergraduate academic institution were randomized to one of two study groups. Each group participated in a visual arts-based workshop to discuss images depicting either gender- and race-diverse or non-diverse health professionals. All participants completed a pre- and post-workshop survey consisting of select items from the Professional Identity Questionnaire (PIQ), as well as an additional open-ended survey after viewing the images from the other study group. Changes in PIQ item scores were analyzed using chi-square statistics, and free-text survey responses underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although PIQ item score changes were not statistically significant in either group, both showed an overall directional increase that was more pronounced in the study group exposed to diverse images. Qualitative analysis of responses to open-ended survey items were grouped into four overarching themes: ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) converges with other aspects of intersectional identity,"" ""sense of belonging drives motivation,"" ""perceptions of medicine are shaped early in training,"" and ""cross-group exposure stimulates metacognitive thinking.""

Feminization of the precarious at the UNAM: examining obstacles to gender equality,Ciccia L.; ; Espinosa-Lugo G.; Garcia-Guzman G.; Gasca-Pineda J.; Velez P.; Espinosa-Asuar L.,"In this article we seek a better understanding of the specificities of the gender gap, regarding the reality of women in the different disciplines contained in STEM within Latin America. Specifically, we analyze and compare the situation of women in the Institutes of Mathematics, Ecology and Biology, belonging to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). In this novel study, we contribute to deepen in how the phenomena of horizontal and vertical segregation are combined with symbolic and structural obstacles, as well as economic-labor precariousness, within the framework of gender norms. We also analyze the points in common regarding the situation in the Global North. We consider that these facts are fundamental to understand how gender stereotypes are perpetuated in the production of knowledge, and what are the values implied in gender norms that explain the exclusion, and self-exclusion, of women in certain disciplines and statuses. Related to this, we inquired into the relationship between these values and the cultural capital represented in each of the disciplines mentioned and found that the knowledge areas that currently represent the highest cultural capital pose symbolic obstacles for women. Conversely, those areas that less strongly embody values associated with masculinity, and therefore have less cultural capital, present mainly structural obstacles for women.<ovid:br/>Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Gender equality eliminates gender gaps in engagement with female-stereotypic domains,Moss-Racusin C.A.; ; Rapp S.A.; Brown S.S.; O'Brien K.A.; Croft A.,"Although prior work reveals that gender bias against women produces gender gaps favoring men in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics engagement, research has yet to explore whether gender bias against men produces gender gaps favoring women in health care, early education, and domestic (HEED) engagement. Supporting preregistered predictions, results from an online study with MTurkers (N = 296) and a laboratory study with college students (N = 275) revealed that men expressed less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in HEED (and anticipated more discrimination) than did women when exposed to the reality of antimale gender biases in these domains. However, when told that HEED displays gender equality, men's engagement matched women's. Moderated mediation analyses revealed the importance of sense of belonging (and to a lesser extent, anticipated discrimination) in explaining why gender bias leads men to express less HEED positivity and aspirations than women. The current research thus provided novel evidence suggesting that gender bias contributes to men's underrepresentation in HEED, with important implications for broader occupational gender segregation.

Among the drugs approved for the treatment of obesity (Ob), liraglutide (a GLP-1 analogue) is among the most widely used and effective. Currently, however, there are still insufficient data on its effects on body composition (BC) changes during weight loss (WL) on gender difference. The aim of our study is to evaluate, therefore, any gender differences in the BC of subjects with obesity treated with liraglutide. 27 subject with Ob (11M; BMI 46.2Kg/m<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>), attending at Outpatients Clinic of the I.P. Diet Therapy in transplantation, renal failure and chronic pathology , University of Naples Federico II, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A (subjects treated for 3 months with hypocaloric diet, HD and liraglutide therapy); Group B (subjects treated for 3 months with HD). Anthropometric measurements s well as BC assessment were performed at baseline (T0) and after 3 months of treatment (T1). Conventional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) applied to any condition in which there is a violation of the assumption of constant tissue hydration (73%), such as Ob, propagates prediction errors. To solve these problems, the direct use of raw electrical data obtained from BIA analysis through bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) was proposed and employed in the study. At T1, the DELTABMI% in the two groups was not statistically significant (Group A 5.72% vs Group B 5.61% p > 0,05).

The impact of communal learning contexts on adolescent self-concept and achievement: Similarities and differences across race and gender,Dasgupta N.; ; Thiem K.C.; Coyne A.E.; Laws H.; Barbieri M.; Wells R.S.,"Misalignment between students' communal values and those expressed in classrooms is an obstacle to academic engagement, especially in mathematics, and especially for racial ethnic minority and female students. Using 10 schools across the United States, we conducted a longitudinal field study in 8th grade mathematics classes to investigate: (a) how perceptions of communally oriented classrooms influence student outcomes in early adolescence, (b) what psychological processes mediate these relations, and (c) whether the influence of perceived communal practices in classrooms have similar or different effects on students with varying social identities based on race, ethnicity, and gender. Results showed that middle school classes that emphasize communality (both social relevance of math and peer collaboration) significantly predicted stronger math self-concept, more behavioral engagement, and better performance in math. These associations were mediated through three psychological processes-belonging, challenge, and self-efficacy. Among racial ethnic minority adolescents, feelings of belonging and challenge in math class were key psychological processes that enhanced math learning outcomes. These processes were activated when classes connected communal values to math. Finally, communal learning contexts benefited girls and boys equally.

Gender inequality in academia: Problems and solutions for women faculty in STEM,Casad B.J.; ; Franks J.E.; Garasky C.E.; Kittleman M.M.; Roesler A.C.; Hall D.Y.; Petzel Z.W.,"Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender-biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., ""geeky"" decor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation-funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2021,/,Journal of Neuroscience Research,99,1,13EP  - 23,2007059475,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24631,33103281,#90,Casad 2021,"",""
The leaky pipeline of women in plastic surgery: Embracing diversity to close the gender disparity gap,Moak T.N.; ; Cress P.E.; Tenenbaum M.; Casas L.A.,"The Balance for Better campaign theme of the 2019 International Women's Day prompted a closer look at diversity within the plastic surgery specialty. Gender balance in the United States has improved through many organizational efforts and enactment of laws. Unfortunately, despite these endeavors, statistics show that men still enjoy greater financial and career success. Within the field of medicine, a similar trend has been observed. Although women constitute 50% of medical school graduates, the majority still enter fields outside of surgical subspecialties. In comparison to other surgical subspecialties, women are most represented in plastic surgery. Unfortunately, significant gender discrepancies remain in postgraduate practice including academic practice rank, societal board membership, invited speaker opportunities, and compensation, to name a few. The ""leaky pipeline""of women describes the precipitous decline in the numbers of women at each step up the professional ladder. We explore the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon and highlight factors that contribute to limiting female growth within the plastic surgery profession. We also emphasize the continued growth of female plastic surgeon presence in all sectors despite these existing obstacles. We submit that continued leadership, mentorship, and sponsorship provided by both male and female physicians in the field will facilitate future leadership, advance gender parity, and cultivate a sense of belonging within the plastic surgery community, allowing brilliant minds to flourish and the profession to thrive.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Aesthetic Society.

How do astrophysicists organize a party? Their wives planet: Gender differences in student perceptions of instructor humor in college science courses,Cooper K.; ; Hendrix T.; Cala J.; Brownell S.,"Instructor's use of humor in college classrooms is generally viewed positively by students and has been correlated with positive student learning, motivation, perceptions of instructor immediacy, and classroom environment. However, the majority of studies on instructor humor used in college classrooms have explored student perception of funny humor and not of unfunny or offensive humor. Female students, who are more likely to report feeling unwelcome in college science courses, may be particularly affected by instructor use of unfunny or offensive humor. However, few studies have explored how male and female students perceive instructor humor and more specifically, whether male and female students perceive different subjects as offensive. Further, no humor study has been conducted in the context of college science courses. This study was conducted as a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in biology education with 12 undergraduate and 4 graduate students. Students in the CURE engaged in the process of selecting a research question, iteratively developing a survey tool, collecting data, and analyzing data. We surveyed 1637 undergraduate students across 25 different college science courses at one institution and found that 97% of students appreciate when instructors use humor in college science classes. Using a combination of grounded theory and content analysis, we identified 12 distinct reasons for why students appreciate instructor use of humor in science classes, including that it enhances student learning, makes students more excited to attend class, and makes the instructor more approachable. We found that instructor use of funny humor positively impacted student sense-of-belonging to the science classroom, instructor relatability, and student attention to course content. We also found that while instructor use of unfunny humor appeared to neither have a positive nor a negative effect on students, instructor use of offensive humor negatively impacted student sense-of-belonging to the science classroom and instructor relatability. There was no difference in the extent to which instructor use of humor positively or negatively affected male and female students. Lastly, we identified a suite of subjects that students broadly perceive as funny, yet less than 5% of students perceive as offensive. We also identified a suite of subjects that some students perceive as funny, yet more than 50% of students perceive as offensive. Specifically, female students were more likely to be offended by humor used by instructors. We hope that these findings will aid in the development of more inclusive classrooms by encouraging instructors to use humor that is most likely to benefit all students.",2018,/,FASEB Journal,32,1 Supplement 1,,622542034,,,#92,Cooper 2018,"",""

A study of the perception of health risks among college students in China,Zhang C.; ; Fan J.,"The present survey was designed to investigate the perception of health risks among college students in China. The data are the responses of a sample of 3,069 college students at one university to surveys that include measures of several dimensions of public judgments about fifteen specific hazards. Chinese college students conveyed their concerns as falling into three broad categories: Environmental (e.g., global warming, natural catastrophes, the ozone hole, air pollution, chemical pollution, pesticides in food), Technological (e.g., nuclear power stations, thermal power, genetically modified food, medical X-rays), and Social (cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, overtime study or work, mental stress, motor vehicle accidents). The data were collected with a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the levels of perceived risk according to the percent of ""high risk"" responses as well as the mean response values. Generally, the hazards that were perceived as posing the greatest health risk were those belonging to the social health risks; items related to technology risks received the lowest percentage of ""high health risk"" rankings. Traditional environmental risks such as natural catastrophes, pollution issues (chemical pollution, air pollution), and pesticides in food were ranked as being relatively high risks. The respondents were less concerned about new emerging issues and long-term environmental risks (global warming). In this survey, motor vehicle accidents were considered to be a ""high health risk"" by the greatest percentage of respondents. Generally speaking, the female respondents' degree of recognition of health risks is higher than that of male respondents. Only for the item of smoking was the male respondents' degree higher than that of females. There is also a geographic imbalance in the health risk perceptions. The degree of recognition of health risks from respondents in municipalities is generally lower than that of respondents from other areas except for items such as natural disasters, smoking, medical X-rays, and mental stress, which are exceptions. &#xa9; 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2013,/,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10,6,2133EP  - 2149,369013575,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph10062133,23712317,#95,Zhang 2013,"",""

Sex differences in periodontal disease and caries in a Portuguese identified skeletal sample from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,Wasterlain S.N.; ,"Archaeological studies frequently fail to consider sex when reporting oral diseases in past populations. In those studies where this has been attempted, men were found to be more affected by periodontitis and less prone to caries than women. If this is so then, where both sexes are combined together, it is implicitly assumed that they have an equal chance of being recorded, in all assemblages studied. This is not the case for most archaeological collections, which often have fewer than expected female skeletons. The aim of this study is to compare data derived from skeletal samples with statistics compiled from epidemiological studies to determine if sex is essential or not to account for in future archaeological studies. Periodontal disease and caries were investigated in 600 individuals belonging to the identified skeletal collections of the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Periodontal status was assessed based on the textural and architectural variations of the interdental septum and the extent of bone loss. Dental lesions were judged to be caries if there was a discernable white or brown spot in the enamel. Men were more susceptible to periodontal disease than women. Not only did men have less healthy areas than women, but they also showed more sites with gingivitis and periodontitis. Higher caries rates were observed in females than in males for upper teeth.

Addressing Unintended Consequences of Gender Diversity Interventions on Women's Sense of Belonging in STEM,"Pietri, ES; Hennes, EP; Dovidio, JF; Brescoll, VL; Bailey, AH; Moss-Racusin, CA; Handelsman, J","Validated interventions that increase bias literacy (i.e., knowledge of gender bias) and decrease sexism are critical to addressing pervasive gender biases in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, interventions that highlight existing gender inequities may inadvertently act as a social identity threat cue for women. Including identity-safe cues in diversity interventions (i.e., suggesting that women are valued in STEM) may lessen these problematic outcomes. To explore this possibility, we conducted three experiments utilizing Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM (VIDS), a validated diversity intervention relying on high quality videos to convey the existence of gender bias in STEM. Consistent with prior research, relative to control conditions, VIDS led to greater bias literacy and lower gender bias among both men and women (Experiments 1 and 2) and encouraged women's intentions to take collective action (Experiment 2). At the same time, compared to control conditions, VIDS resulted in lower sense of belonging in the sciences, greater negative affect, and greater self-reported social identity threat, both among women from the general U.S. population (Experiments 1 and 2) and female scientists (Experiment 3). Including identity-safe cues, which present a positive female scientist role model (Experiment 2) or suggest that gender bias can be overcome (Experiments 2 and 3), helped alleviate VIDS' harmful effects on women's belonging and trust in the sciences, but had limited impact on stereotype threat.

Towards equitable learning environments for medical education: Bias and the intersection of social identities,"Bochatay, N; Bajwa, NM; Ju, M; Appelbaum, NP; van Schaik, SM","Context Medical educators are increasingly paying attention to how bias creates inequities that affect learners across the medical education continuum. Such bias arises from learners' social identities. However, studies examining bias and social identities in medical education tend to focus on one identity at a time, even though multiple identities often interact to shape individuals' experiences. Methods This article examines prior studies on bias and social identity in medical education, focusing on three social identities that commonly elicit bias: race, gender and profession. By applying the lens of intersectionality, we aimed to generate new insights into intergroup relations and identify strategies that may be employed to mitigate bias and inequities across all social identities. Results Although different social identities can be more or less salient at different stages of medical training, they intersect and impact learners' experiences. Bias towards racial and gender identities affect learners' ability to reach different stages of medical education and influence the specialties they train in. Bias also makes it difficult for learners to develop their professional identities as they are not perceived as legitimate members of their professional groups, which influences interprofessional relations. To mitigate bias across all identities, three main sets of strategies can be adopted. These strategies include equipping individuals with skills to reflect upon their own and others' social identities; fostering in-group cohesion in ways that recognise intersecting social identities and challenges stereotypes through mentorship; and addressing intergroup boundaries through promotion of allyship, team reflexivity and conflict management. Conclusions Examining how different social identities intersect and lead to bias and inequities in medical education provides insights into ways to address these problems.

Academics as Agentic Superheroes: Female academics' lack of fit with the agentic stereotype of success limits their career advancement,"Van Veelen, R; Derks, B","Gender gaps in academia persist with women being less likely to attain leadership, earning lower salaries, and receiving less research funding and resources compared to their male peers. The current research demonstrates yet another, more intangible gender gap in academia called lack of fit, whereby compared to male academics, female academics perceive higher misfit between their professional self-concept and the agentic 'superhero' stereotype of the successful academic. The entire population of Dutch academics (i.e., assistant, associate, and full professors from 14 universities) was approached to participate in a nationwide survey. Results from this unique dataset (N = 3978) demonstrate that academics perceive agency (e.g., self-confident, self-focused, competitive) as more descriptive of the stereotypical successful academic than communality (e.g., team-oriented, good teacher, collegial). Importantly, early career female academics perceived highest lack of fit with this narrowly-defined agentic occupational stereotype, which was correlated with lower work engagement, professional identification and career efficacy, and higher work exhaustion and exit intentions. Thus, lack of fit seems yet another barrier contributing to pervasive gender gaps in academia.

"Two Brief Interventions to Mitigate a ""Chilly Climate"" Transform Women's Experience, Relationships, and Achievement in Engineering","Walton, GM; Logel, C; Peach, JM; Spencer, SJ; Zanna, MP","In a randomized-controlled trial, we tested 2 brief interventions designed to mitigate the effects of a ""chilly climate"" women may experience in engineering, especially in male-dominated fields. Participants were students entering a selective university engineering program. The social-belonging intervention aimed to protect students' sense of belonging in engineering by providing a nonthreatening narrative with which to interpret instances of adversity. The affirmation- training intervention aimed to help students manage stress that can arise from social marginalization by incorporating diverse aspects of their self-identity in their daily academic lives. As expected, gender differences and intervention effects were concentrated in male-dominated majors (<20% women). In these majors, compared with control conditions, both interventions raised women's school-reported engineering grade-point-average (GPA) over the full academic year, eliminating gender differences. Both also led women to view daily adversities as more manageable and improved women's academic attitudes. However, the 2 interventions had divergent effects on women's social experiences. The social-belonging intervention helped women integrate into engineering, for instance, increasing friendships with male engineers. Affirmation-training helped women develop external resources, deepening their identification with their gender group.

Gender Issues in Engineering Education: What Systemizing and Empathizing Have to Do with It,"ASME; Fertig, J; Kumpaty, S","More than half of U.S. students entering college are female, but female students are still largely absent from engineering fields. The persistent absence of females in engineering may owe itself at least in part, to a fundamental difference in cognitive approaches between males and females. Although there is a significant amount of cross-over, males are more likely than females to have a systemizing brain, which is associated with a drive to understand how the world works through the identification and creation of patterns and rules. Females are more likely to be born with an empathizing style, which lends itself to a natural aptitude for identifying others' thoughts and emotions. This systemizing-empathizing dichotomy is based on the work of Simon Baron-Cohen at the University of Cambridge in the UK. Engineering programs are geared toward those with a higher SQ (systemizing quotient). This paper reviews relevant research on how systemizing-empathizing (S-E) theory applies to engineering education and examines current research on the reasons behind the dearth of females in engineering, finding that the contemporary engineering culture in college is also characterized by subtle forms of discrimination that systematically direct women away from engineering.

Belonging in general chemistry predicts first-year undergraduates' performance and attrition,"Fink, A; Frey, RF; Solomon, ED","Feeling a sense of belonging in a learning environment can have positive effects on student success. The impact of this psychosocial variable on undergraduates' achievement and retention has been demonstrated in STEM disciplines, especially for women within physical sciences where large disparities in gender representation persist. The current study explores the relationship between belonging and student success in undergraduate chemistry, where greater gender parity has recently emerged. In particular, this research investigates the belonging of first-year students enrolled in a two-semester General Chemistry course sequence. The study begins by examining whether students' early sense of belonging in the course, indexed by two survey measures (perceived belonging, belonging uncertainty) varies depending on their demographics and academic preparation. The belonging measures are then used as predictors of performance in General Chemistry 1 and 2 and attrition from one semester to the next. Paralleling research in other STEM disciplines, the results show that female students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, reported lower belonging and higher uncertainty than male students within the first weeks of the course. After accounting for demographics, preparation, and participation in a course supplemental program, the belonging measures predicted performance and attrition for all students.

The Influence of Romantic Partners on Women in STEM Majors,"Barth, JM; Dunlap, S; Chappetta, K","It has been widely suggested that women are under-represented in STEM fields because careers in these fields are perceived as incompatible with other traditionally feminine roles and life goals such as helping others or maintaining a marriage and family.

The tribal population is distinct from the general population in terms of their unique cultural, traditional, and reproductive health practices. Therefore, the aim of the study was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the menstrual practices, fertility intentions and decision-making regarding family planning among various indigenous tribal women of Kerala. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted among the tribal women of Wayanad district using the grounded theory approach. Using purposive sampling 16 in-depth interviews, 6 key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussion (FGD) s were conducted. Interview guides were developed for in-depth interviews, key-informant interviews, and focus group discussion through extensive formative research with literature reviews and taking expert opinions. The interviews were conducted among women of reproductive age and their spouses hailing from Paniya and Kurichiya tribal groups in Kalpetta and Mananthavady areas of Wayanad district. Key informant interviews were also conducted among doctors, pharmacists, and community health workers. Results: The key findings of this study were the identification of a web of cultural practices pertaining to menstruation among persons of tribal origin. Unique traditional practices such as ""Valayamapura"" and ""Thirandukalyanam"" were reported and most of the women were keen to carry it forward. Fertility desires among couples were found to be not significantly influenced by any gender bias. Decision-making regarding family size were found to be on a mutual agreement between the spouses. The tribal women were aware of modern spacing methods, but preferred natural methods of contraception for temporary use and tubectomy as the permanent method. Non-contraceptive use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) was prevalent, and the majority took it occasionally for postponement of menstruation to attend various social events. Conclusion: Menstruation-related myths and practices are prevalent and require educational interventions. More focus needs to be given to male sterilization as the permanent method of contraception.

Workplace Belonging of Women Healthcare Professionals Relates to Likelihood of Leaving,"Schaechter, J; Goldstein, R; Zafonte, R; Silver, JK","Purpose: There is a high rate of attrition of professionals from healthcare institutions, which threatens the economic viability of these institutions and the quality of care they provide to patients. Women professionals face particular challenges that may lower their sense of belonging in the healthcare workplace. We sought to test the hypothesis that workplace belonging of women healthcare professionals relates to the likelihood that they expect to leave their institution.Methods: Participants of a continuing education course on women's leadership skills in health care completed a survey about their experiences of belonging in workplace and their likelihood of leaving that institution within the next 2 years. An association between workplace belonging (measured by the cumulative number of belonging factors experienced, scale 0-10) and likelihood of leaving (measured on a 5-point Likert scale) was evaluated using ordinal logistic regression. The relative importance of workplace belonging factors in predicting the likelihood of leaving was assessed using dominance analysis.Results: Ninety-nine percent of survey participants were women, and 63% were clinicians. Sixty-one percent of participants reported at least a slight likelihood of leaving their healthcare institution within the next 2 years. Greater workplace belonging was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the reported likelihood of leaving their institution after accounting for the number of years having worked in their current institution, underrepresented minority status, and the interaction between the latter two covariates. The workplace belonging factor found to be most important in predicting the likelihood of leaving was the belief that there was an opportunity to thrive professionally in the institution. Belonging factors involving feeling able to freely share thoughts and opinions were also found to be of relatively high importance in predicting the likelihood of leaving.Conclusion: Greater workplace belonging was found to relate significantly to a reduced likelihood of leaving their institution within the next 2 years.

Findings indicated that final exam score was moderately related to ratings of subjective social status, suggesting that factors besides objective course performance may influence classroom subjective social status. When asked to explain how they evaluated their standing in the course, students reported five main themes, including both academic achievement with respect to exam scores and their understanding of course content. When examining differences by status-based identities in subjective social status, we found that female and first-generation students had lower subjective social status compared to their male and continuing-generation peers, although results were less robust for first-generation status. Likewise, working students reported lower subjective social status relative to non-working students, despite showing no difference in final exam score. In contrast, although Asian/Asian American students outperformed Latine students, there were no differences in reports of subjective social status between Asian/Asian American, Latine, and white students.

We further explore whether women experience lower social and ability belonging than men on average in pSTEM and whether belonging more strongly relates to intentions to persist for women. At three time points throughout a semester, we assessed undergraduate pSTEM majors enrolled in a foundational calculus or physics course. Women reported lower pSTEM ability belonging and self-efficacy than men but higher identification with pSTEM. End-of-semester social belonging, ability belonging, and identification predicted intentions to persist in pSTEM, with a stronger relationship between social belonging and intentions to persist in pSTEM for women than men.

They're Comparing Me to Her: Social Comparison Perceptions Reduce Belonging and STEM Engagement Among Women With Token Status,"Derricks, V; Sekaquaptewa, D","Belonging and academic engagement are important predictors of women's retention in STEM. To better understand the processes influencing these outcomes, we investigate how numerical underrepresentation (i.e., token status) triggers social comparison perceptions-concerns that others are comparing oneself to another person-that can undermine women's STEM outcomes. Across four experiments, female college students recruited via subject pool (Study 1a) and MTurk (Studies 1b-3) read a hypothetical scenario in which another female (Studies 1a-3) or male (Study 2) student performed well or poorly in an engineering course. Findings showed that having token (vs. non-token) status in the course increased social comparison perceptions (i.e., perceptions about being compared to an ingroup peer), which subsequently reduced course belonging (Studies 1a and 1b). Study 2 found that (a) token status increased social comparison perceptions in response to the ingroup (vs. outgroup) peer and (b) social comparison perceptions decreased belonging through stereotype threat concerns, particularly when the peer performed poorly. Study 3 directly manipulated social comparison perceptions to further establish their causal role on negative outcomes and demonstrated that these perceived direct comparisons predicted additional consequences signaling STEM disengagement. Collectively, findings identify a novel process that can diminish belonging and academic engagement for women in STEM.",2021,,PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY,45,3,325-350,WOS:000644038800001,10.1177/03616843211005447,,#162,Derricks 2021,"",""

Students (N=340; 68.5% female), were eligible to participate if they identified as a member of a historically underrepresented racial or ethnic group, as first-generation college students, and/or if their families were economically disadvantaged. Data were collected over three time points during students' first two academic years attending a predominantly white institution. We explored the potential association between ECAI and grade point average (GPA) in the context of students' experiences of discrimination by testing depressive symptoms as a mediator and ECAI as a compensatory factor. Bootstrapped confidence intervals of the standardized indirect effect indicated that discrimination at time one indirectly predicted lower GPAs at time three via greater depressive symptoms, while ECAI at time one acted conversely and indirectly predicted higher GPAs at time three via fewer depressive symptoms. These results suggest that promoting ECAI may be an effective strategy to facilitate academic success by countering negative psychological health outcomes stemming from underrepresented students' experiences of discrimination.",2019,,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION,22,2,421-446,WOS:000466083700009,10.1007/s11218-019-09484-8,,#163,Billingsley 2019,"",""

This study tests whether Kanter's (Men and women of the corporation, Basic Books, New York, 1977) theory of proportions, which suggests that numerical representation of groups influence group dynamics and cultural context, applies to the proportion of female faculty and the probability that female doctoral students will complete their degrees in science and engineering. Using data from two research-intensive academic institutions, results show that female doctoral students are more likely to complete the degree in departments with higher proportions of female faculty. Further, female PhD students working with female faculty dissertation advisors are also more likely to complete the degree than female PhD students working with male faculty dissertation advisors. Departmental faculty sex ratios and whether their faculty advisor is male or female, however, have no effect on the completion probabilities of male PhD students.

Breaking Barriers: Investigating the Sense of Belonging Among Women and Non-Binary Students in Software Engineering,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY; Boman, L; Andersson, J; Neto, FGD","Women in computing were among the first programmers in the early 20(th) century and were substantial contributors to the industry. Today, men dominate the software engineering industry. Research and data show that women are far less likely to pursue a career in this industry, and those that do are less likely than men to stay in it. Reasons for women and other underrepresented minorities to leave the industry are a lack of opportunities for growth and advancement, unfair treatment and workplace culture. This research explores how the potential to cultivate or uphold an industry unfavourable to women and non-binary individuals manifests in software engineering education at the university level. For this purpose, the study includes surveys and interviews. We use gender name perception as a survey instrument, and the results show small differences in perceptions of software engineering students based on their gender. Particularly, the survey respondents anchor the values of the male software engineer (Hans) to a variety of technical and non-technical skills, while the same description for a female software engineer (Hanna) is anchored mainly by her managerial skills. With interviews with women and non-binary students, we gain insight on the main barriers to their sense of ambient belonging.

We explain why this body of work, which had grown rapidly in the last 20 years, departs from the original formulation of objectification theory (Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997). We compare the different operationalizations of state self-objectification and examine how they map onto its theoretical definition, concluding that the operationalizations have focused mostly on one component of this construct (concerns about one's physical appearance) while neglecting others (adopting a third-person perspective and treating oneself as a dehumanized object). We review the main findings of studies that experimentally induced state self-objectification and examined its affective, motivational, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological outcomes. We note that three core outcomes of this state as specified by objectification theory (safety anxiety, reduced flow experiences, and awareness of internal body states) have hardly been examined so far. Most importantly, we introduce an integrative process model, suggesting that the reported effects are triggered by four different mechanisms: appearance monitoring, experience of discrepancy from appearance standards, stereotype threat, and activation of the ""sex object"" schema. We propose strategies for distinguishing between these mechanisms and explain the theoretical and practical importance of doing so.",2018,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,9,,,WOS:000441438800001,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01268,,#168,Kahalon 2018,"",""
Examining the relationship between disciplinary counterspaces for undergraduate women and sense of belonging: A physics exemplar,"Hazari, Z; Rodriguez, I","For students who face marginalization in a discipline, counterspaces are safe spaces of refuge that allow them to express their multiple identities and foster their sense of belonging. While prior qualitative work on counterspaces has highlighted how and why these spaces support marginalized students, there is little quantitative work that provides systemic evidence on broad counterspace initiatives formed to support students' disciplinary sense of belonging. In physics, a discipline that is deeply androcentric, two potential counterspaces have emerged for undergraduate women: the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) and Women in Physics Groups (WiPG). Drawing on survey data collected from undergraduate women in physics programs across the country who were registering for the 2018 CUWiP (N = 1388), we used structural equation modeling to test the effect of earlier participation in CUWiP and WiPG on students' current sense of belonging and interest in physics. We also tested the mediating effect of believing that there are serious gender issues in physics since these spaces have been found to increase students' consciousness of gender bias. The results revealed a significant positive direct effect of CUWiP and WiPG on sense of belonging. A more complex story emerged for indirect effects where believing in serious gender issues can negatively affect sense of belonging if interest in physics is not positively reinforced. Overall, the findings clearly provide quantitative evidence that broad diversity conference and affinity group initiatives, such as CUWiP and WiPG, can act as counterspaces that bolster belonging for women in disciplines like physics where they are marginalized. However, activities in these spaces should also continue to foster students' unique disciplinary interests.",2024,,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,61,10,2336-2361,WOS:001229385900001,10.1002/tea.21962,,#169,Hazari 2024,"",""
Are You In or Are You Out?

Social-cognitive accounts suggest they stem from differential attention and facial processing, following the categorisation of a face as belonging to an ""in"" or ""out"" group. Three studies explored whether OGBs can be produced by mere categorisation at encoding and investigated the role of in-group membership saliency on face recognition. Participants saw 40 facial images fictionally grouped according to in-/out-group status. Studies 1 and 2 used university membership as the grouping variable and found no evidence of an OGB, and no relationship between OGB magnitude and salience of group membership. Study 3 used the same design as Study 2, but with a highly salient group characteristic: participants' stance on the U.K. Referendum (i.e., whether they were ""Leave"" or ""Remain"" supporters). In this case, an asymmetrical OGB was found, with only Remain voters demonstrating an OGB. Furthermore, a relationship between OGB magnitude and attitude toward the Referendum result was found. Overall, our results suggest that social categorisation and membership saliency alone may not be enough to moderate in- and out-group face recognition.

This study examines how the constructs posited by prior work as important for physics identity, as well as an additional theorized construct, may interrelate and affect female students' physics identity differently depending on the context. Context in this study refers to two different experiential levels in college. The constructs examined include performance/competence, recognition, and interest, as well as sense of belonging. In particular, we used structural equation modeling to examine the effect that these constructs have on the physics identity of two groups of female physics undergraduates: first year students and senior year students. The results reveal that the relationship of the theorized constructs with physics identity vary between the two groups as well as compared to prior research with broad college student populations (not just physics majors). Unlike broad college student populations, for our sample of female physics undergraduates, interest did not have a direct effect on physics identity while sense of belonging was significant only for senior year students.

Double Trouble: How Being Outnumbered and Negatively Stereotyped Threatens Career Outcomes of Women in STEM,"van Veelen, R; Derks, B; Endedijk, MD","Masculine work contexts form an important source of social identity threat for working women. But what aspect of masculine work contexts is most threatening to women's gender identity at work: A numerical majority of male colleagues (i.e., numerical male dominance), working in a profession in which women are negatively stereotyped (i.e., normative male dominance), or the combination? The current study aimed to disentangle these two aspects of masculine work contexts by testing its combined impact on the experience of gender identity threat among women and men who work in the STEM sector (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). A field study was conducted among women (N = 177) and men (N = 630) graduates holding an academic degree in a STEM educational program. Respondents either worked in- or outside the STEM sector (i.e., stronger vs. weaker gender stereotype) and estimated the ratio of men to women in their direct work environment. Results from a Structural Equation Model demonstrated that women in STEM face double trouble: The combination of working almost solely with male colleagues (being outnumbered) and working in the technical sector (where women are negatively stereotyped) predicted the highest levels of experienced gender identity threat, particularly among women who highly identified with their gender group. Gender identity threat, in turn, negatively predicted women's work engagement and career confidence. Men did not face double trouble: Their experience of gender identity threat was not related to working in a masculine STEM sector.

Self-efficacy and belonging: the impact of a university makerspace,"Andrews, ME; Borrego, M; Boklage, A","Background In recent years, makerspaces have become increasingly common venues of STEM education and are rapidly being incorporated into undergraduate programs. These spaces give students and instructors access to advanced design technology and facilitate the incorporation of a wide variety of projects into the curriculum; however, their impacts on students are not yet fully understood. Using matched survey responses (i.e., repeated measures) from undergraduate students enrolled in engineering courses that assigned a makerspace-based project, we evaluate how the use of a university makerspace impacts students' attitudes towards design, engineering, and technology. Further, we examine whether there are differences based on students' year in program, gender, and race. Results Paired t-tests were used to analyze whether and how nine factors changed within individual students over one semester. Analyses revealed that students who visited the facility showed significant gains in measures of innovation orientation, design self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, belonging to the makerspace, and belonging to the engineering community. Subsequently, repeated measures analyses of variance (RMANOVAs) on the students who visited the makerspace revealed significant main effects of students' year in program, gender, and race, as well as interactional effects of both year in program and race with time. Conclusions These results affirm the value of incorporating makerspace-based projects into STEM curricula, especially during early coursework. However, our analyses revealed consistent gender gaps in measures of self-efficacy before and after using the makerspace.

Localizing Modern Female Subjectivities: World Society and the Spatial Negotiation of Gender Norms in Turkey,"Yüksel, G; Stetter, S; Walter, J","In our article, we analyze gender norms in Turkey. We are interested in how such norms are transformed or reified in light of global/local interplays in contemporary world society. The case of Turkey is usually studied with a view to a persistent gap between national/global constitutional and legal provisions that promote gender equality, on the one hand, and a seemingly resistant everyday reality, on the other. While our research in the Turkish province of Hatay confirms that such a gap persists, we nevertheless detect meaningful transformations of gender norms in everyday practice. Our research, which focuses in women's positioning in higher education, indicates that such transformations occur in particular through everyday spatial practices, inter alia through what we refer to as local tactics of mobility by women seeking higher education. While there is no linear and direct diffusion of gender norms from the global/national to the local, we nevertheless observe significant global/local interplays to which these local norm transformations relate. These interplays can be well captured on the basis of constructivist theories of modernity. More specifically, by drawing from theories of world society and global governmentality, we conceive of these spatial practices as a diffusion of forms of (female) modern subjectivities, engendered by modern technologies of the Self, through which women in Hatay locate themselves in relation to a world society shaped by societal differentiation and social exclusion. Transformations or reifications of gender norms in Hatay are thus not so much the result of a direct diffusion of global gender norms. They are rather triggered indirectly through spatial practices on the local level that are, in turn, embedded within a world societal horizon that promotes modern subjectivities in response to societal differentiation and social exclusion.",2016,,ALTERNATIVES,41,2,59-82,WOS:000394559800001,10.1177/0304375416689691,,#174,Yüksel 2016,"",""

"Self-efficacy, Interest, and Belongingness - URM Students' Momentary Experiences in CS1","ACM; Lishinski, A; Narvaiz, S; Rosenberg, JM","Educational stakeholders want to understand and overcome the well-documented racial and gender disparities within computer science education. There are many factors that influence students' participation, performance, and persistence in CS courses, including motivational and affective factors. Prior research in CS education has documented the influence of these factors on students' CS outcomes generally, and on URM students in particular. What has been less investigated, is how students' motivational and affective experiences in CS develop and evolve from moment to moment, particularly for URM students. To better understand how these experiences develop, this paper presents the results of a study using intensive longitudinal methods which examined the differences in momentary experiences between racially underrepresented students and their represented peers in undergraduate introductory computer science courses. Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), we solicited responses on students' momentary self-efficacy, interest, and affective experiences 8-18 times in each of two semesters from a total of 110 CS students, of which 19 identified as racially underrepresented.Analyzing the data using a Bayesian multivariate multilevel modeling approach, we found that students' pre-semester self-efficacy impacted their momentary frustration, interest, and self-efficacy throughout the duration of the semester, as expected. Likewise, students' baseline interest significantly impacted their momentary self-efficacy and interest. Baseline sense of belonging, by contrast, showed no significant impact on their momentary experiences. We also examined how students' affective experiences relate to course outcomes and found that baseline self-efficacy significantly predicts end-of-course grades for URM students. Overall, this study highlights that students' self-efficacy and interest are important for their momentary experiences, and course outcomes for URM students, while their sense of belonging did not make a significant impact. We expected that these influences might differ in magnitude for URM students, although a larger sample size and greater statistical power is needed to substantiate this possibility.

Facilitating the self-determination of undergraduate women in physics: the role of external validation,"Nehmeh, G; Kelly, AM","Background: The representation of women in physics majors is persistently low despite ongoing calls for reforms to improve gender equality. This article builds upon prior research by applying the sociocognitive construct of self-determination in analysing women's experiences leading to their choice of physics study, along with factors affecting their behavioural persistence and physics identity. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine variables affecting women's physics identities and persistence in pursuing their physics degrees. Factors were explored that impacted the self-determination of women in physics, that is, how their personal resources and socialisation facilitated regulatory behaviours to be successful in the major. Sample: Six women physics majors were recruited from a research university in the Northeast U.S., where all had participated in undergraduate physics research. Design and Methods: This qualitative cross-case study focused on undergraduate women to analyse factors that influenced their experiences in the major. Data collection focused on motivation and support, challenges they encountered, and how they overcame them. By examining these factors, common themes were identified regarding their recruitment and retention in physics, specifically in terms of social integration and external validation. Interview transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological approach to generate a set of integrated themes providing a theoretical explanation for physics major selection and persistence that incorporated aspects of competence, autonomy and social relatedness. Results: The support of faculty, research opportunities and peer socialisation were factors that contributed to the development of self-determination. Hindrances that impacted women's undergraduate experiences included negative gender stereotypes, persistent self-doubt, minority status and unwelcoming classroom cultures. Self-determination was characterised by social integration, confidence, and individual and collective agency.

Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out on a sample of 844 workers from public hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health of the province of Cordoba during the years 2013 and 2014. A self administered questionnaire was used and univariate analysis and bivariate analysis were done. For the assessment of factors associated with vaccination, chi square statistics was applied; a 5% margin of error was defined (p <= 0.05) and a confidence interval of 95 %. Results: The proportion of professionals and technicians with coverage was: Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine (DT) 87.2%, Hepatitis B vaccine 77.6%, MMR vaccine or Measles and Rubella vaccine 69.0% and influenza vaccine 55.2%. Better immunization status was found among those with higher education, less seniority, and younger age with significant differences regarding sex in hepatitis B and less seniority in Measles and Rubella vaccine. Conclusion: The workers studied present an immunization status below the one internationally recommended. However, it is similar or higher to the level reported in different countries, showing that the under-coverage of health professionals is an outspread problem that must be prioritized by the authorities, given the implications for the workers themselves and the population they assist.",2015,,REVISTA DE SALUD PUBLICA-CORDOBA,19,3,21-31,WOS:000393485500003,,,#182,Acevedo 2015,"",""
Inside the prism of an invisible threat: Shining a light on the hidden work of contending with systemic stereotype threat in STEM fields,"Block, CJ; Cruz, M; Bairley, M; Harel-Marian, T; Roberson, L","The purpose of the present research was to understand how individuals navigate careers in professional contexts that are infused with systemic stereotype threat. Systemic stereotype threat occurs when an individual is in a system that is characterized by gender or racial disparities and the implicit belief about the reason for these disparities is stereotypes about the deficits of women or people of color, rather than systemic inequalities. We conducted in-depth interviews with 26 women scientists in a top-tier academic research institution, a context that is steeped in negative stereotypes about women's ability and commitment as a reason for their underrepresentation. Stereotype threatening systems create the conditions for women scientists to experience heightened visibility due to their gender and heightened invisibility of the characteristics that make them successful scientists. We found that the strategies that women use to navigate in stereotype-threatening systems were patterned based on the goals that women had for managing their (in) visibility and that these goals were based on their understanding of the reasons for their underrepresentation in STEM fields. The three response patterns that emerged were: Fending Off the Threat, Confronting the Threat and Sustaining Self in the Presence of the Threat. The importance of understanding the variety of strategies that individuals use to manage (in)visibility while working in stereotype-threatening systems is discussed.",2019,,JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL BEHAVIOR,113,,33-50,WOS:000483008900004,10.1016/j.jvb.2018.09.007,,#183,Block 2019,"",""
"A Larger 'We'; Identity, Spirituality and Social Change in Pluralistic Societies","Sharp, DN","Over the last decade, in the United States in particular, there has been an increasingly acute awareness of historic and ongoing social, racial, gender, and other disparities, and the frequent deployment of categories (for example BIPOC, LGBTQQIA2SP+, Latinx) and concepts (for example 'cultural appropriation', 'white privilege', 'intersectionality') that centre thinking and conversations around various axes of difference. For some critics, the hyper-focus on questions of difference is dismissed as 'wokeness', and its seeming ascendency across elite spaces-academic, cultural, and corporate-is viewed with alarm, particularly insofar as its advocates are seen to champion a type of illiberalism. Others have raised concerns that hyper-identitarianism may diminish possibilities for worker and class solidarity, or that it represents only an attenuated form of social justice. This article adds to this conversation by asking whether the energetic foregrounding of difference typical of 'wokeness' does not also pose a spiritual conundrum. To explore this question, it outlines what is here called the 'connective worldview', which draws from deep ecology, spiritual practices, and mystical insights common to many religious traditions to understand humans and their identities as interdependent, ephemeral and, ultimately, subject to transcendence. The article contrasts this with the 'particularistic worldview', which tends to set both individual and group identities in sharp relief, emphasizing the need to honour and manage difference. It argues that an 'integrated' perspective-one that strikes a balance between both world-views-will be key for activists looking to foment social change while forging a larger 'we' in diverse, pluralistic societies.",2024,,JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE,16,1,462-476,WOS:001064991000001,10.1093/jhuman/huad041,,#184,Sharp 2024,"",""
Exploring the association between communicating about NMR spectra and acute awareness of stigma attached to one's gender among women in postsecondary organic chemistry courses,"Connor, MC; Parvin, AR; Browning, AF","Women report that they must conform to masculine behavioral norms to progress in chemistry, with the necessity of adopting such norms pushing them from the field. Advancing gender-based equity within chemistry will thus entail identifying these norms, deconstructing them, and, ultimately, redefining them to be inclusive of all individuals. To support these efforts, this study investigates whether engaging in a traditional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) communication task versus a similar task with multiple identity-safe cues differentially impacts individuals' gender stigma consciousness, or the extent to which individuals are acutely aware of stigma attached to their gender. Undergraduates (n = 543) enrolled in Organic Chemistry II at a large university in the southeastern United States completed an online NMR communication task followed by a version of the Social Identities and Attitudes Scale (SIAS) modified for use in chemistry learning environments (i.e., the SIAS-Chem). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two prompt groups prior to task completion: one group was told the task evaluates their NMR communication ability, and the other group was told the task was non-evaluative and used to understand the different ways people communicate. The results provide initial psychometric evidence of the SIAS-Chem's functionality and measurement invariance across prompt groups, providing preliminary support for its use in identifying chemistry practices that are potentially exclusionary of women. Further, women who were told the task evaluates NMR communication ability reported greater gender stigma consciousness on the SIAS-Chem compared to women who were told the task was non-evaluative, while there is no evidence of men scoring differently across prompts. Gender stigma consciousness was also associated with confidence during task completion among women who were told the task was non-evaluative. The findings have implications for the design of equitable assessments and instruction on NMR spectroscopy and future research on communication styles in chemistry.",2024,,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,,,,WOS:001391481000001,10.1039/d4rp00193a,,#185,Connor 2024,"",""

Social identity management strategies of women in STEM fields,"Ryan, AM; King, DD; Elizondo, F; Wadlington, P","Recruiting and retaining women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations is seen as challenging, and researchers have begun to consider how women manage their identity in these contexts in response to potential questions of fit. Within identity management theoretical work, there has been little attention to occupational influences. Based on role congruity theory, we investigate occupational characteristics as influences on women's gender identity management, along with individual differences and organizational support influences. Results suggest that engaging in identity management behaviours is unrelated to the gender stereotypicality or gender composition of the field, but that support, fit (i.e., congruence between the interests of the individual and occupation), and personality affect engagement in these behaviours. Implications for enhancing the experiences of women in STEM fields as well as for social identity-related research more broadly are discussed. Practitioner pointsIndividuals may differ in how they choose to address stigmatization at work, based on their personality and fit with the position. Perceived organizational support is associated with willingness to engage in stigmatization confronting strategies.

I use social comparison and relative deprivation, a subsidiary theory of social comparison, as guiding theoretical frameworks. Since the intersections of race and gender are salient, I also incorporate an intersectional framework as an analytical tool. Through data derived from semi-structured interviews, I find that, when describing graduate-school experiences, Black engineering and computer science respondents use social comparisons with regard to race, gender, and their intersections to juxtapose their experiences with those of their peers. Participants described feeling relatively deprived due to inequities resulting from racism and/or sexism and primarily felt that STEM privileged students that were Asian men. Nevertheless, Black men described downward social comparisons with their Black female counterparts, recognizing the sexist culture of STEM. Overall, however, social comparison processes led Black respondents to identify inequities within their Ph.D. programs in engineering and computer science that made them feel as though STEM was not intended for them, but, rather, for their Asian and white male peers who are positioned as belonging.",2021,,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,91,4,751-777,WOS:000606006800001,10.1111/soin.12401,,#188,Brockman 2021,"",""

Because these teams are assembled to enhance innovations, they are most productive if they fully utilize the expertise of all team members. Applying a social relations modeling approach, two studies conducted in multidisciplinary research centers in a large public U. S. university test whether a team's gender composition predicts how well women's expertise is used within the team, based on peer evaluations of male and female team members with varying education levels. A third study returns to the same two research centers to examine whether the larger context in which the team operates affects the use of expertise and the team's productivity. An important finding is that the gender and educational attributes of the person being evaluated are less critical to the recognition of expertise than the attributes of the person conducting the evaluation and the relationship between these two team members.

"Role of mentorship, career conceptualization, and leadership in developing women's physics identity and belonging","Rosenberg, JL; Holincheck, N; Fernández, K; Dreyfus, BW; Wardere, F; Stehle, S; Butler, TN","The percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees in physics (25%) in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from 2 institutions: a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, consistent with the existing literature, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people. While the data on how career conceptualization contributed to the building of identity is limited, there are some connections to recognition and competence, and it will be an interesting avenue of future exploration.",2024,,PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,20,1,,WOS:001187566500001,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.010114,,#190,Rosenberg 2024,"",""

Is Motherhood a Burden or an Asset to Female Computer Science and Engineering Faculty?

This study drew data from ten female computer science and engineering faculty in China and Italy to demonstrate the gender-specific challenges they face. The researcher applied positioning theory to analyse female faculty's motherhood experiences. Findings suggest that the dual mother-and-educator role conflict in the intersectional space of work and family can be both a burden and an asset to female faculty. As a burden, the sociocultural expectations of the mother's role drive females to take on primary childcare responsibilities. It leads to significant barriers to female faculty's career advancements. As an asset, the study finds that the female faculty's motherhood experience allowed them to generate new insights into their identities as educators and teaching practices. Their learning from motherhood prompts them to reflect and gain an appreciation of their educator identity. Such realisation enables them to improve their teaching practices and interactions with students. The study offers policy recommendations for higher education institutions to support female faculty navigating the dual roles of mother and educator.

We investigated whether offering students the opportunity to retake an exam makes high-stakes exams more equitable. Following the control value theory of achievement emotions, we hypothesized that exam retakes would increase students' perceived control over their performance and decrease the value of a single exam attempt, thereby maximizing exam performance. We collected data on exam scores and experiences with retakes from three large introductory biology courses and assessed the effect of optional exam retakes on gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in exam scores. We found that Black/African American students and those who worked more than 20 h a week were less likely to retake exams. While exam retakes significantly improved student scores, they slightly increased racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in scores partly because of these differences in participation rates. Most students reported that retake opportunities reduced their anxiety on the initial exam attempt.

Academic Social Comparison: A Promising New Target to Reduce Fear of Negative Evaluation in Large-Enrollment College Science Courses,"Pigart, C Jynx; MacKinnon, David P; Cooper, Katelyn M","Background: Fear of negative evaluation, defined as a sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated in a social situation, is the primary factor underlying student anxiety in college science courses and is disproportionately experienced by students who are underserved in science. Yet, it is unknown why fear of negative evaluation disproportionately affects these students and what can be done to reduce student fear of negative evaluation. Academic social comparison describes how students perceive themselves compared to their peers with regard to desirability as a groupmate, the extent they fit in among others in their major, and academic talent. We hypothesize that academic social comparison mediates the relationship between student identities and fear of negative evaluation, where individuals with underserved identities in science may perceive themselves as ""less than"" their peers, contributing to their fear of negative evaluation. We surveyed 909 undergraduate science majors across 15 research-intensive institutions in the United States (U.S.) to assess: (1) To what extent do student identities predict fear of negative evaluation among science undergraduates? and (2) For identities that significantly predict fear of negative evaluation, to what extent does academic social comparison mediate the relationship? We used regression, single-mediator models, and multi-mediator models to address our research questions. Results: Women/non-binary and LGBTQ + science majors reported disproportionately high fear of negative evaluation compared to men and non-LGBTQ + science majors. Women/non-binary and LGBTQ + students also expressed lower academic social comparison relative to their respective counterparts, meaning they perceive themselves as less than their peers with regard to their desirability as a groupmate, the extent to which they fit in among others in their major, and their academic talent. Academic social comparison partially mediated the relationship between fear of negative evaluation and both gender and LGBTQ + status. Major fit, defined as the extent to which students perceive they fit in among others in their major, was found to be the primary mediating subconstruct of academic social comparison for both gender and LGBTQ + identities. Conclusions: Women/non-binary and LGBTQ + science majors perceive themselves as less than their peers to a greater extent than men and non-LGBTQ + science majors, contributing to their higher fear of negative evaluation in college science course. Major fit, defined as the extent to which students feel they fit in with others in their major, is the subconstruct of academic social comparison that had the strongest influence on fear of negative evaluation in our sample.

Professional STEM societies provide students with a range of resources that help them persist in STEM, though qualitative research shows that such societies geared toward queer and trans students may offer less professional and academic resources and prioritize identity management. The objective of our research is to identify, among queer and trans students, whether there are differences between how TNBGNC+ students and gender majoritized students access resources important in STEM persistence across professional society types, including those societies organized to serve women, racial/ethnic minoritized groups, queer and trans groups, as well as those science societies and chapters without a stated group focus. The society resources we focus on include: sense of community, social networking, professional resources, leadership skills, academic resources, reduced isolation related to identities, and perceptions that societies in which they may participate are helpful to them in their degree progress. This study offers an analysis of survey data from 477 queer and trans STEM undergraduates relating to their participation in STEM professional societies. To conduct this research, we embraced and enacted recommendations by scholars on strategies and frameworks to queer our methodology, survey, and analysis. We found that at oSTEM, TNBGNC+ students may not be benefitting to the same extent as gender majoritized students when it comes to feeling in community with other members and having opportunities for social networking. However, TNBGNC+ students may benefit more from a reduction in isolation related to their identities. Differences in how SWE served TNBGNC+ students echoes previous work, and may speak to the society's organization around the cisgender, patriarchal framework. SHPE's relative success with TNBGNC+ students also reproduces existing work, suggesting the society may be more largely scaffolded for more affirming environments writ large. As well, that science in comparison to industry chapters were more beneficial to TNBGNC+ students brings forward possible differences between science and industry chapters, in which the former may be influenced more by the scholarship and science of gender, while the latter, with its more business and public focus, could be more influenced by dominant narratives in STEM. This work has implications for societies when it comes to enacting policies to cultivate more inclusive community environments and buttress potentially unequal access to social networking as well as professional and academic resources.

For this purpose, the perspectives of students in England are brought together in this study in an attempt to better understand the concept of STEM belonging within a broader context of integration. Result: The inductive thematic analysis with the voices of socio-demographically diverse 313 A-level, undergraduate and postgraduate Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry students showed that compared to male students, it was mostly female, non-binary, non-White, and first-generation students who defined STEM belonging as 'Feeling safe and comfortable in the STEM community and settings'. This theme was defined by the participants as the group/community/learning environment in which the individual belongs, the interaction with the people in the field, and the comfort that this participation/interaction creates. Students stressed the importance of creating a supportive and welcoming STEM environment so that individuals can feel at home, as well as a safe and comfortable STEM environment for people of all identities, genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Based on the participants' responses, this study also conceptualised the concept of STEM belonging as having four phases: the 'adaptation phase', the 'integration phase', the 'continuum phase', and the 'transition phase'. These four phases which comprise the STEM belonging concept are consecutive and interconnected. Conclusion: The study concluded that all human beings are connected in a relational way (either strong or weak) and that the concept of STEM belonging develops as a result of interactions with 'self' and 'others' who have a shared passion and an interest in STEM fields. Although individuals have intrinsic motivation and individual prompts in STEM fields (i.e. resilience, beliefs in their capacity/ability and curiosity, etc.), social determinants (i.e. receiving adequate support from members of the STEM community, social capital and social cohesion, etc.) also play a significant role in influencing individual's sense of STEM belonging.",2024,,International Journal of STEM Education,11,,,3040244908; EJ1412882,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-024-00472-9,,#206,Dost 2024,"",""

"""I Try to Encourage My Students to Think, Read, and Talk Science"" Intelligible Identities in University Teachers' Figured Worlds of Higher Education Biology","Günter, Katerina Pia; Ahnesjö, Ingrid; Gullberg, Annica","Higher education biology is often imagined, perceived, and described as having reached gender equality in terms of who gets to participate in disciplinary practices. However, like any other natural science discipline, higher education biology is a world whose landscapes are shaped by (re)productions of historical, cultural, and social norms. We explore these norms through the lens of identity, asking what identities are recognized by university biology teachers at a large Swedish university, analyzing 94 teaching statements written when applying for faculty positions in biology. We argue that in and through teaching statements, university biology teachers negotiate and perform overarching academic and disciplinary norms and discourses with the goal to present themselves as intelligible candidates. As statements of value, they thereby display implicit and explicit identities recognized in worlds of higher education biology. Using a discourse analytical framework, we identified two university teacher identities imagined as intelligible: Research Science Teachers and Facilitating Science Teachers. Research Science Teachers position research and associated masculine-coded competences as anchor points of biology practice. They consider researchers to be ultimate knowers and consequently to be best suitable for university teaching with the goal to recruit students into research. Facilitating Science Teachers, even though aware of the hegemonic position of research, disentangle imaginaries of what makes a researcher from what makes a university teacher. They transgress dominant imaginaries of research as the ultimate competence for themselves and students, and create spaces for alternative identity work. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of (re)productive processes in science education, providing perspectives of how to together infract intergenerational (re)productions of hegemonic norms of doing science. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that higher education biology is not a gender-neutral higher education landscape.",2023,,Journal of Research in Science Teaching,60,6,1195-1222,2890042367; EJ1385116,https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21829,,#210,Günter 2023,"",""
Perceived Social Norms and Acceptance of Transgender Students in Gendered Restrooms,"Monheim, Chelsea L.; Ratcliff, Jennifer J.","Transgender college students report higher rates of discrimination in gendered restrooms than do their cisgender peers. It is critical to understand factors that promote greater acceptance of transgender students using restrooms that align with their gender identity. The current experiment examined the impact of perceived social norms on both acceptance of transgender individuals using various locations and transphobia. Participants were 133 cisgender college students recruited on a college campus that had recently added all-gender restrooms to all campus buildings. Participants completed a prescreening measure of transphobia. During the experimental session, participants read results from a fictional study in which the social norm of their college campus was described as either in favor of (supportive norm) or against (unsupportive norm) the installation of all-gender restrooms on campus. Then participants completed measures of acceptance of transgender individuals in various spaces and transphobia. Supporting the primary hypothesis, relative to those in the unsupportive norm condition, participants in the supportive social norm condition were more accepting of transgender individuals using restrooms that aligned with their gender identity. However, the norm manipulation did not impact personal levels of transphobia between prescreen and post experimental manipulation.

Improving Social Belonging to Increase Success in an Online Doctorate Program,"Rost, Jim; Krahenbuhl, Kevin","Institutions of higher education have long been plagued with difficulty in overcoming the high rates of incompletion of candidates who enroll in doctoral programs. As we continue to move through the post-pandemic era, online course delivery in doctoral programs continues to rise which brings an added layer of difficulty for EdD students to persist beyond their required coursework in the online environment (Rockinson-Szapkiw et al., 2019). As a result, it is incumbent upon online EdD program directors and faculty to not only identify barriers to online doctoral student success, but to also find solutions. In summer of 2020, a regional state university in the southeast accepted its inaugural class of doctoral students into a new higher education concentration of their existing on-ground K-12 EdD program. During the past few years between the program's original design and inception, faculty have been examining factors related to doctoral student belongingness, from initial coursework through dissertation completion. Moreover, in 2021, the institution was fortunate to be admitted into the Carnegie Program on the Education Doctorate (CPED) consortium and as a result, has worked to adopt the CPED framework for EdD program design and application. It is through this new lens that the faculty at this institution have identified some lessons to share in pursuit of high rates of success while maintaining a demand of excellence in their work. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to use the newly designed Higher Education EdD program as a baseline case study towards improved online program student success.",2023,,Impacting Education: Journal on Transforming Professional Practice,8,1,44-48,2844905102; EJ1381875,,,#213,Rost 2023,"",""
Persisting in Physics and the Physics Olympiad--Impact of Gender Identification and Sense of Belonging on Expectancy-Value Outcomes,"Ladewig, Antonia; Köller, Olaf; Neumann, Knut","The German Physics Olympiad is an extracurricular science contest for students. Here, they have the opportunity to compete against other talented students, can do physics outside of school, and take a first step to more engagement in the domain. Yet, female students participate in the competition in fewer numbers and are disproportionally more likely to drop out of the contest earlier than the male students. The present study hence explored the question to which extent the German Physics Olympiad provides a threatening environment for female contestants' intentions of persisting in physics. A total of 298 participants (28% female) were surveyed with respect to stereotype and social identity threat, as well as gender identification and sense of belonging as predictors of success expectations for and value of choosing to study physics. Success expectations and value of choosing to study physics were used as a measure for career intentions within the expectancy-value model. The results support the conclusion that the contest presents an equally supporting environment for female and male participants. We found no gender differences in success expectations for and value of studying physics. Sense of belonging and gender identification significantly predicted success expectations but not value of choosing to study physics. Female participants in the German Physics Olympiad were also neither affected by stereotype threat nor by social identity threat in their sense of belonging or gender identification.",2023,,European Journal of Psychology of Education,38,1,435-454,2794748167; EJ1364105,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10212-022-00600-5,,#215,Ladewig 2023,"",""

Through the narrative inquiry approach, I explored teachers 'professional identity development using Gee's (2000) identity framework. The data revealed that hierarchy and power relations between the teachers and the social context fundamentally shaped teacher identity development. However, the study further showed that professional hierarchy was not uni-layered, the power was not one-directional, and the domination was not permanent but rather dynamic. Factors like academic qualifications, job status, technological skills, and social status made the hierarchy complex. More interestingly, hierarchical relationships did not always undermine teacher empowerment but confidence in some cases. For example, when a teacher in a marginalized position due to some factors such as poor health condition was viewed as a role model or capable of success despite challenges, they achieved high value from their colleagues.",2023,,Online Submission,5,1,1-20,2794732374; ED626429,,,#216,Subedi 2023,"",""
When Probabilities Are Not Enough--A Framework for Causal Explanations of Student Success Models,"Cohausz, Lea","Student success and drop-out predictions have gained increased attention in recent years, connected to the hope that by identifying struggling students, it is possible to intervene and provide early help and design programs based on patterns discovered by the models. Though by now many models exist achieving remarkable accuracy-values, models outputting simple probabilities are not enough to achieve these ambitious goals. In this paper, we argue that they can be a first exploratory step of a pipeline aiming to be capable of reaching the mentioned goals. By using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as SHAP and LIME, we can understand what features matter for the model and make the assumption that features important for successful models are also important in real life. By then additionally connecting this with an analysis of counterfactuals and a theory-driven causal analysis, we can begin to reasonably understand not just ""if"" a student will struggle but ""why"" and provide fitting help. We evaluate the pipeline on an artificial dataset to show that it can, indeed, recover complex causal mechanisms and on a real-life dataset showing the method's applicability. We further argue that collaborations with social scientists are mutually beneficial in this area but also discuss the potential negative effects of personal intervention systems and call for careful designs.",2022,,Journal of Educational Data Mining,14,3,52-75,2861332762; EJ1373139,,,#217,Cohausz 2022,"",""

Ten participants (n=10) were recruited from a college outdoor education programme this consisted of 6 male (n=6) age range 18-26 and 4 Females (n=4) age range, 18-27. The research followed a constructivist emergent approach. Semi-structured schedule guided the interviews but was open to emerging issues and involved a reflexive process where habitus became a tool around which to organise the research and the analysis. Two main themes emerged from the analysis: 'Gender, identity and formative experience' and 'Capital and access to the cultural field'. For 'Gender, identity and formative experience' there were sub themes: 'Masculinity, identity and place'; 'Femininity, identity and social space'; Challenging the gendered orthodoxy' and Women managing their identities'. 'Capital and access to the social field' deals with access to the cultural field of higher education and outdoor education. For the young men early experiences in the family establishes the masculine orthodoxy and cultural capital valued by the cultural field. Women provide a complex and contradictory accounts of their identity construction. Challenging the gendered orthodoxy often comes with a cost to their feminine capital and status. 'Capital and access to the social field' deals with access to the cultural field of higher education and outdoor education. Students from non-traditional backgrounds develop strategies based on their previous experiences to negotiate their learning identities. Students from traditional backgrounds are responsive to emerging opportunities where families provide optimal conditions for their seamless transition to higher education.

Not Feeling Recognized as a Physics Person by Instructors and Teaching Assistants Is Correlated with Female Students' Lower Grades,"Cwik, Sonja; Singh, Chandralekha","Student motivational beliefs in introductory physics courses can influence their course outcomes as well as their retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines and future career aspirations. Prior research has shown that students' perceived recognition by others as a physics person is important in predicting their physics identity and career choices. This study used validated survey data from 827 students in the first of two college algebra-based introductory physics courses primarily taken by bioscience majors, in which women make up approximately 67% of the class. We investigated how the students' perceived recognition by instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) as a physics person predicts their grade at the end of a mandatory physics course for bioscience majors in which women are not outnumbered by men. We found that overall women had lower perceived recognition than men as a physics person and their perceived recognition played an important role in predicting course grades controlling for high school GPA and math SAT scores. Since physics as a discipline presents a barrier to women due to deep-rooted societal stereotypes and biases about who can excel in it, the numerical representation of women alone in these courses does not imply that they will feel recognized by their instructors and TAs as a physics person without an intentional effort to make the learning environment equitable and inclusive.

While we found similar rates of change in self-efficacy and science identity for all groups, females and PEER students had lower initial scores that failed to ""catch up"" to male and non-PEER scores by the end of the year. Students grouped into either high and stable or lower and decreasing trajectories for scientific community values, with first-generation college students overrepresented in the latter group. Additionally, we found no evidence for intersectionality of subgroups. We did find evidence that the relationship between gender and PEER status and science identity is likely mediated via self-efficacy.

Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The study was shaped by the following questions: (1) How is ""successful"" support of a transgender child defined by the educators who worked with a child as her gender identity and expression changed? (2) What were the educators' strategies for facilitating the student's in-school transition? (3) What (if any) actions were taken to recognize or affirm gender diversity?

Participants: Interview participants were school personnel, including administrators, teachers, and counselors, who worked in the school while the child was in kindergarten through third grade, and the student's mother. Research Design: Eleven interviews were conducted. Limited observation included a school assembly focused on learning to accept differences and observation of gendered images throughout the school building.

The study is drawn upon an empirical life-history exploration of three women: a native to Northwestern Europe, late-career white woman and two immigrant women to Northwestern Europe, one is an undergraduate student of color, and the other, an early career Muslim woman. The data for this study were collected through multiple, semistructured, interviews in a period of 2 years, which were analyzed using a constant comparative method. Collectively, the three life-histories tell stories of otherness, persistence, hope, and failure and they elucidate the kinds of identities that are deemed ""in-place"" and ""out-of-place"" in physics. They showcase how the three women authored multiple identities that simply co-existed for them, while for others were seen as conflicting and caused misrecognition. The findings point to four main insights: (a) recognition is neither linear nor binary and it comes in many different forms that range from explicit encouragement to no opposition; (b) it is drawn upon various sources including ones in the early years of life: family, school teachers, university instructor, students, and social community; (c) it is culture-dependent and as such, it is influenced by factors on multiple levels, including cultural and gender stereotypes, organizational policies, racism, sexism, classicism, and other forms of discrimination. The implications of these findings speak to the need for: (a) systemic programs on how women are recognized by others and which seek to widen and diversify physics environments from the school level to the professional level; (b) research exploration of the politics of recognition and how they perpetuate the underrepresentation of women in physics; and, (c) disrupting monolithic theorizations of recognition and adopting intersectional approaches to exploring physics identity that value women's personal histories, subjectivities, and positionalities.",2022,,Journal of Research in Science Teaching,59,1,58-94,2642893895; EJ1319699,https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21721,,#232,Avraamidou 2022,"",""

We conducted two studies to investigate this possibility: (1) a narrative inquiry study with postsecondary transgender students and (2) a grounded theory narrative study with undergraduate queer students. Transgender students who had transitioned indicated that they were subjected to lower expectations when presenting as female, but transgender women experienced this change as positive, since their treatment by others was no longer accompanied by gender dysphoria. Queer students experienced mathematics and other STEM fields as objective and independent of identity, yet simultaneously exclusionary of their queer identities. Many of the queer students in these studies found strength and resilience in queer communities, but there were some transgender women who did not view being queer as a central facet of their identity and did not feel the same sense of community. In general, those who were more gender-nonconforming felt a greater need for community with other queer people.

This module aimed to break the binary in misconceptions of both sex and gender, emphasising that both exist on separate spectra. Data triangulation was used to evaluate students' attitudes towards the module and their learning of module concepts. Students' attitudes were positive overall, and evaluation of students' learning indicated that the majority of students understood and retained key concepts, while also identifying common misconceptions. Perhaps the most important finding was that students who identified as belonging to a minority group had significantly more positive attitudes towards the module than non-minority students.

Motivation and Sense of Belonging in the Large Enrollment Introductory General and Organic Chemistry Remote Courses,"Cox, Charles T., Jr.; Stepovich, Nicole; Bennion, Alexandra; Fauconier, Jessie; Izquierdo, Nicole","The rapid shift from face-to-face to remote instruction in 2020 has resulted in recalibration of lecture and laboratory pedagogy. This research analyzed the impact of remote learning on student motivation and sense of belonging in large enrollment chemistry courses. Student responses were parsed according to specific demographics including gender, academic standing, first-generation status, and ethnicity. Research objectives included the analysis of how remote learning impacted specific demographics to develop guidelines for best practices moving forward for hybrid or online courses. Our findings show that second year students (sophomores) were the most impacted of the academic standing cohorts. Sophomores reported a statistically greater change in motivation after the start of the semester and statistically lower satisfaction with their performance on assignments. Females reported statistically lower motivation and a statistically lower sense of belonging in the course and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Black/African students reported a statistically lower motivation for remote learning than Asian/Pacific Islander and White/Caucasian students. Finally, both White/Caucasian and Black/African students reported a statistically lower sense of belonging in the course and in STEM fields than Asian/Pacific islander students. Finally, statistical differences were not observed based upon first-generation status. The research indicates that students were differentially impacted by the shift to remote learning.

Furthermore, secure attachment and anxious attachments predicted the cooperative learning style of students while anxious attachment and avoidant attachment predicted the competitive learning style of students. Further, a sense of belonging moderated not peer attachment and learning styles of students, while no significant differences were found between male and female students in terms of peer attachment, learning styles, and sense of belonging.

"Existing and Resisting: The Pedagogical Realities of Black, Critical Men and Women Faculty","Haynes, Chayla; Taylor, Leonard; Mobley, Steve D., Jr.; Haywood, Jasmine","The existing discourse highlighting Black faculty experiences in the classroom are largely hidden among studies that center the experiences of Faculty of Color who teach courses about race, gender, and/or diversity, regardless of their faculty status. And, even fewer of those studies unpack how their pedagogical approaches further complicate the experiences of Black faculty, especially Black faculty without tenure. The authors, who are Black hetero women and Black queer men, used embodied text as a framework to explore their teaching experiences as faculty and critical pedagogues. Where embodied text establishes the body as a site for learning and knowledge, critical pedagogy asserts that neither the classroom nor the knowledge constructed within that space are apolitical. The study findings illuminated how Black faculty bodies were scrutinized and ultimately showed that Black hetero women and Black queer men who were critical pedagogues embodied a resistance text that when read, oftentimes created intertextual pedagogical situations that invalidated their humanity. This research expands the scholarship on embodied text and critical pedagogy by examining the teaching experiences of Black faculty who not only centered critiques of power and privilege in non-diversity courses, but whose bodies were also disruptive in White, hetero, cis-patriarchal academic spaces.",2020,,Journal of Higher Education,91,5,698-721,2459000008; EJ1260648,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2020.1731263,,#259,Haynes 2020,"",""
Cultural Stereotypes and Sense of Belonging Contribute to Gender Gaps in STEM,"Master, Allison H.; Meltzoff, Andrew N.","There is a need to help more students succeed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, with particular interest in reducing current gender gaps in motivation and participation. We propose a new theoretical model, the STEreotypes, Motivation, and Outcomes (STEMO) developmental model, to account for and integrate recent data emerging in social and developmental psychology. Based on this model, we synthesize research suggesting that social factors, such as stereotypes and self-representations about ""belonging,"" are powerful contributors to observed gender differences in STEM interest and academic outcomes. The review has four parts. First, we examine how ""cultural stereotypes"" specific to STEM contribute to gender gaps by negatively impacting interest and academic outcomes. Second, we review the central role of the ""self-representations"" affected by those stereotypes, including the particular importance of a sense of belonging. Third, we discuss various ""interventions"" that buffer against stereotypes and enhance a sense of belonging to reduce gender gaps in STEM interest and academic outcomes. Finally, we suggest ""theory-driven directions"" for future research. By organizing the research in this way, our review and theoretical analysis clarify key factors contributing to current gender gaps in STEM and mechanisms by which psychological interventions can help address STEM gender gaps.",2020,,Grantee Submission,12,1,152-198,2458999056; ED605235,,,#260,Master 2020,"",""
Interanimating Black Sexualities and the Geography Classroom,"Eaves, LaToya E.","Why teach Black sexualities? How might Black lived sexualities provide students a more nuanced understanding of geography and place-making practices? The junctions of Blackness, sexuality, and place are understood as active processes that are being shaped and formed by and through power relations. This paper argues for centralizing the mutually constitutive nature of sexualities and Blackness, by troubling the normative notions of sexualities as commonly approached in curriculum and pedagogy. Focusing on Black sexualities is imperative, as Black lives, politics, and locations permeate the social order and can make visible the ways in which colonial legacies imbue global structures of dismissal, displacement, and erasure. Black sexualities are always personal and political, intermediating between systemic axes of oppression grounded in colonialism and imperialism and the agency of Black sex and sexual identities in spite of pathologizing structural components of society and space. As such, this paper considers the opportunities that Black sexualities offer in teaching and learning in the geography classroom. I consider the role of curricular choices, course discussions and assignments, and the pedagogy of embodiment. Embedded in a Black Geographies framework, I argue that centering a Black sense of place is essential to pedagogies of Black sexualities.",2020,,Journal of Geography in Higher Education,44,2,217-229,2458997213; EJ1258586,https://doi.org/10.1080/03098265.2020.1753029,,#261,Eaves 2020,"",""
Learning That Physics Is 'Not for Me': Pedagogic Work and the Cultivation of Habitus among Advanced Level Physics Students,"Archer, Louise; Moote, Julie; MacLeod, Emily","Background: There is widespread agreement that participation in post-compulsory physics needs to be widened and increased, particularly among women and under-represented communities. This paper contributes to understanding of the processes that produce unequal participation, Methods: The paper undertakes a Bourdieusian analysis of longitudinal interview data from 75 interviews conducted with fifteen students, tracked from age 10-18, who studied Advanced level physics in England. Findings: The paper discusses evidence of a physics habitus that was strongly aligned with notions of intelligence/cleverness and masculinity and identifies how young women were particularly disadvantaged by a popular notion of the ""effortlessly clever physicist"", which encouraged even highly interested and high attaining young women not to continue further with the subject. We identified three main forms of pedagogic work performed by school physics (attainment-based practices of debarring and gatekeeping; curriculum practices of deferring 'real' physics and physics 'lies'; and interpersonal reinforcement of doxa), which helped cultivate student habitus over time and produce inequitable patterns of participation Contribution: Analyses show that school physics contributes to reproducing inequitable (and low overall) patterns of participation.

Developing a Feminist Identity among Elite Female Students in a Chinese University: A Qualitative Study,"Zheng, Jiaran","The aim of this study is to investigate the forms, significance and effects of feminist identity development among elite young women in a Chinese university environment. Based on fieldwork conducted over 11 months in a Chinese public university with a predominately male student body, this study explores the gendered experiences of eight female student leaders. It finds that there is a contradiction in the participants' identity construction process. On the one hand, these young Chinese women construct a collective identity which is both distant from an elite identity and conforms to several traditional or dominant discourses. On the other hand, they resort to individual efforts to realise their life aspirations rather than participating in collective feminist movements. Such ways of identity construction and the presence of such a significant contradiction can point to the new space and future direction for young women struggling to achieve gender equality in China. Drawing on psychological and sociological theories in feminist studies, this study suggests that participants are actively involving themselves in global feminisms to realise their individual dreams.

Assessing the Diversity-Related Professional Development Needs of Pre-Service Teachers,"Toms, Ozalle Marie; Reddig, Kim; Jones-Fosu, Stephanie","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the diversity-related professional development needs of pre-service teachers in our college. According to a report released in 2017 by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), minorities accounted for 20 per cent of all public elementary and secondary school teachers in the United States during the 2015-2016 school year. The same report noted that 51 per cent of all public elementary and secondary school students in the USA were nonwhite during the same school year. Schools will continue to become increasingly more diverse as it relates to the student population. Students of color are expected to make up 56 per cent of the student population by 2024 (Digest of Education Statistics, 2013). With the changing demographics of US schools, pre-service teachers must be prepared to teach, interact and support students and families whose cultures, beliefs and lifestyles may differ from their own. Cultural competence is having an awareness of one's own cultural identity perceptions and views about difference, and the ability to learn and build on the varying cultural and community norms of students and their families (Muñoz and Graybill, 2015). The mere presence of diverse communities on college campuses is not sufficient in promoting positive educational outcomes related to diversity (Museus, 2008). Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative survey research was used to assess diversity related professional development needs of pre-service teachers. Students were asked an open-ended question: 'Please list topics of diversity training that should be offered to students in the college' After the question, a text box was provided to allow respondents to provide a unique answer. This approach, as opposed to providing a list of predetermined responses to select from gave respondents the freedom to say exactly what they felt should be offered. Findings: After analyzing the 163 open-ended responses provided by students six themes emerged. The themes were offering diversity-related professional development in the areas of disability/mental illness, cultural competence/awareness, LGBTQAI+/gender, facilitating conversations about diversity, discrimination and race/ethnicity. Research limitations/implications: The sample came from one university; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other predominantly white universities. Future research should collect data at other universities or the schools within the university system to determine the needs for other campuses. The results of such a study will always be limited in scope but they do describe the needs at the targeted University. The response rate was low, 24 per cent. The reasons for the low response rate are unclear. Other survey techniques, such as mail surveys or face-to-face meetings, may be more successful in obtaining a higher response rate. Practical implications: Teacher preparation programs should assess students' perceptions, knowledge and experiences as it relates to diversity, and survey pre-service teachers to determine gaps in the diversity training currently being offered. Diversity training must be intentional to prepare pre-service teachers to meet the demands of the diverse classroom. Social implications: Future research should aim to assess pre-service teachers' beliefs about diversity throughout the entirety of teacher preparation programs by assessing pre-service teachers in multiple classes and participants who attend independent diversity training opportunities. To address the rapid increase in cultural and ethnic diversity in education worldwide, pre-service programs should target and challenge pre-service teachers' beliefs to assure equitable education to diverse students.

Following the virtual experience, women in the pSTEM condition differed significantly from women in the humanities condition regarding pSTEM value beliefs, anticipated stereotype threat, course motivation, and women-pSTEM implicit associations, after controlling for prior pSTEM-self implicit associations. However, this difference only occurred among women who identified with the experience.

How Not to Scare off Women: Different Needs of Female Early-Stage Researchers in STEM and SSH Fields and the Implications for Support Measures,"Cidlinská, Katerina","Women researchers are underrepresented in almost all research fields. There are disciplinary differences in the phase in which they tend to quit their academic career: in the natural and technical sciences (STEM), it is in the postdoctoral phase, whereas in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) it is during the doctoral phase. This is indicative of disciplinary differences in the barriers women face in their careers. Related studies on these barriers are more numerous in the STEM field, which in turn limits the scope of potential policies and measures that address the needs of women in the SSH field. This article aspires to contribute to an understanding of the obstacles women from different fields face in their careers and to offer a reflection on various support measures. Using qualitative data (interviews, focus groups, workshop notes, evaluation forms) from a Czech mentoring programme for female junior researchers across all fields, the subsequent analysis reveals disciplinary differences in the perceived career path obstacles in research as well as the attitudes held towards it. Furthermore, the analysis points to the reasons for these obstacles and attitudes by using the concept of professional identity, a useful tool for identifying the barriers to the development of professional career ambitions. Additionally, the analysis utilises Becher and Trowler's categorisation of SSH and STEM fields into rural and urban categories, enabling one to reflect on the social, cognitive and power features of these fields and the influence these features have on the conditions for the start of an academic career. In order to motivate women to complete their PhD and to apply for a job in academia, this article argues that measures should be taken in the SSH field to promote the involvement of women in the academic community right from the start of their PhD, and therefore, along with mentoring, sponsorship is also needed. In the natural and technical sciences, it is crucial to present women in the late doctoral and early postdoctoral phase with positive female role models -- not as token superstars, but as young researchers who are just a few career steps ahead and who have managed to balance their career with a family in the frame of an egalitarian partnership. Furthermore, it is necessary to increase the gender sensitivity of these female researchers in order to prevent feelings of scientific inefficacy arising from the discrepancy between their own intended biography and priorities, and the normative notion of the ""proper"" scientist, which is strongly masculine instead of gender-neutral. Recommendations are also included for transforming this normative notion of the ""proper scientist"" -- a precondition for wider structural changes within the entire academic environment -- into a more gender-neutral one.",2019,,Higher Education: The International Journal of Higher Education Research,78,2,365-388,2461136595; EJ1222188,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-018-0347-x,,#266,Cidlinská 2019,"",""

Peer-familiarity context (i.e., who the bystander knows in the situation) can play a role in bystander intervention, but researchers have not explored the nature of bystander intervention in specific peer-familiarity contexts concerning LGBT discrimination. Using hypothetical vignettes, we examine heterosexual students' (n = 1616) intention to intervene across 4 peer-familiarity contexts, namely, when the bystander knows no one, only witnesses or targets, only perpetrator, or everyone. We explore the role of student inputs (sociodemographics, self-esteem, attitudes toward LGBT people and political ideology) and experiences (LGBT social contacts, LGBT and social justice course content, and perceived and experienced campus climate) on their intentions to intervene in these contexts. Multiple regression results suggest that across all peer-familiarity contexts, being older, having higher self-esteem, having LGBT friends, taking courses with social justice content, and affirming attitudes toward LGBT people were independently associated with higher intentions to intervene. Males were more likely than females to intervene when they knew no one, while females were more likely to intervene in all other contexts.

Beauvoir's ideology focuses mainly on the cultural mechanisms of oppression which cause to confine women under the title of Other to man's self. In her view woman cannot be a simple biological category, and she asserts that womanhood is imposed on woman by civilization. In her idea, the fundamental social meaning of woman is Other. She believes that biology is the main source for woman's oppression within patriarchal society, and challenges the discourse through which women are defined based on her biology. She also believes that sexuality is another aspect of women's oppression and exploitation and all functions of women. In Beauvoir's view, prostitution and heterosexuality are exploitation of woman. She rejects the heterosexuality as the norm for sexual relations. This paper tries to show how Atwood in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" speculates feminist issues such as loss of identity, subordination of woman in a male dominated society and women's exploitation in consumer society where woman's body is treated as an object, a tool and consumable item.

Hierarchical regression findings indicated teacher support and structure influenced young adolescents' school functioning after controlling for prior adjustment, and that gender moderated associations. Teacher respect was related with involved behavior, and expectations were related with intrinsic value, belonging, and achievement. As expected, high levels of perceived support and structure were associated with higher levels of intrinsic value, involved behavior, and school belonging.

Student Evaluations of Physics Teachers: On the Stability and Persistence of Gender Bias,"Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra","There is a long history of research which confounds the simple interpretation that evaluations in an educational context are purely measures of competency. One such issue is that of gender bias in student evaluations of their teachers. In our prior work, we found that male students underrated female high school teachers in biology and chemistry while all students underrated female high school teachers in physics. In the current work, we independently checked and extended this earlier work to examine the effect of physics identity on student evaluations and gender bias. Employing multiple regression on survey data from a representative sample of 6772 college students across the U.S., attending both 2-year and 4-year post-secondary institutions (including STEM and non-STEM majors), we find the core physics effect is unchanged despite a gap between studies of nearly 10 years. Namely, both male and female students underrate their female high school physics teachers, even after controlling for physics grades and classroom experiences. Our new focus on physics identity reveals that students with a strong physics identity show a larger gender bias in favor of male teachers than those with less of a physics identity. These results may help to explain how structures that privilege certain groups and marginalize others are prevalent amongst the youngest members of a defined physics community and may serve to uphold the status quo as these young members traverse to higher levels of physics community membership. Furthermore, biased evaluative feedback structures may be one of the propagators of women's lower competency beliefs in physics, a result that has been found by many prior studies.

Marriage and Family: LGBT Individuals and Same-Sex Couples,"Gates, Gary J.","Though estimates vary, as many as 2 million to 3.7 million U.S. children under age 18 may have a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender parent, and about 200,000 are being raised by same-sex couples. Much of the past decade's legal and political debate over allowing same-sex couples to marry has centered on these couples' suitability as parents, and social scientists have been asked to weigh in. After carefully reviewing the evidence presented by scholars on both sides of the issue, Gary Gates concludes that same-sex couples are as good at parenting as their different-sex counterparts. Any differences in the wellbeing of children raised in same-sex and different-sex families can be explained not by their parents' gender composition but by the fact that children being by raised by same-sex couples have, on average, experienced more family instability, because most children being raised by same-sex couples were born to different-sex parents, one of whom is now in the same-sex relationship. That pattern is changing, however. Despite growing support for same-sex parenting, proportionally fewer same-sex couples report raising children today than in 2000. Why? Reduced social stigma means that more LGBT people are coming out earlier in life. They're less likely than their LGBT counterparts from the past to have different-sex relationships and the children such relationships produce. At the same time, more same-sex couples are adopting children or using reproductive technologies like artificial insemination and surrogacy. Compared to a decade ago, same-sex couples today may be less likely to have children, but those who do are more likely to have children who were born with same-sex parents who are in stable relationships. In the past, most same-sex couples raising children were in a cohabiting relationship. With same-sex couples' right to marry now secured throughout the country, the situation is changing rapidly. As more and more same-sex couples marry, Gates writes, we have the opportunity to consider new research questions that can contribute to our understanding of how marriage and parental relationships affect child wellbeing.",2015,,Future of Children,25,2,67-87,1773231197; EJ1079373,,,#294,Gates 2015,"",""

How Gender Differences in Academic Engagement Relate to Students' Gender Identity,"Kessels, Ursula; Heyder, Anke; Latsch, Martin; Hannover, Bettina","Background: Gender differences in educational outcomes encompass many different areas. For example, in some educational settings, boys lag behind girls on indicators of educational success, such as leaving certificates and type of school attended. In studies testing performance, boys typically show lower competence in reading compared with girls, yet tend to show higher competence in school subjects related to mathematics. While such differences in competence between the genders can be relatively small, they coincide with much greater differences in motivation-related variables emerging during the school years, and thus seem to channel students into lifelong gendered pathways via gendered educational and occupational preferences. Purpose: From a psychological perspective, we propose the ""Interests as Identity Regulation Model"" (IIRM) as a useful tool for understanding many of the gender differences in educational outcomes. Specifically, the focus is on two areas of research: girls' and women's under-representation in subjects such as maths and science; and boys' lower engagement at school in general. Sources of evidence: Findings from recent research, mostly from a psychological perspective using quantitative measures and empirical studies testing the IIRM, are reported to illustrate different aspects of the interplay between students' gender identity and gendered social meanings of academic domains (such as maths), as well as academic engagement in general. Main argument: IIRM suggests that the perceived fit between students' gender identity and the gendered social meanings associated with different possible behaviours at school (e.g. choosing a subject, investing effort or not) is a relevant heuristic for students' directing of their learning activities. The male stereotyping of maths and science implies a greater misfit between girls' gender identity and engagement in these domains. The perception that displaying effort and engagement at school is feminine leads to a misfit between boys' gender identity and academic engagement in general. Conclusions: Attempts to alleviate gender differences in educational outcomes that channel students into lifelong gendered pathways with regard to qualifications and occupations will benefit from an understanding of how closely these academic choices are related to students' gender identity. Interventions should aim at enhancing the individually perceived fit between a student's gender identity and engagement in specific subjects or learning activities. The nature of such interventions will be an important topic of future research.",2014,,Educational Research,56,2,220-229,1651838770; EJ1024903,https://doi.org/10.1080/00131881.2014.898916,,#302,Kessels 2014,"",""
What Do I Want to Be with My PhD? The Roles of Personal Values and Structural Dynamics in Shaping the Career Interests of Recent Biomedical Science PhD Graduates,"Gibbs, Kenneth D., Jr.; Griffin, Kimberly A.","Interest in faculty careers decreases as graduate training progresses; however, the process underlying career-interest formation remains poorly defined. To better understand this process and whether/how it differs across social identity (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender), we conducted focus groups with 38 biomedical scientists who received PhDs between 2006 and 2011, including 23 women and 18 individuals from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. Objective performance and quality of advisor relationships were not significantly different between scientists with high versus low interest in faculty careers. Career interests were fluid and formed in environments that generally lacked structured career development. Vicarious learning shaped similar outcome expectations about academic careers for all scientists; however, women and URMs recounted additional, distinct experiences and expectations. Scientists pursuing faculty careers described personal values, which differed by social identity, as their primary driver. For scientists with low interest in faculty careers, a combination of values, shared across social identity, and structural dynamics of the biomedical workforce (e.g., job market, grant funding, postdoc pay, etc.) played determinative roles.

The Impact of Engineering Identification and Stereotypes on Undergraduate Women's Achievement and Persistence in Engineering,"Jones, Brett D.; Ruff, Chloe; Paretti, Marie C.","Women almost always comprise a minority in engineering programs and a smaller percentage of women pursue engineering than other science and technology majors. The culture of engineering departments and negative stereotypes of women's engineering and mathematical ability have been identified as factors that inhibit women's entry into engineering and cause them to leave the major. Even for women who stay, stereotype threat or the anxiety of confirming a negative stereotype can decrease academic performance. To more fully understand this dynamic, we examined four factors associated with stereotype threat (engineering identification, gender identification, gender stereotype endorsement, and engineering ability perceptions) to determine how they impacted women's achievement and persistence in engineering at the end of their first year of an engineering program. Participants included 363 first-year general engineering students from a large public university. Students completed a questionnaire near the end of their first year. Results indicated that there were differences between men and women for gender stereotype endorsement and engineering ability perceptions, with men more likely to hold negative stereotypes of women's engineering abilities and women more likely to report higher perceptions of their engineering abilities. Engineering identification was a significant predictor of persistence in engineering, and engineering ability perceptions were significant predictors of achievement; the relationships were stronger for women than men. The fact that neither gender identification nor gender stereotype endorsement were related to achievement or persistence in engineering indicated that they were less important factors for first-year women engineering students than engineering identification and engineering ability perceptions.",2013,,Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal,16,3,471-493,1651866607; EJ1039388,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11218-013-9222-x,,#306,Jones 2013,"",""
Factors Leading African Americans and Black Caribbeans to Use Social Work Services for Treating Mental and Substance Use Disorders,"Cheng, Tyrone C.; Robinson, Michael A.","This secondary analysis of 5,000 African Americans and black Caribbeans explored how their use of social work services to address mental and substance use disorders was associated with the disorder involved as well as their perceived need for services, belief system, family resources, proximity to services, social-structural factors, and demographic characteristics. The sample was extracted from a national data set. Results of multinomial logistic regression showed that use of social work services was increased by dual diagnosis, substance use disorder alone, and mental disorder alone; by deteriorating mental health; by perceived stigma in treatment use; by welfare receipt and insurance coverage for mental health services; and by college graduation. Results also showed that use of services outside social work was promoted by dual diagnosis, substance use disorder alone, and mental disorder alone; by deteriorating mental health; by experience of racial discrimination; by insurance coverage for mental health services; by college education or graduation; and by female gender and increasing age.

"Teen Girls, Working-Class Femininity and Resistance: Retheorising Fantasy and Desire in Educational Contexts of Heterosexualised Violence","Ringrose, Jessica; Renold, Emma","This paper challenges post-feminist discourses and recuperative masculinity politics in education that have evoked mythical constructions of the successful ""achieving"" girl in ways that flatten out social and cultural difference and render invisible ongoing gendered and sexualised inequalities and violence in the social worlds of schools and beyond. We map how girls negotiate contradictory neo-liberal discourses of girlhood that dominate in popular culture; what McRobbie calls the new ""post-feminist masquerade"", which portends that girls can be/come anything they want, so long as they simultaneously perform ""hyper-sexy"", the new aspirational feminine ideal. Drawing on individual case studies from four qualitative research projects with teen girls in urban and rural working class communities across England and Wales, we explore how specific ""working-class"" girls struggle to negotiate this contradictory terrain of girlhood through imaginary ""lines of flight"" in their narratives. Specifically, we are interested in applying Deleuze and Guatarri's writings on immanence and the productive, social status of desire and fantasy through an analysis of girls' (violent, aggressive or utopian) fantasies in ways that move beyond the binary of ""real/not real"", and thus reject a reading of fantasy as futile, ""escapist"" or ""pathological solutions to working class life"".

We first review poststructuralist theories of language, subjectivity, and positioning and explain sociocultural theories of language learning. We then discuss constructs of ""INVESTMENT"" and ""IMAGINED COMMUNITIES/IMAGINED IDENTITIES"" (Norton Peirce 1995; Norton 1997, 2000, 2001), showing how these have been used by diverse identity researchers. Illustrative examples of studies that investigate how identity categories like race, gender, and sexuality interact with language learning are discussed. Common qualitative research methods used in studies of identity and language learning are presented, and we review the research on identity and language teaching in different regions of the world. We examine how digital technologies may be affecting language learners' identities, and how learner resistance impacts language learning.

Growing Boys: Implementing a Boys' Empowerment Group in an Afterschool Program,"Hall, Georgia; Charmaraman, Linda","The process of establishing a healthy male identity can be difficult for many boys. The limited definitions of masculinity available to boys and men are generally characterized by competition, repression of fear and emotion, and physical and emotional strength. Boys of color and those of lower economic status tend to encounter even fewer healthy alternatives for defining their maleness than do their white and better-off counterparts. Boys who need support in choosing positive and healthy pathways could benefit from an intervention that gives them space and time to share information, to work and play cooperatively, and to grow healthy identities. While inclusive grouping is an important part of building community in a youth development program, common-interest groups such as girls' or boys' empowerment groups can help members grow and support one another. In this article, the authors describe the results of a case study they conducted of one such group, an afterschool empowerment group for middle school boys. Using elements of ethnographic study, the authors examined participants' reactions to the work they did together in the empowerment group and explored the characteristics that made the group leaders effective in facilitating that work. The authors' goal was to discover how a boys' empowerment group could help participants avoid risky behaviors such as joining a gang or engaging in interpersonal violence, while instead making healthier choices that could lead to positive growth. Their findings on the benefits of participation in a boys' empowerment group suggest that these steps are valuable and worthwhile. Boys in the empowerment group they studied lived daily in a delicate balance between safety and harm across a host of domains--physical, emotional, social, academic. The authors saw some of them experience dramatic changes in their attitudes toward school and relationships. When a boys' empowerment group is done right--and has the right leadership--it can change lives.",2011,,Afterschool Matters,,13,49-51,1140140826; EJ980179,,,#310,Hall 2011,"",""
Charting a Way Forward: Intersections of Race and Space in Establishing Identity as an African-Canadian Teacher Educator,"McNeil, Barbara","In Canada, most universities and their classrooms are often constructed as rational and neutral spaces where interaction between professors and students is free of the influences of race, class, and gender. Implicit in such a construction is the assumption that the university is a purely White space where students from the dominant racial group expect the professorate to be of similar race. The presence of a non-White teacher educator in such an environment disrupts such fictional constructions, generating tensions and resistance that complicate teaching and learning. This self-study describes my experience as an African-Canadian teacher educator and the intersections of race and space in a faculty of education landscape enmeshed in an ongoing struggle of decolonization. Along with self-study methodology, I use critical race theory and feminist post-structural theory to analyze the construction of my racial identity and relations of power in a White settler society. I explore how the intersection of race and space in my identity formation can be used to understand how my students are produced historically and culturally. The self-study provides insights into the production of teacher, student, and institution identities in a racialized place.

The data show that the majority of boys and girls support dominant gender norms, but there is some indication of fluidity.

"White, Male, and ""Minority"": Racial Consciousness among White Male Undergraduates Attending a Historically Black University","Peterson, R. Darrell; Hamrick, Florence A.","Enrollments of non-Black students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have recently increased to the point that 11% of all undergraduate students enrolled in HBCUs in 2001 were White (U. S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2004). Accelerated transdemographic enrollment patterns (Brown) at a number of public HBCUs have resulted as HBCUs grapple with simultaneous pressures to increase student enrollments (including enrollments of non-Black students), strengthen or maintain institutional quality, and clarify the contemporary functions of the HBCU. At the same time, White males in the U.S. represent the race and gender group that is most privileged economically and socially; yet White males are arguably more disadvantaged with respect to developing as racial and gendered beings due to the socialization, entitlement, and privilege bestowed upon them within society. Very little research examines the racial consciousness aspects of identity development of White students attending HBCUs where issues of race, gender, privilege, and power can intersect for students in ways that have not been systematically explored. This study aims to explore the White racial consciousness (WRC) among full-time, White male undergraduates attending a public, predominantly Black HBCU. Specifically, this study sought to understand how these students, as ""temporary minority"" students (Hall & Clossen, 2005), made meaning of their collegiate experiences in terms of WRC. The findings of this study illustrate how the participants' various environments interacted, converged, or remained isolated, and ultimately helped inform their perspectives and opinions about race--reinforcing Hartigan's (1999) emphasis on the salience of local settings to race and racial beliefs.

Women farmers reported the kinds of knowledge and information they want, in what kinds of contexts, and through what means of communication.

Methods: The author conducted linear regression analyses of energy-drink consumption frequencies on sociodemographic characteristics, jock identity, masculine norms, and risk-taking behavior. Results: Of participants, 39% consumed an energy drink in the past month, with more frequent use by men (2.49 d/month) than by women (1.22 d/month). Strength of jock identity was positively associated with frequency of energy-drink consumption; this relationship was mediated by both masculine norms and risk-taking behavior. Conclusions: Sport-related identity, masculinity, and risk taking are components of the emerging portrait of a toxic jock identity, which may signal an elevated risk for health-compromising behaviors.

This study examines adolescent social networks predicting suicide ideation and attempt trajectories transitioning to adulthood, while revealing differences across racial/ethnic, sex, sexual identity, and socioeconomic status. Methods: Participants included 9421 high school students (Mage = 15.30 years; 54.58% females, baseline) from Waves I–IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, 1994–2008. Latent class growth analyses were conducted to identify suicide ideation and attempt trajectories. Multivariate multinomial logistic regressions examined the relationships between social network characteristics during adolescence and suicidal trajectories. Interaction terms between social networks and sociodemographic characteristics were included to test moderation effects. Results: Three suicidal ideation trajectories (low-stable, high-decreasing, moderate-decreasing-increasing) and two suicide attempt trajectories (low-stable, moderate-decreasing) were identified. Greater family cohesion significantly reduced the probability of belonging to high-decreasing (Trajectory 2) and moderate-decreasing-increasing (Trajectory 3) suicidal ideation trajectories, and moderate-decreasing (Trajectory 2) suicide attempt trajectory. Race/ethnicity, sex, and sexual identity significantly moderated the associations between social networks (household size, peer network density, family cohesion, peer support, neighborhood support) and suicidal trajectories. Conclusions: Social networks during adolescence influenced the odds of belonging to distinct suicidal trajectories. Family cohesion protected youth from being in high-risk developmental courses of suicidal behaviors.

Climate control: The relationship between social identity threat and cues to an identity-safe culture,"Hall, William; Schmader, Toni; Aday, Audrey; Inness, Michelle; Croft, Elizabeth","Social identity threat has been proposed as a key contributor to the underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), but little research has sought to pinpoint naturally occurring contextual predictors of identity threat for women already training or working in STEM. The focus of the present research was to examine how cues to an identity-safe culture predict more or less positive interactions between men and women in STEM in ways that may trigger or minimize women’s daily experience of social identity threat. Specifically, we examined the role of inclusive organizational policies and/or greater female representation as 2 identity safety cues. In 2 daily diary studies of working engineers’ experiences, and in an experiment with undergraduate engineering students, we tested a model whereby cues to identity safety predict lower social identity threat for women in STEM, as mediated by having (or expecting to have) more positive interactions with male (but not female) colleagues. Results across each study and an internal meta-analysis of overall effects revealed that female engineers’ actual and anticipated daily experience of social identity threat was lower in organizations perceived to have more gender-inclusive policies (but was not consistently predicted by gender representation).

Contexts of social alcohol and cannabis use among sexual minority cisgender women and gender diverse individuals: Event-level differences in alcohol and cannabis use patterns based on the sexual orientations and gender identities of substance use companio,"Dyar, Christina; Dworkin, Emily R.; Kaysen, Debra","Purpose: Sexual minority women and gender diverse individuals assigned female at birth (SMWGD) are at elevated risk for alcohol and cannabis use disorders. It has been posited that characteristics of SMWGD’s substance use companions (i.e., sexual orientation, gender identity) may influence their own use, but few studies have tested this. The current study aimed to examine whether quantity and consequences of substance use varied based on sexual orientations and gender identities (SOGI) of SMWGD’s substance use companions. Methods: We utilized a 30-day ecological momentary assessment study of substance use among a sample of 429 SMWGD. We examined event-level associations between characteristics of substance use companions and quantity and consequences of substance use. Results: When SMWGD used alcohol/cannabis with most SOGI groups, they engaged in heavier drinking and cannabis use. Drinking with heterosexual men and SMW was associated with more drinking consequences. Drinking in settings with more SOGI groups and with both LGBTQ+ and heterosexual individuals was associated with heavier drinking and more consequences. Many contextual aspects of cannabis use settings predicted an increased likelihood of alcohol and cannabis co-use, while few contextual aspects of drinking settings were associated with co-use. Conclusion: Results suggest that SMWGD engage in heavier substance use when individuals from a range of SOGI groups are present, highlighting that heavy alcohol and cannabis use is not limited to use with SMW and nonbinary individuals. Drinking in setting with more SOGI groups present (e.g., parties and bars) appears to be associated with particularly heavy drinking and consequences.

Grasso et al.

Given broad investment in data-driven strategies with the rise of Electronic Health Records, scholars and advocates explain the observed missing data as an issue of poor implementation within sites of care. Such an explanation, however, deflects attention away from the upstream conditions that powerfully shape gender and sexual minority health inequities within biomedicine itself, including the content and breadth of clinical training, the location and scope of sites of care, and the diversity of the health professions workforce. Given these existing forms of biomedical stratification, data-driven strategies that prioritize counting patients over redressing structural conditions are unlikely to result in substantive social change. To advance health equity, we must do more than merely collect data: we must shift our analytic to consider the broader context in which health inequalities materialize.

"Disparities in social and economic determinants of health by sexual identity, gender, and age: Results from the 2015–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health","Schuler, Megan S.; Prince, Dana M.; Collins, Rebecca L.","Purpose: We characterize disparities between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults and heterosexual adults across multiple health determinants in a nationally representative sample. Methods: Data on 153,939 adults (including 11,133 LGB adults) were from the 2015–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Separate Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) that gay/lesbian and bisexual adults, respectively, experienced each health determinant, relative to heterosexual adults of the same gender and age group (ages 18–25, 26–34, 35–49, and 50–64). Statistically significant RR estimates were interpreted as a disparity. Results: Bisexual females exhibited disparities on all economic/health care access factors (no college degree, household poverty, means-tested assistance, unemployment, and lacking health insurance) across nearly all age groups; lesbian/gay females exhibited disparities in means-tested assistance and health insurance for some age groups. Notably fewer economic disparities were observed among gay and bisexual males. LGB adults (across identity, gender, and age group) were more likely to live alone, to have never been married, and to report low religious service attendance. Bisexual and lesbian/gay females, across age groups, had 1.7–2.2 times the risk of a lifetime arrest for a criminal offense, relative to same-age heterosexual females. Conclusions: Our results highlight that LGB females, particularly bisexual females, experience significant disparities in economic determinants of health, and all LGB subgroups exhibited disparities in some of the examined social determinants of health. The observed disparities, which spanned across age groups, likely contribute to disparities in physical and mental health observed among LGB adults.

Does my work matter? Reduced sense of mattering as a source of gender disparities,"Lombard, Ella J.; Cheryan, Sapna","Women may experience lower rates of entry and success into certain academic and professional spaces because of their observations that their work contributions are less valued than men's. We introduce sense of mattering as a mechanism that may help explain women's underrepresentation in male‐dominated fields and leadership roles, distinguish it from related constructs, and advance a theoretical framework for how sense of mattering may shape gender disparities. Women's professional contributions are often undervalued, and women perceive and anticipate this unfair disadvantage, which may in turn limit their success, retention, and representation in stereotypically masculine spaces and roles. Attending to sense of mattering has the potential to improve upon past attempts to reduce gender disparities by emphasizing the importance of increasing the extent to which women's contributions are recognized and valued.

Embodiment of social roles and thinness as a form of capital: A qualitative approach towards understanding female obesity disparities in Chile,"Robinovich, Jossiana; Ossa, Ximena; Baeza, Bernardita; Krumeich, Anja; van der Borne, Bart","Obesity in Chile disproportionately affects women of low socioeconomic status (SES). Research has shown that ideals of body size and differences in perceived social pressure for being slim across socioeconomic strata contribute to the social stratification of body size among women in modern societies. Thinness is most valued by high SES women, following western standards of ideal body size. Aiming to understand the link between ideals of body size and SES, this qualitative study explored how 36 Chilean women construct their bodily ideals according to their social position. A purposive sample of women with different profiles with regard to educational attainment, nutritional status and body size (dis)satisfaction was defined, aiming to cover a diverse spectrum of bodily perceptions. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and approached through a thematic and narrative analysis. Drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, capital and embodiment of the social context, this study explains how ideals of body size and appearance are strongly linked to class-dependent gender roles and social roles. The existing gender and class inequalities in the Chilean social structure have been literally embodied by these women through a ‘gendered class habitus’. Compliance with the thin ideal confers women different degrees of power according to their social position in different fields, such as in marriage and on the labour market, which turns thinness into an embodied form of capital. The societal dynamic behind obesity rates cannot be disregarded when approaching possible solutions. Promoting obesity-related lifestyle modification at an individual level might appear an over-simplistic and individualistic approach to a complex social issue. Context-oriented interventions that take cultural constructions of gender and social class into account might yield better results in the long term, while advocating for a more equitable society and social justice as a public health concern.

Gender equity and motivational readiness for computational thinking in early childhood,"Master, Allison; Tang, Daijiazi; Forsythe, Desiree; Alexander, Taylor M.; Cheryan, Sapna; Meltzoff, Andrew N.","Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

Gender identity and lexical variation in social media,"Bamman, David; Eisenstein, Jacob; Schnoebelen, Tyler","We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population‐level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus‐based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population‐level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same‐gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same‐gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.

Explanations of these differences have long been deficit oriented, focusing on aptitude or similar characteristics, but more recent work focuses on institutional contexts, such as academic climate and feelings of belonging (fit). This study examines the experiences of women and URM students in engineering undergraduate programs, focusing on how they fit, experiential factors affecting fit, and how fit is mitigated by social relationships from their networks and organizations in which they participate (i.e., social capital). Thematic analysis of 55 women and URM interviewee responses shows that students who fit well were those with majority characteristics, including race (i.e., White, White‐passing) and gender (i.e., men, masculine appearance), and those in groups well represented in their programs numerically (i.e., men, Asian). In contrast, women and Black students encountered threats to their fit due to stereotyping from bias and differential treatment from others (i.e., being excluded from group work). However, students received advice from their social networks (i.e., family, professors) in which they were warned to expect discrimination, or through organizations in which they participated (i.e., National Association of Black Engineers) where their sense of community was expanded. The advice and resources provided through this network‐based and participatory social capital mitigated fit for women and Black students, albeit in different ways, helping to preserve their feelings of belonging and promote their persistence in engineering.

Mind the gender gap: The social neuroscience of belonging,"Rippon, Gina","Gender gaps persist in the 21st century, in many aspects of society and in many types of organisation. There are earnings gaps in almost all domains, reports of glass ceilings and the 'missing middle' in business, finance, law and politics, and dramatic under-representation of women in many branches of science, even in the most 'gender equal' countries. This is despite decades of effort to address them, including targeted legislation and many Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. Early essentialist, competence-based explanations for the existence of gender gaps have been largely discredited at the research level, although their persistence in the public consciousness and at the level of education and training can still negatively bias both individual self-belief and organisational processes. Contemporary essentialist explanations are now emerging, with claims that such gaps are the manifestations of the presence or absence of endogenous, brain-based characteristics underpinning career progression or career preferences. The focus remains on the individual as the source of gender imbalances. Less attention has been paid to the contextual aspects of organisations where gender gaps are evident, to inclusion (or the lack of it), or the availability of unbiased reward and progression pathways. Advances in 21st century social cognitive neuroscience are revealing the importance of external organisational processes as powerful brain-changing forces, with their potentially negative impact on self-belief and a sense of belonging. Key research is demonstrating the cortical and behavioural consequences of negative social experiences, with the activation of core inhibitory pathways associated with low self-esteem, lack of engagement, and eventual withdrawal. This paper will argue that reference to such research will provide better explanations for the persistence of gender gaps, and offer evidence-based insights into addressing gender gap issues. Importantly, this is not a rejection of an endogenous, brain-based explanation for gender gaps but the elaboration of a better-informed 21st century model, flagging up the need to take factors such as cultural stereotyping and organisational bias into account in any drive toward true gender equity, or genuinely levelled playing fields.

We used a social-evaluative stress task to investigate coordination among the autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune/inflammatory system in a community sample of 85 healthy African American men and women. Methods: Six saliva samples, 2 at each of baseline, event, and recovery phases of the stressor task, were assayed for cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, salivary alpha-amylase, and salivary C-reactive protein. Individual differences in perceived discrimination and racial identity were also measured. Results: Factor analysis demonstrated that stress systems were largely dissociated before stressor exposure but became aligned during event and recovery phases into functional biological stress responses (factor loadings ≥ .58). Coordinated responses were related to interactions of perceived discrimination and racial identity: when racial identity was strong, highly perceived discrimination was associated with low hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity at baseline (B's = .68–.72, p < .001), low stress mobilization during the task (B's = .46–.62, p < .049), and a robust inflammatory response (salivary C-reactive protein) during recovery (B's = .72–.94, p < .002). Conclusion: Culturally relevant social perceptions may be linked to a specific pattern of changing alignment in biological components of the stress response. Better understanding these links may significantly advance understanding of stress-related illnesses and disparities.

Polarized sharing of fake news on social media: The complex roles of partisan identification and gender,"Turel, Ofir","People can present a systematic bias in sharing fake news on social media based on their political orientation: they tend to share fake news that support their political view more than they share fake news with different political leanings, even though both types of news are equally fake. Here, we explain this systematic bias (termed polarized sharing) by considering social identification theory aspects together with theories on gender differences in social conformity and response to threats. Findings based on a study of 250 Facebook users in the US revealed that partisan identification is a double edge-sword. It increased polarized sharing of fake news directly, but decreased it indirectly, by increasing social network heterophily, which in turn, demotivated polarized sharing of fake news. Importantly, these processes differed by gender. Men were more influenced directly by partisan identification, and women, were more influenced indirectly, through limited social network heterophily. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Preconscious attentional bias to rejection facilitates social distancing for white women in STEM contexts,"Chaney, Kimberly E.","Science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) contexts are imbued with identity-threat cues for women, leading to disengagement. Research on the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis suggests that individuals rapidly detect threat cues and subsequently avoid detected threats to mitigate experiencing the negative implications associated with the threat. Integrating these lines of research, the present research examined White women’s preconscious attentional bias to rejection (PAB-R) and avoidance behavior (social distancing) in STEM contexts after exposure to identity-threat and identity-safety cues compared to neutral conditions. White women’s PAB-R was significantly greater in response to identity-threat cues and significantly decreased in response to identity-safety cues. Moreover, greater PAB-R led to greater social distancing (Studies 1b and 2). The present studies identified PAB-R as a novel, automatic process by which identity cues were associated with avoidance for women in STEM.

While no items showed gender differential item functioning (DIF), two items showed substantial society DIF, and two items showed grade DIF in Japan and South Korea. Concurrent equating created a common measurement scale for the four societies for future comparisons. The multigroup random slope two‐level analysis of the concurrent SOSB measures showed that SOSB is higher among girls than boys. From Grade 4 to Grade 8, SOSBs dropped substantially, especially for South Korea, and gender gaps decreased in Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea.

Given broad investment in data-driven strategies with the rise of Electronic Health Records, scholars and advocates explain the observed missing data as an issue of poor implementation within sites of care. Such an explanation, however, deflects attention away from the upstream conditions that powerfully shape gender and sexual minority health inequities within biomedicine itself, including the content and breadth of clinical training, the location and scope of sites of care, and the diversity of the health professions workforce. Given these existing forms of biomedical stratification, data-driven strategies that prioritize counting patients over redressing structural conditions are unlikely to result in substantive social change. To advance health equity, we must do more than merely collect data: we must shift our analytic to consider the broader context in which health inequalities materialize.

Methods: Data were from the Growing Up Today Study, a national cohort of U.S. young adults. A two-step method (maternal-reported natal sex in 1996 cross-classified with participant-reported current gender identity in 2010) was used to identify gender minority and nongender minority respondents (n = 7,831; mean age = 26 years). Differences in past week depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were examined cross-sectionally by gender identity. Gender minority and nongender minority respondents were compared using age-adjusted logistic regression models. Results: In gender minorities, the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms meeting clinical cutoffs was 52% and 38%, respectively, compared with nongender minorities (27% and 30% in females and 25% and 14% in males; p < .01). Conclusions: Gender identity is an understudied social determinant of mental health. Surveillance efforts to monitor mental health disparities should include survey questions to assess gender identity in epidemiologic research.

Social identity and cycling among women: The case of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa,"Parsha, Avi; Martens, Karel","Through the lens of the Social Identify Theory (Tajfel, 1974), this research aims to understand how social identity affects the perception of cycling as a mode of transport among women from different socio-income backgrounds. Using the case study of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa (Israel), we found that cycling is associated with distinct social categories rather than seen as a 'socially neutral' practice. In particular, we found cycling to be associated with 'being a Tel-Avivian' and with a healthy and active lifestyle. Such distinct identification of cycling is likely to enhance cycling uptake among more privileged groups, who are often able to identify with these social categories. In contrast, it may create a barrier for underprivileged groups, who do not identify with these social categories. In addition, we show how e-bikes—which are not identified with privileged groups—do not provide an identifiable alternative for women from all groups, as it is identified with 'tough' and 'violent' men. Furthermore, we show how cycling, in general, is perceived as 'tough', 'dangerous' and as requiring a 'constant struggle' over space with other road users, and hence fits a typical 'masculine' behavior. Finally, we show how currently cycling is perceived by the underprivileged as a threat to their way of life or even as a symbol of them being pushed out of their neighborhood—a perception that limits cycling uptake among these social groups. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for social identity in cycling research and policymaking, especially in low-cycling contexts.

However, there were also important differences between those who were strong on both empathizing and systemizing, and those who were weak on both. The High–High group shared many of the strengths of those in whom one dimension dominated.

However, variation in TNB young adults’ exposure to social stressors across gender groups, particularly specific nonbinary gender groups (e.g., agender, genderqueer), has not been well characterized. Methods: We analyzed data from an online cross-sectional survey of U.S. TNB young adults (N = 667; ages 18–30 years; 44% White, 24% multiracial, 14% Black, 10% Latinx, 7% Asian, 1% another race/ethnicity), assessing gender non-affirmation; cissexist discrimination, rejection, and victimization; general discrimination; sexual assault victimization; and psychological, physical, and sexual abuse in childhood/adolescence. We used generalized linear models to test for variation in stressors across six gender groups (transgender woman [n = 259], transgender man [n = 141], agender [n = 36], gender fluid [n = 30], genderqueer [n = 51], nonbinary [n = 150]) and compare each group to the full sample. We performed similar analyses among nonbinary gender groups. Results: Exposure to stressors was considerable in all groups. Several stressors (e.g., past-year cissexist discrimination) did not vary significantly by gender group. Compared to the full sample, transgender women reported greater lifetime cissexist rejection and lifetime and past-year cissexist victimization. Compared to the full sample, transgender men and women reported greater lifetime cissexist discrimination and lower past-year gender non-affirmation. No stressors varied significantly across nonbinary gender groups. Conclusion: Among TNB young adults, women, men, and nonbinary people experience distinct patterns of some (though not all) stigma-related stressors. Decisions about (dis)aggregating research participants by gender group, or providing gender-tailored services for TNB people, should account for patterning of pertinent stressors.

Gender Differences in Construction Management Students' Sense of Belonging,"Debs, Luciana; Kota, Bhavya Rathna","Despite significant efforts being made to recruit and retain women, construction is still a male-dominated industry. Though there have been numerous studies on understanding the barriers and retention strategies of females in the industry and academic programs, very few of those analyzed the issue using a sense of belonging framework. The present paper adds to previous studies with the objective to evaluate gender differences in sense of belonging of undergraduate construction management students, as well as common gender stereotypes of women in construction using a survey approach. This research is a pilot inquiry taking place at the authors' institution. Our findings show that female students' sense of belonging is significantly lower than that of male students'. Additionally, our results indicate that both male and female students perceive that there is gender discrimination in the construction industry, though females perceive it at a higher agreement level. Female students also indicate they perceive that recruiters prefer to hire males for jobsite positions, though both female and male students indicated they think women are just as capable in construction and the jobsite. Our findings concur with previous studies on gender differences in construction, yet they provide an interesting benchmark to the sense of belonging of construction students and an updated view of what students' think about women in construction. Results from this pilot study can be used to help academic institutions and industry to create policies to attract and retain more women in construction domains, and provide construction instructors with recent findings to discuss the role of women in construction nowadays. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021,,,,,,,,,#480,Debs 2021,"",""

We will ask participants to share experiences and resources to assist in fostering a culture of belonging both within their classrooms and more broadly within their departments.",2022,,,,,1191,,10.1145/3478432.3499194,,#481,Anderson 2022,"",""
Pathways to Belonging: Understanding How University Entry Routes Shape the Sense of Belonging of Undergraduate Computing Students,"Runa, Shamima Nasrin; McCartan, Andrew; Becker, Brett A.; Mooney, Catherine","Sense of belonging, or belongingness in academia, is an individual's personal conviction as to their acceptance as a valued member of an academic community. The importance of belongingness lies in correlations with motivation, persistence, mental health and well-being. Prior work has shown that belongingness can be lower in students who are minoritised due to their gender, race, nationality, socio-economic status, religion and/or disability. However, there is limited research on how a student's university entry route impacts their sense of belonging in Computer Science and Other Science disciplines. In Ireland's higher education system, university entry is primarily managed through the Central Applications Office (CAO) process, which predominantly serves students transitioning directly from secondary school to university. Additionally, alternative access routes are available for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, those with disabilities, and mature students. At University College Dublin (UCD), entry is facilitated through both the traditional direct-entry school leaving route and combined access routes, each serving distinct student demographics. To investigate how these varying entry routes influence students' sense of belonging, we utilised a survey adapted from the validated 'Math Sense of Belonging Scale' to examine the belongingness of undergraduate Science students, including Computer Science students. We examined how the belongingness of students varies by university entry route, and how the belongingness of students in Computer Science varies by university entry route compared to Other Science students. Our results reveal a significant difference in belongingness between students entering university through the direct-entry school leaving route, compared to those who entered via combined access routes (e.g. university admissions schemes for school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with disabilities, and mature students). Specifically, within Computer Science, students entering university through the direct-entry school leaving route had significantly higher belongingness than combined access route students. These results provide insight that may help others improve the belongingness of undergraduate Computer Science students. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,24,4,,,10.1145/3696464,,#482,Runa 2024,"",""

Evaluating the Sense of Belonging of Undergraduate Computing Students in the UK and Ireland,"Mooney, Catherine; McNeill, Fiona; Becker, Brett A.","Sense of Belonging, or belongingness, is an individual's personal conviction regarding their acceptance as a valued member within an academic community. The significance of student belongingness lies in its correlation with various outcomes including motivation, persistence, mental health and well-being. However, the experience of belongingness is subject to variations influenced by factors such as race/ethnicity and gender. Previous research has demonstrated notable statistical differences in the belongingness experienced by computing students who identify as women or as part of other minoritized groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decline in belongingness among male and female students who do not identify as minoritised, while an increase was observed among women who identify as minoritised. Although students have returned to campus, current surveys reveal that the belongingness levels among men and women who do not identify as minoritised have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in belongingness is observed among men who identify as minoritised. This emphasizes the necessity for continued efforts to restore student belongingness to its pre-pandemic state and shed light on the positive impact that moving to a virtual environment appeared to have on sense of belonging of minoritised women. We have been studying the sense of belonging of undergraduate students in the School of Computer Science at University College Dublin since 2017.

Female Students’ Sense of Belonging Influence on Engineering Technology Degree Retention: A Phenomenological Study,"Wittenmyer, Edith","The retention of female students in engineering technology programs is a concern for midwestern university focusing to foster diversity in engineering and technology fields. This abstract explores the influence of female students' sense of belonging on their retention in engineering technology degree programs. Drawing upon a review of literature and empirical research, this study investigates the factors that contribute to female students' sense of belonging in engineering technology disciplines and its impact on their decision to persist or depart from their academic pursuits. The abstract delves into the multidimensional nature of sense of belonging, encompassing academic, social, and cultural dimensions within the context of engineering and technology education. It examines the role of various factors such as classroom environment, faculty support, peer interactions, mentoring programs, institutional culture, and diversity initiatives in shaping female students' sense of belonging and retention outcomes. Additionally, the abstract accentuates the challenges and barriers that female students encounter in engineering technology programs, including gender stereotypes, implicit biases, isolation, and lack of representation. It emphasizes the importance of creating inclusive and supportive environments that validate female students' experiences, perspectives, and aspirations in engineering and technology fields. The findings suggest that fostering a sense of belonging among female students is crucial for enhancing retention rates and promoting diversity in engineering technology disciplines. The abstract concludes by proposing recommendations for educational institutions, policymakers, and stakeholders to implement strategies and initiatives aimed at improving the sense of belonging among female students and increasing retention in engineering technology degree programs.

A Study on the Differences in Social Identity of College Students,Hengyan Ding; Guifang Fu,"As the backbone of China's development, college students shoulder the future of the nation. It is essential to study their social identity, as it is not only the demand for perfecting China's political education system but also crucial for enriching the social identity theory. In the face of a complex and volatile world with different countries in different development stages, humanity's social identity continuously changes. The social identity of college students is one of the key factors affecting their personal value. In order to investigate the status quo of college students' social identity and whether their gender, grade, the place they came from, financial condition and religious belief influencing it, a questionnaire was designed and filled out by 2034 in-campus students. The result shot that: (1) The social identity of college students is at a relatively high level, and both its gender and grade differences are insignificant, (2) College students coming from urban areas show a higher level of social indentify than those who are from rural areas. (3) The level of social identity is lower among financially disadvantaged ones compared with the rest of the students.

Exploring Female Students’ Sense of Belonging Within Mechanical Engineering: A Mixed-Method Study,"Clavijo, Sandra Furnbach","This mixed-method study explored female students’ sense of belonging while studying in a mechanical engineering program. Mechanical engineering has one of the lowest proportions of women and remains one of the least chosen majors of female engineering students. To start to understand why, it is important to have research focused specifically on female mechanical engineering student experience, distinct from broader STEM studies that often group all engineering and science disciplines. The researcher used STEM identity theory and sense of belonging framework to bring light to the experience of female students studying mechanical engineering. The research employed a sequential explanatory design, utilizing both quantitative surveys and qualitative semi-structured interviews to gather comprehensive data from female mechanical engineering students at a private research university. The study addressed three main research questions: 1) Do female students feel that they belong in the mechanical engineering major? 2) Do female mechanical engineering students feel a different sense of belonging than male mechanical engineering students? 3) What are the most important factors affecting female engineering students belonging while studying mechanical engineering. Findings indicated that while female students generally feel a sense of belonging, they reported lower confidence and perceived less respect from peers and instructors compared to male students. The study highlights the importance of supportive peer networks, inclusive teaching practices, and the flexibility of the mechanical engineering curriculum as pivotal factors influencing female students' sense of belonging. Based on these findings, the dissertation recommended targeted interventions, including the development of training programs, revision of grading practices to foster a growth mindset, and the promotion of female-focused group projects and extracurricular activities. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on gender disparities in STEM fields by providing empirical insights into the unique challenges faced by female mechanical engineering students and offering evidence-based recommendations for fostering gender equity.

Board 280: Family Partnerships in Search for Equity and Excellence in Education: Building a Sense of Belonging with Ownership and Pride Among First-Generation College Students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution,"Salinas, Juan; Salinas, Griselda; Salinas, Elizabeth; Chavez, Yocelin; Santana, Virginia; De Alva, Sherlyn; Vazquez, Sheila Cardenas","In their quest to further their understanding of the power of plática (authentic dialogue) in community engagement efforts, the researchers/practitioners embedded themselves in deep, critical conversations with family leaders from a community-based organization on issues of equity and excellence in education. The Family-Centered transformational theory was developed and shaped by fully engaging in fostering trusting relationships and partnerships with students, their families, and educators over seven years. Family Organizing, Strategic Training, Education and Research is the set of processes and methods that gave form to the Family-Centered Theory of Change. This theory of change was incorporated in the professional development of thirty-two STEM faculty, revised curricula in twenty-two different STEM courses, transformed teaching practices in fifty-two STEM course sections and impacted over 2,000 students and their families. The purpose of this study is to advance the body of knowledge on the operationalization of servingness and to provide insight on the utilization of metrics to assess the impact of equitable, community engagement efforts of servingness at Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Well researched metrics on the sense of belonging and institutional integration were used to assess the effectiveness of the interventions and helped the researchers focus their intended, holistic outcomes on student success to go beyond achievement and persistence. Two-way ANOVA on baseline data (N=779) showed that female undergraduate students have a statistically significant (α=0.05) higher sense of belonging than males throughout their first three years of college. This is consistent with institutional data that show higher retention and graduation rates for female undergraduate students than males, especially in STEM. Research activities have demonstrated that the intervention/enrichment has improved students' motivation, engagement, passing rates, and performance. Theme analysis on (N=151) open-ended surveys collected during an end-of-semester symposium revealed that participants (students, families, and faculty) felt a strong ""sense of belonging with ownership and pride."" This ""unintended"" outcome is of particular interest to the researchers in this study. It not only demonstrates the fulfillment of the intended positive impact of an improved sense of belonging among the participants, but it also suggests equitable outcomes. These results show the effective implementation of the family-centered theory of change in the transformation of teaching practices in STEM courses. In this study, the researchers/practitioners took a critical ethnographic approach to assess the impact of their community engagement efforts in their search of equity and excellence in education. Garcia, Nuñez, and Sansone's (2019) also recommended ethnographic research to understand structures of servingness. The researchers utilized metrics on the sense of belonging and community engagement advanced by Mitchneck (2022) in the operationalization of Garcia, Nuñez, and Sansone's (2019) multidimensional conceptual framework of servingness. Through critical reflection and reflexivity, the researchers used these metrics to assess the impact of the internal processes and methods of the family-centered theory of change and the navigation of institutional, pragmatic mechanisms that led to equitable outcomes among participants. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.",2024,,,,,,,,,#491,Salinas 2024,"",""
Exploring How Computing Courses Contribute to Sense of Belonging,"Fong, M.M.; Watkins, A.; Herman, G.","Sense of belonging correlates with retention rates for university-level students especially for those in their earlier years [5, 9, 10] and for those in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and computing majors [2, 8]. In computing, women and students of color (i.e., Black, Latinx, and Indigenous) tend to report lower sense of belonging compared to men [6, 7]. Unfortunately, we lack consensus on how sense of belonging should be defined, and why students come to feel like they do or do not belong. Past definitions (e.g., [3, 4] help identify educational contexts and students' feelings, they do not necessarily provide coherent insights into why students develop these feelings. Allen et al. [1] developed a conceptual framework that proposes four components that lead to a sense of belonging: competencies, opportunities, motivations, and perceptions. They identified these components through a broad literature review inclusive of educational psychology, clinical psychology, sociology, and other fields. While this work advances our understanding of why someone may develop a sense of belonging, this framework has not been applied to technical or computing contexts. We aim to fill these gaps in the literature by interviewing students who are taking required computer science courses to explore the ways in which their descriptions of their course experiences align with, challenge, or expand upon this framework. To this end, we ask the following research question: RQ: To what extent is Allen et al.'s framework helpful in understanding how students describe their sense of belonging in required computing courses? We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 students from two required, upper-level computing courses. Both courses are typically taken by second year computer science majors, and are also open to other engineering majors. The first two authors qualitatively analyzed interview transcripts using two rounds of coding. Our results provide evidence supporting the conceptual framework. Additionally, examples from our participant showed nuance in how the four components manifest in computing courses. More specifically, participants expressed strong academic motivations to belong in their courses, whereas social motivations to belong existed outside of their courses. To achieve these academic motivations, participants used opportunities inside and outside of courses to find community in computing. However, access to such opportunities varied widely across courses and participants' existing peer relationships. Within these opportunities, our participants placed emphasis on technical competencies (e.g., understanding course material) alongside social competencies (e.g., being inclusive of others). In addition to general feelings of inclusion, our participants describe other perceptions, such as self-efficacy and psychological safety, emerging from motivations to connect with others, opportunities to do so, and competencies to make the most of those opportunities. Importantly, our results point to potential inequities in belonging. For example, students with existing communities within computing may have more opportunities to belong compared to students without; however, course structures and policies (e.g., using randomized groups) may level the playing field. We suggest future research should explore to what degree these components are or are not present, as well as how the presence of these components may vary across demographic groups.",2024,,,vol.2,,531-2,,10.1145/3632621.3671423,,#494,Fong 2024,"",""

Student Sense of Belonging: The Role of Gender Identity and Minoritisation in Computing and Other Sciences,"Runa, Shamima Nasrin; Antoniadi, Anna Markella; Becker, Brett A.; Mooney, Catherine","Sense of belonging, or belongingness, is an important factor in a student's academic life as it is associated with factors such as motivation and persistence, in addition to mental health and well-being. Belongingness has been shown to be correlated with factors such as gender, race, nationality, socio-economic status, religion and disability. Previous work has shown lower belongingness of minoritised women in computing compared to other computing students. However, it is not well known how belongingness in computing compares to other disciplines. This is a difficult comparison to draw as belongingness is closely related to specific contexts including learning environment, and therefore one's discipline. We utilised a survey adapted from the validated ""Math Sense of Belonging Scale"" to examine the belongingness of undergraduate science - including computer science - students. We examined how the belongingness of students varies by gender identity and minoritisation, how the belongingness of computer science students compares to that of other science students, and how the belongingness of students in computer science varies by gender identity and minoritisation compared to other science students. In this specific study we found that belongingness is not statistically significantly different across genders overall. However, minoritised students have statistically significantly lower belongingness, which varies by gender. We also found that the belongingness of computer science students is statistically significantly lower than that of other science students and that belongingness varies across science disciplines by gender and minoritisation. Our results provide insight that may help us as well as others improve the belongingness of undergraduate computer science students, with a particular focus on the intersection of identities. We will explore the impact of interventions to increase belongingness in future work. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2023,,,,,87-96,,10.1145/3576123.3576133,,#496,Runa 2023,"",""

An Equity-minded Assessment of Belonging among Computing Students,"Stewart, Kylan Nicole; Debruhl, Bruce; Wood, Zoe","Creating a Computer Science and Software Engineering Department that supports students with diverse identities and backgrounds is essential to creating a computing workforce that reflects the world at large. Inspired by the work of Metcalf et al.'s survey conducted at the University of Illinois [1], we use the same methods to examine the state of our computing department with respect to issues of inclusive climate and student sense of belonging, which have been shown to be important for retention in STEM fields [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. We use the four areas that contribute to belonging based on the work of Rainey et al. [9] along with a fifth category of learning environment in order to assess our students' sense of belonging. This paper's main focus is based on results from two surveys of California Polytechnic State University students conducted exactly one year apart (2019: n = 154, 2020: n = 122). Both surveys were sent to all computing majors in Spring quarter, the last quarter of the regular academic year. We found that 58-68% of students felt they were not typical computer scientists, which mirrors the results of the survey conducted at the University of Illinois [1], indicating that the lack of belonging is perhaps a ubiquitous problem within the field of computing. Other salient results include identifying the presence of statistically significant differences for some groups based on gender and race & ethnicity. These differences were found when looking at students' senses of their science identity and learning environment. We also found that women had a significantly greater chance of having strong interpersonal relationships within computing. The survey results are augmented by a survey of first-quarter freshmen in Fall 2019 (n = 44) and student interviews conducted in Spring 2021 (n = 15). We hope that the addition of these results explain and expand upon our main results and add insight as to how the student experience can evolve from a student's first quarter onward. These differences shine an important light on some positive trends as well as several concerning differences to be examined in our quest to create a diverse and equitable department. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022,,,,,,,,,#499,Stewart 2022,"",""

Work in Progress: Impact of COVID-19 and the Digital Divide on the Sense of Belonging for Undergraduate Engineering Students,"Gallo, Kasia; Huang-Saad, Aileen; Gomillion, Cheryl; Simpson, Chartrisa Lashan","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced many institutions of higher learning across the United States to pivot to online instruction immediately or close altogether. This transition highlighted many inequities in access to education as well as the sense of community on college campuses for the students. Earlier digital divide research focused mainly on physical access, identifying patterns of hardware access by different social identities such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Soon after, digital divide researchers began to recognize that the divide exists even when there is physical access to hardware, because the usage and the quality of usage varies (Katz & Aspden, 1996). During the COVID-19 pandemic, many students have lost access to the free, public technology resources at their college or university. These inequities in online learning and the potential impact on student success were highlighted by our team in our prior publication (Simpson, 2020). In addition to access to education, students also lose connection with their community available on college campuses. The purpose of our study was to understand the challenges of online learning and the relationship between the Digital Divide and Sense of Belonging in underrepresented students amid a global pandemic. Using qualitative research methods, we examined the questions ""How does the Digital Divide currently impact Sense of Belonging and community in students?"" and ""What patterns will be revealed when we investigate Sense of Belonging across different social identities?"" We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with current and recently graduated undergraduate engineering students. We were intentional to compose a diverse group of interview participants including students from underrepresented groups, including ethnic and gender minorities as well as first-generation students. Of the 20 participants, five self-identified as men and 15 as women; nine self-identified as Black/African American, eight as White, and three as Asian. Four were first-generation students. Four participants were rising juniors, 10 were rising seniors (one 5th year senior), and five were recent alumni (December and May 2020). We conducted first and second-cycle coding data analyses to identify themes regarding the impact of COVID-19 and Digital Divide on Sense of Belonging. Preliminary results suggest the presence of themes highlighting both victories and defeats within the realms of Digital Divide and Sense of Belonging. Digital Divide was highlighted by limitations of students' Physical Home Learning Environment, Internet Connectivity. The negative factors affecting students' Sense of Belonging included Social Isolation; Impersonal Learning; Missing Professional Opportunities, and Individual Differences. The themes highlighting factors that increased students' Sense of Belonging were: Student Organizations Impact; Togetherness in Pandemic; Group Work Benefits; and Connecting Through Tech. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique perspective for researchers to study the commonalities and differences among the experience of engineering students from diverse backgrounds.

Relating students' social belonging and course performance across multiple assessment types in a calculus-based introductory physics 1 course,"Edwards, J.D.; Laguerre, L.; Barthelemy, R.S.; De Grandi, C.; Frey, R.F.","Students' social belonging in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses has repeatedly been shown to be an important influence on students' outcomes in these courses. Previous studies have further identified students' sense of belonging and belonging uncertainty as related but unique components of their broader social belonging that can independently affect outcomes. High belonging uncertainty (doubts about the quality of one's social connections or academic ability in a course) may particularly disadvantage historically marginalized groups in physics, such as women or students of color who face negative stereotypes based on their identity. Additionally, high-stakes exams, such as traditional final exams in introductory physics classes, can disproportionately disadvantage historically marginalized groups. In this study, we investigated the effect of social belonging on students' performance across two Introductory Physics 1 sections with two variations of final assessment: one section that took a traditional final exam and one section that completed a nontraditional final course project. Both assessment types were high stakes and constituted a similar, substantial proportion of students' final course grade. We found that both students' sense of belonging and belonging uncertainty impacted their final assessment score, regardless if they took the traditional final exam or completed the nontraditional final project.

This is particularly true for minoritized students in introductory CS courses. The methods used so far to study sense of belonging in CS have been qualitative or have used a small number of survey items. In this paper, we validate a large 30-item survey originally developed for Mathematics. We collected data from 21 institutions, with 30 faculty and 1165 survey responses. We present a factor analysis for the survey to highlight how it measures factors like 'Membership', 'Acceptance', 'Affect', 'Trust' and 'Desire to Fade'. We measured the students' sense of belonging using the survey and found that it correlates with their learning and their interest to pursue more CS courses. These correlations were nuanced based on students' gender, race, and the type of learning environment. We found that for minoritized students in particular, the interest to pursue CS courses was more correlated with their sense of belonging. A type of learning environment we examined was Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). We studied the differences in sense of belonging between POGIL and non-POGIL classrooms.

Electronic textiles and ambient belonging,"Davis, Richard Lee; Blikstein, Paulo","There is a growing body of evidence showing that electronic textiles provide a promising way of closing gender gaps in computing and electrical engineering. The prevailing explanation for this is framed in terms of attractive forces—women are drawn to e-textiles because of their alignment with ""historically feminine practices"" (Buchholz et al., 2014). However, these gender differences may also be due to repulsive forces. Traditional tools and materials may broadcast ambient identity cues that indicate women do not belong. This hypothesis leads to two predictions: (1) Women and girls are less likely to be interested in workshops that involve tools like wires and soldering irons because they associate those tools with feelings of exclusion and alienation, and (2) e-textiles may be more appealing to women and girls because these tools do not broadcast messages of exclusion. We tested these predictions in an online study with 42 university students (22 male, 20 female). We found that ""standard"" items like soldering irons and wires broadcast ambient identity cues that lowered women’s sense of belonging while having no effect on men. Additionally, we found that e-textiles did not have a similar discriminatory effect. Thus, ""standard"" items are not neutral, but charged with meaning, and these items broadcast messages to women that they do not belong. © ISLS.",2020,,,2,,669-672,,,,#508,Davis 2020,"",""

Using the previously-developed Critical Engineering Agency (CEA) framework to understand how women identify with physics, math, and engineering, we provide insight into the ways in which women can feel they belong in engineering. Fostering this belongingness may begin to create lasting ties between women and their engineering majors and may help to retain more women in the first few years of college, when they are more prone to leave. © 2015 TEMPUS Publications.",2015,,International Journal of Engineering Education,31,4,938-952,,,,#509,Godwin 2015,"",""
"WIP: Investigating the impact of engineering identity, belonging and career commitment on early postsecondary outcomes","Way, Sandra Marie; Arnett, Stephanie M.; Brown, Jeremy J.; Gorham, Miquela K.; Humble, Miss Lorissa","This work in progress paper describes initial findings from a multi-cohort, longitudinal study designed to investigate engineering identity development and the role it plays in postsecondary engineering students' commitment to the field and educational persistence. Although engineering identity is often considered an important contributing factor to educational and occupational persistence, there are few quantitative studies that directly examine this link. This study aims to address this gap and contribute to a better understanding of how we may foster engineering identity and help support students in their educational trajectories. To capture engineering identity, we use survey questions developed and validated in previous research to measure three scientific identity concepts: interest, recognition by self and others, and perceptions of competence and performance in engineering. Drawing on additional concepts in the literature, we also include measures of sense of belonging and commitment to an engineering career. In the spring semester 2019, a baseline survey for our first cohort was administered to 179 early career, engineering students across three public postsecondary Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the Southwest United States. A little more than half of the respondents (N=93) were attending a traditional 4-year university while the remainder (N=86) were attending community college at the time of the survey. Almost 70% of the respondents identified as Latinx, approximately 30% identified as female, and about one-third reported that they were first-generation college students. To examine whether students with higher engineering identity, sense of belonging and career commitment are more likely to persist into their second year and have higher college GPAs, institutional enrollment and achievement data were obtained for all survey participants in our first cohort. Logistic and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression were used to test for significant associations, controlling for demographic factors. Preliminary findings suggest that engineering students' sense of belonging to the field may be especially important. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",2020,,,2020-June,,Abet;-Engineering Unleashed; et al.; Gradescope; IEEE Xplore; Keysight Technologies,,,,#511,Way 2020,"",""
Preliminary findings using growth mindset and belonging interventions in a freshman Engineering class,"Rhee, Jinny; Johnson, Camille; Oyamot, Clifton M.","Engineering is typically plagued with lower graduation rates and larger achievement gaps compared to other majors; the projected demand for its future graduates lends to the urgency in reversing these trends. Holding a growth mindset, or a belief that intelligence is mutable, and a feeling of belongingness are keys to persisting in and graduating from college. In prior research, improvements in retention and graduation rates have been found following minor interventions, particularly among some underrepresented populations of students. The current study explored whether similar interventions could be effective in increasing retention and graduation rates among underrepresented populations of engineering and technology majors. It was conducted in an engineering college in a large, comprehensive, Hispanic-Serving, public university with a sizeable Asian population (40%), and 10-20% gap in the graduation rates of underrepresented and non-underrepresented minorities. The engineering college has a low percentage of women undergraduates (15%) and graduations rates for women are 5-10% higher than those of men. The results of this study may be applicable to other engineering schools with similar characteristics. Following IRB approval, a control assignment or interventions designed to elicit a growth mindset and/or a belongingness mindset were administered in 25 sections of a required Introduction to Engineering course (441 students total), typically taken in the freshman year of all engineering-named and technology programs. Block randomization was used to distribute, as evenly as possible, the gender, ethnic background, and section instructor composition across conditions. Pre- and post-course surveys measured happiness, health, belonging, self-efficacy, and growth mindset, and student grades were collected at the end of the academic term. One year into a 6-year study in which students will be tracked through graduation, preliminary results suggest that the interventions can aid performance. Overall, students who received the belongingness intervention had higher average class grades than those in the control and growth mindset condition, controlling for instructor, HS GPA, and SAT math scores. Further analyses revealed that the interventions had different effects on different demographic groups. First, among women, the growth mindset intervention resulted in lower course performance compared to the control and belongingness groups. Second, among men, the belongingness intervention resulted in higher course performance than in the growth and control. Third, the interventions did not differentially affect course performance among under-represented minorities (URMs). Finally, among non-URMs, the belongingness intervention led to improved course performance compared to the growth mindset and control conditions. Interestingly, prior to the interventions, underrepresented minority students exhibited higher growth mindset scores (effect size = 0.32) than non-underrepresented minority students and women exhibited higher feelings of belonging (effect size = 0.21) than men. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",2017,,,2017-June,,,,,,#514,Rhee 2017,"",""
Investigation of sense of belonging to engineering in undergraduate introductory classes,"Al-Qudah, Sura; Davishahl, Jill; Davishahl, Eric; Greiner, Michael Andrew","This work-in-progress paper investigates students' sense of belonging in introductory classes in engineering and engineering physics. The research project involves students at three educational institutions with similar geographic location but with student bodies of differing demographics and character: a regional university; a community college; and a technical college. Studies have pointed to the effect of the lack of belonging among the classrooms, majors, and the institution in general on students' retention rates and performance in future engineering classes. Sense of belonging has been identified as particularly important to the retention of underrepresented minorities (URM) and women. In a multi-year study published in the 2012 ASEE conference [1] researchers at five institutions conducted an extensive research study of belonging among STEM students in four categories; belonging to the classroom, belonging to the major, belonging to the institution as a resource; and belonging to the institution as a community. Results show a statistically significant difference in belongingness among those students in those four categories at the five institutions based on students' classification. However, results suggested that hypothesizing a monotonic increase in the sense of belonging by year in school cannot be supported by the research findings and educators have to ultimately understand what impacts the sense of belonging and how to improve it over time during college years. At each of the three educational institutions where this current study is performed, the percentage of students who are identified as URMs is about one-fourth of the overall engineering student population. As more initiatives have been emerging in these institutions to help increase diversity and inclusion, the researchers were motivated to conduct this study to improve the belonging of engineering pre-major students in STEM classrooms and their intended majors. This research explores the effect of embedding small interventions designed to improve engineering pre-major students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy into traditionally taught Introduction to Engineering and Introduction to Engineering Physics classes. In addition, this study investigates the effect of the interventions on different student groups (women, first generation, students of color or ethnic background, community college vs. technical college vs. university students, etc.). This study has the potential to benefit first-year engineering education pedagogies by exploring the effectiveness of small interventions that can be embedded into busy course curriculums without significantly detracting from classroom time available for content directly connected to course outcomes. The three interventions used in this study include a first-day collaborative activity to establish classroom norms; a mid-quarter activity centered around growth mindset and metacognition; and a one-to-one instructor/student meeting. The effectiveness of the interventions on increasing sense of belonging is assessed using a series of five Likert scale questions drawn from other belongingness surveys found in the literature [2]. The pre-course survey was administered during the first week of the term with nine questions embedded in a broader ""Getting to Know You"" survey. The post-course survey was administered during the last week of the term with the same nine questions embedded in a broader survey collecting student feedback on the effectiveness of various course learning activities (e.g. homework, projects, lectures, etc). All work was completed with IRB approval and students identity protection. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis is being performed on the collected data. Researchers anticipate that the three interventions will improve student sense of belonging and will look to use the survey response data to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the interventions as perceived by the students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",2018,,,2018-June,,,,,,#515,Al-Qudah 2018,"",""
How undergraduates' involvement affects sense of belonging in courses that use technology,"Long, Leroy L.","In order to increase the number of American degree recipients in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), academics must continually develop ways to improve students' interest, retention, and success in fields like engineering. Prior researchers have studied the use of educational technology as a way to improve student outcomes. Previous scholars have also investigated students' perceptions of the usefulness of technology. However, it is unclear if a statistically significant relationship exists between students' involvement in courses that use technology and their sense of belonging to others on campus. It is also unclear if differences exist in students' perceptions of technology by race/ethnicity or gender. The present study addressed this gap by examining the relationship between technology use, students' class involvement, and their sense of belonging - feelings of connectedness to others. This investigation sought to answer the following research questions: (a) Are there differences in undergraduates' involvement in courses that use technology by college major, race/ethnicity, or gender? (b) Are there differences in undergraduates' feelings of connectedness to others on campus due to technology by college major, race/ethnicity, or gender? (c) What is the relationship between students' involvement in technology-based courses and perceptions of technology's impact on their feelings of connectedness to others on campus? Data was analyzed for close to 500 students using a 2013 national administration of the EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology Survey Questionnaire. Findings from this analysis suggest that (a) students who get more involved in courses that use technology are significantly more likely to believe that technology makes them feel connected to others on campus - indicating a sense of belonging, and (b) students who identify as female, part-time or non-engineering majors are more likely to believe that technology makes them feel more connected to others on campus. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",2016,,,2016-June,,,,,,#516,Long 2016,"",""
Undergraduate Women of Color in Computer Science: How Social and Academic Experiences Shape Sense of Belonging,"Hernandez, Corina","While significant advancements in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) are at the forefront of society, there continues to be a considerable gender and racial gap in the advancement of women of color in these fields (Espinosa, 2011; Ong et al., 2011; Shein, 2018). Low completion rates are even greater when looking at Black and Latina women in computer science (CS). This phenomenological study examined how the academic and social experiences of nine Black and Latina women computer science students shaped their journeys and sense of belonging as developing computer scientists. This study drew upon two interviews and journal entries to unpack how this group of women of color is experiencing their journeys through CS at Rutgers. I used Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Strayhorn’s (2012, 2018) model for sense of belonging for STEM students as frameworks for interpreting the experiences of women of color and what may lead to attrition or unwelcome environments. The findings of this study depict an isolating experience for Black and Latina students in CS. These students faced racist and sexist comments from their peers, which deeply impacted their ability to feel connected. They were conscious of their status as the ""only one,"" which hindered their ability to develop a sense of belonging. To counteract these feelings, many of the participants found solace in women-centric programming, including a Computer Science Living-Learning Community. Some critical recommendations include funding women-centric intervention programs, implementing inclusive hiring practices to hire more women in CS leadership positions, and building a working group of faculty and staff to examine the issues in the local context. The paper begins with the statement of the problem and social context. Next, I review relevant literature that examines the lack of women of color in STEM and CS. Following the literature review, I describe the methods and findings. Finally, I conclude with implications and limitations.

Board 214: An Investigation of Women Engineering Undergraduate Student Belonging in an Academic Makerspace,"Bravo, Elisa; Daly, Shanna R.; Austin-Breneman, Jesse","Academic makerspaces are physical locations that help support engineering classroom instruction and provide exposure to workplace skills like prototyping and design. Makerspace proponents have championed equitable makerspaces as sites for increased access to tools and knowledge in science and engineering [1]. However, this promise is yet to be realized, with an emerging body of work critiquing the notion they are delivering equitable benefits to all students [2]-[4]. This literature finds that access is not sufficient for true democratization, which cannot be reached without the full participation of a diverse student population. Hagerty et al. [5], define full participation as characterized by individuals' sense of belonging in these spaces. To further the discussion on equitable makerspaces, this study focuses on understanding the sense of belonging of women engineering students in academic makerspaces. Although prior work has explored makerspace users' sense of belonging, these studies are typically quantitative, not answering how students understand their belonging [6], [7]. Qualitative work on topics similar to sense of belonging, like the culture of belonging within makerspaces, is often centered on the staff or administrator perspective [8]. There is limited work addressing the factors impacting students' sense of belonging from their point of view. To fill this gap, we interviewed four women engineering students that were involved in different makerspaces at a large public, research-intensive university in the Midwest. Specifically, our work seeks to understand the impact of previous making experiences on students' belonging. The work of Hagerty et al. [5] was used as a theoretical framework to inform the interview protocol and data analysis. Results from this analysis show that the factors signaling belonging changed as women increased their level of making experience, either prior to entering the space or during their time in the makerspace. Students with little prior experience saw their belonging as a function of the amount of time they spent in the space, while more experienced participants tied their belonging to social aspects or to the purpose of the space. The findings from this study provide an interesting point of reflection for makerspace staff to consider when creating a makerspace that encourages belonging. To promote a culture of belonging in academic makerspaces, this study suggests administrators and staff members should consider the variation in understanding how one belongs to a space. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",2023,,,,,,,,,#518,Bravo 2023,"",""

Significant variations in women's participation in engineering among countries imply a cultural effect. This study demonstrates an inverse relationship between a culture's Hofstede's Cultural Dimension of Masculinity and women's participation in engineering. Hofstede's Cultural Dimension of Masculinity was applied to US subcultures to better understand the role of US subcultures on women's representation in engineering degree programs. This study also compared perceptions held by engineering and health and human services students regarding relative suitability of people of their gender for careers in their fields, relative difficulty associated with working in their profession for people of their gender, and gender biases in their discipline as well as student's sense of belonging in their discipline. The analysis used survey data collected from 613 students in the college of engineering and the college of health and human services at California State University, Fresno, a Hispanic Serving Institution. Differences in perceptions of gender-based suitability and levels of belongingness were observed between ethnic groups.

Identity work by a young petite female academic home comer: quest for social power in masculine settings,"Liyanagamage, N.; Fernando, M.","Purpose How do females with multiple sources of identity deal with intersectional identity tensions and perceived lack of access to social power? The study focuses on how social relationships form and develop in masculinised settings between construction workers and a petite female researcher through perceived notions of equality and inequality. Through autoethnographic tales, the study examines how an academic home comer navigates between conflicting professional and cultural identities, in their native country. Design/methodology/approach Using collaborative autoethnography, the study examines how the intersections of being a young petite female and a ""partial"" insider in a male-dominated construction industry influences the researcher's identity work process and her quest for social power. Findings The findings suggest that to access referent social power, the researcher covers stigmatised intersectional attributes and reveals a more favourable identity. The fieldwork journey of the young petite female researcher highlights that identity work is a situational process that evolves with respondent relationships, respondent assigned roles, perceived notion of access to power and struggles of cultural versus professional identity. The reader is also taken through the collaborative autoethnographic journey of a female researcher and her doctoral studies supervisor. Originality/value This paper makes several contributions. First, it contributes to the academic literature on intersectionality of identity, especially concentrating on the intersectional attributes of petite physical stature, gender and perceived lack of access to social power. Second, this paper theorises identity work processes as an indirect strategy of social power in researcher-and-researched relationships. Last, through collaborative autoethnography of female researchers' fieldwork journey, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on academic home comers as ""partial"" insiders in their native country.",2022,,Qualitative Research in Organizations and Management: An International Journal,,,281-98,,10.1108/QROM-05-2021-2152,,#521,Liyanagamage 2022,"",""
Belongingness of Chilean Engineering Students: A Gender Perspective Approach,"Becerra-Cid, Macarena; Quezada-Espinoza, Monica; Truyol, Maria Elena","Students' affective characteristics, such as motivation, attitudes, self-efficacy, expectations, and sense of belonging, are relevant topics for higher education research. Much research indicates that having a sense of belonging in academic, social, and community settings are critical to students' development, engagement, and persistence. Prior research on women's participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers discusses the need to improve their sense of belonging as a socio-cognitive variable related to the gender imbalance in participation in STEM areas. Women's sense of belonging is crucial to higher education institutions, especially in highly masculinized careers such as engineering. It increases academic motivation and can influence their success in higher education. However, statistics worldwide show that the increase in the sense of belonging and, thus, in the participation of women in STEM areas has not risen enough to reduce the gender gap. In the current research work, we present data collected over one semester in an Engineering School at a large private university in Chile. Our main objective is to diagnose and analyze the students' sense of belonging in social and academic areas, their self-efficacy, and perceived institutional support from a gender perspective. With a quantitative approach, survey data was collected to assess students' sense of belonging as engineering students. The validated survey consists of 33 items distributed in four constructs: 1) Sense of belonging-general, 2) sense of belonging-interactions, 3) Self-efficacy and 4) Perceived institutional support. From this, we identify and discuss the student's sense of belonging and how it interacts with self-efficacy and perceived institutional support. This research allows us to have evidence that supports the visibility and creation of initiatives on the services offered to students, which impact their sense of belonging. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",2023,,,,,,,,,#522,Becerra-Cid 2023,"",""
Sense of Belonging of Women in Construction: Insights from Focus Groups,"Quezada-Espinoza, Monica; Silva, Marcela; Alvarado, Carolina","The sense of belonging of women in male-dominated spheres is a factor that hinders the closing of gender gaps. An extensive body of research that analyzes the sense of belonging of women who work in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concludes that the improvement of this factor increases the self-confidence, academic performance, and retention rates of women therein. The field of construction engineering is one of the most male-dominated professions and it is, therefore, important to understand the way in which women who pursue a career in this particular field conceive of their sense of belonging. Furthermore, an evaluation of the experiences of such women and how these have impacted and influenced their career and contributed to their sense of belonging to the field of construction would enhance the aforementioned understanding. Accordingly, this research analyzes the perspectives of women related to a construction engineering program, as students, alumni working in the field, and faculty in a construction program, regarding their sense of belonging. We categorize their experiences and their proposed solutions to improve that sense of belonging of women in the field of construction. Through a qualitative approach, the main findings are reported on three focus groups held with ten women, all students, former students, and teaching professionals from a Construction Engineering degree program at a private Chilean university. This methodology presents results regarding participant perception of their sense of belonging, their positive and negative experiences in an environment related to construction, whether in the campus or work context, and their proposed solutions for enhancing this sense of belonging within the sector. Despite differences in participants' life stages, they all believe that self-confidence, recognition from peers and leaders, social interactions, and knowledge and skills are critical factors that improve their sense of belonging. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",2023,,,,,,,,,#523,Quezada-Espinoza 2023,"",""

The ecological belonging intervention we are scaling through a collaborative effort at the University of Pittsburgh, Purdue University, and the University of California, Irvine has been shown to erase long-standing equity gaps in student outcomes in introductory STEM courses and requires only one class or discussion/recitation session to implement. Instructors play a key role in the student experience, and their perspectives on diversity, equity, and inclusion may contribute to their willingness to implement this intervention within their courses. This work investigates both student-level and instructor-level issues, specifically: 1) the ways in which a brief ecological belonging intervention should be customized for different course contexts; 2) the key mechanisms underpinning how the intervention supports proximal and distal student outcomes; and 3) the efficacy and mechanisms by which course onboarding strategies involving leadership messaging and community learning processes are successful across varied course, departmental, and university contexts in transforming each targeted course. In this paper, we focus on the third component and describe our process for building buy-in with leadership and faculty regarding this intervention. As a part of this process, we have gathered survey information to understand instructor willingness to use this intervention in their classroom including instructor attitudes about diversity, equity, and inclusion; barriers for implementation; and other concerns. One of the goals is to identify differences between faculty who would be willing to take action to address these equity issues through implementing the ecological belonging intervention and those who would not be willing to do so.

"Examination of Perceived Climate, Engineering Identity, and Belongingness among Undergraduate Women in Engineering","Raisa, Sumaia Ali; Rambo-Hernandez, Karen E.; Curtis, Reagan","More women than men in the US graduate college, but women constitute only 16% of the engineering workforce [1]. Women frequently attribute their lack of persistence in engineering to a chilly academic climate [2]. Researchers have suggested that developing a robust engineering identity could moderate a climate effect and support improved retention and graduation of female engineers [2]. However, there is little empirical data on interrelationships among gender, perceived academic climate in engineering programs, engineering identity, and belonging to an engineering community. We drew on social identity theory and extant literature to develop four research questions: 1) Are there any differences between men and women regarding perceived academic climate, sense of belonging, and engineering identity? 2) Does academic climate predict engineering identity in the same way for women and men? 3)Does sense of belonging mediate the relationship between perceived academic climate and engineering identity? 4) Do engineering students who are women demonstrate different relationships among perceived climate, engineering identity, and belongingness from men? We used survey data from a multi-year NSF-funded project (Award # 1726268, #1726088, and #1725880/2033129) that incorporated experimental course-based interventions to build an inclusive curriculum. Surveys were administered at the beginning and end of the semester. We found that at the end of the semester women engineering undergraduates reported lower engineering identity though the initial engineering identity, perceived academic climate, and sense of belonging were the same for both men and women engineering undergraduates. Multiple regression analyses with 601 first-year engineer majors (21% female) indicated perceived climate and gender accounted for 48% of engineering identity variability. The interaction between perceived climate and gender on engineering identity was not statistically significant. Mediation analysis revealed that sense of belonging (b=0.42, 95% CI [0.30, 0.53]) mediated the relationship between perceived climate and engineering identity for both males and females. Sense of belonging was critical in engineering identity. Moderated mediation analysis indicated gender did not moderate the indirect effect of perceived climate on engineering identity through a sense of belonging. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021,,,,,,,,,#525,Raisa 2021,"",""
"Role of Mentorship, Career Conceptualization, and Leadership in Developing Women's Physics Identity and Belonging [arXiv]","Rosenberg, J.L.; Holincheck, N.; Fernandez, K.; Dreyfus, B.W.; Wardere, F.; Stehle, S.; Butler, T.N.","The percentage of women receiving bachelors degrees in physics in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people.

Sounds like a fit!

We built on lack of fit and signaling theory to argue that women's but not men's pursuit of career opportunities would be influenced by recruiter gender and gender-stereotypical wording in recruitment advertisements. We conducted two studies in Germany. In Study 1 (video-based experiment with 329 university students), we found that when a male recruiter used stereotypically masculine compared to feminine wording, female students anticipated lower belongingness, expected lower success of an application, and indicated lower application intentions for career opportunities. These differences in female students' evaluations disappeared when the recruiter was female. While Study 2 (experimental vignette study with 545 employees) replicates the negative effects of masculine wording for female employees; the buffering effect of female recruiters was only replicated for younger, but not for older female employees. Women's anticipated belongingness mediated the relationship between advertisement wording and application intentions when the recruiter was male. Recruiter gender and wording had no effects on men.

Female Students’ Social Identity Experiences in Civil Engineering Classrooms,"Mtshali, Thokozani Isaac","When students have to face the real world and put into practice all the knowledge and skills they have learned during their years of education, their learning experiences are crucial. What happens when a group of students perceive that their education favors one gender over another? The study examines the social identity experiences of female students in an engineering course at a TVET college in South Africa. In order to achieve this purpose, the study adopted a qualitative research approach, using 11 female students that were conveniently sampled. Focus group and individual interviews were used to gather data. Because this study was based on understanding the female students’ social identity, Social Identity Theory was deemed relevant to frame the study. The findings reveal that the female students felt neglected during classroom discourses as lecturers presented slides, showed examples, and made assessments using a gender specific figure. It was further discovered that it is rare in the engineering classroom to find problem-solving scenarios where a female leads, works, and coordinates engineering projects; male figures are unconsciously presented, leading to social exclusion. It is therefore recommended that engineering lecturers design activities that show female representation in the engineering classroom.

A qualitative exploration of young female Muslims’ perspectives of abortion and belonging following the 2018 Irish Abortion Referendum,"Agha, Yumna; Gaynor, Keith","IntroductionIn 2018, Ireland conducted a referendum, ultimately supporting the legalisation of abortion. The views of religious minority groups can go unheard ‘by an insensitive majority’ in national cultural debates. This study explores female Muslim Irish university students’ perspectives on abortion and the impact of the 2018 Irish abortion debate on their sense of belonging within Ireland.MethodsTen female Muslim university students completed semi-structured interviews. The interview comprised seven open-ended questions examining perspectives on abortion and a sense of national belonging. A thematic analysis was carried out on the data.ResultsSix major themes emerged: (1) specific circumstances, (2) Islam, (3) family, (4) misuse of new laws, (5) stable sense of national belonging, (6) consequences of historical abortion legislation. Participants were largely supportive of the legal changes. Participants indicated that their sense of national belonging might have been affected if their religious beliefs had conflicted with the referendum outcome.ConclusionsParticipants largely supported the legalisation of abortion in Ireland, provided that the new laws aligned with their Islamic beliefs. The research indicated the referendum did not affect young Muslim women’s sense of belonging in Ireland.Policy ImplicationsMany national debates on social issues focus on winning majority support.

Nowhere to bi: Barriers to belonging in the broader LGBTQ+ community for Aboriginal bi+ people in Australia,"Henningham, Mandy","Having a multiplicity of identities not only makes it difficult to find inclusive spaces for Aboriginal bisexual+ (bi) people but may often be a barrier to building connections and relationships with people who have other queer identities. Bi + identities alone are often rendered invisible, unintelligible or erased when it comes to inclusion and solidarity among their peers. An intersectional lens is used to reflexively investigate existing literature to explore how a lack of solidarity among lateral communities may impact Aboriginal bi + people in Australia who face an array of racism and queerphobia from both LGBTQ + and Aboriginal communities. These unique and multifaceted layers of discrimination greatly impact mental health and wellbeing. These experiences stem from the heterosexist and monosexist status quo from heteropatriarchal settler colonialism that is seen in both Aboriginal and LGBTQ + communities respectively. As a result, Aboriginal queer people are constantly surveying risks, policing their own identities and identity expression, often hiding parts of their identity as a survival strategy to avoid rejection and adhere to dominant cultural norms. When specifically considering Aboriginal bi + identities, there are added unique stressors of lateral violence with other LGBTQ + groups, antibisexual prejudice, and assumed monosexuality, adding additional layers of minority stress. The author explores these experiences by extending upon borderland theory and minority stress models. Whilst there is solace in the holistic celebration of intersecting identities in emerging intersectional Aboriginal queer spaces, there is still a great need for solidarity and celebration of Aboriginal bi + people within the broader LGBTQ + community.",2024,,Journal of Lesbian Studies,28,1,63-83,2915814072,https://doi.org/10.1080/10894160.2023.2233339,,#544,Henningham 2024,"",""
Examining the Role of Childhood Experiences in Gender Identity and Expression: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis Using Social Learning Theory,"Dodgers, Steph; Cordoba, Sebastian; Coe, Jennifer","This qualitative study examines the role of childhood experiences and memories in shaping individuals’ gender identities, expressions, and life trajectories. Whilst some research has examined the role of gender stereotypes in people's life trajectories, no research has focused on people's retrospective accounts of their gender socialisation about their current understanding of (their own) gender. We conducted eight semi-structured interviews with 20–30-year-olds living in the UK to do this. We employed interpretative phenomenological analysis to analyse our data, which enabled us to investigate participants’ memories of their gender socialisations, observations, and internalisations in childhood and their interpretation of these experiences. Using insights from social learning theory, this study provides further insights into the processes of observations, internalisations, and subsequent challenges to gender based on their retrospective accounts. We show the impact of hegemonic gender stereotypes in the participants' life trajectories and hobbies (mainly sports), showing the limitations created by the gender binary system. Notably, the present findings support social learning theory, as it shows how the internalisation of gender can be challenged by new forms of gender resocialisation, including the promotion of gender equity in sports, the possibilities of gender expressions and identities beyond the binary, and the free articulation and expression of these concerns in society. By showing how gender internalisations can be malleable, this research provides practical recommendations for tackling unnecessary gender divisions in childhood settings.",2023,,Gender Issues,40,2-4,255-274,2895543480,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12147-023-09314-4,,#545,Dodgers 2023,"",""
Social Representations of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Among Nurses in Portugal,"Gomes, Alexandre; Saleiro, Sandra Palma; Pegado, Elsa; Barroso, Margarida Martins","IntroductionA number of studies in different countries have highlighted discrimination of sexual and gender minorities in healthcare environments. Although Portugal has made considerable progress in the acquisition of rights for LGBT people, there are still gaps in the training of health professionals. Among these, nurses are at the forefront of many of the close interactions with patients. This article aims to ascertain the social representations of sexual orientation and gender identity among nurses in Portugal from a sociological perspective.MethodsA quantitative survey of Portuguese nurses was conducted in an online questionnaire. The data were collected between May and July 2020, and the participants were recruited through the Portuguese Nurses Association. The universe of the study consisted of 75,928 nurses, from which a sample of 899 was obtained.ResultsThe results showed that Portuguese nurses tended to have a positive social attitude towards non-normative sexual orientations and gender identities, which they perceived as a natural expression of human diversity. This attitude was stronger among the younger, politically left-leaning participants without a religion, and close to LGBT people. The vast majority recognized that they lacked adequate training in LGBT issues and a significant part expressed the need to bridge that gap, mainly with regard to gender identity.Conclusions and Policy ImplicationsThis study provides insights into the insufficient inclusion of LGBT matters in nursing courses, and the need for ongoing, and specialized training. Knowledge and cultural competencies in the care of LGBT people should be guaranteed and made universal for nursing and other health professionals in order to reverse the reduction in their access to healthcare and ensure respect for the human right to health for LGBT people.",2023,,Sexuality Research & Social Policy,20,4,1498-1514,2888701314,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-023-00816-0,,#546,Gomes 2023,"",""

"Reluctant Belonging: Tudung (Headscarf), Communalism, and Muslim Politics in Urban Malaysia","Basarudin, Azza","The politics of modesty—clothing, behavior, interactions, and headscarf—remain contested within and outside Muslim communities. Headscarf practices are multivalent, with ties to national and local contexts and shaped by the transnational circulation of Islam. A nuanced approach to these variously situated practices—across narratives of choice, religiosity, nationalism, and consumerism—requires a reappraisal of patriarchal nationalism beyond the circumscribed Euro/American post-9/11 experience of Islamophobia. I analyze Malay Muslim women's tudung (headscarf) dilemmas in this article, arguing for a capacious feminist epistemology that critiques localized patriarchy within anti-imperialist and transnational perspectives. Based on intimate patchwork ethnography in urban Malaysia, I offer a feminist reading of gendered piety, communal belonging, and Islamization debates. I draw on intergenerational narrations of subjectivity to reveal how the state and community regulate tudung practices through the cultural construction of Muslim difference. I conclude by suggesting that feminist analyses attentive to the deep imbrication of patriarchal nationalism, anti-imperialist, and transnational configurations can support the reimagining of ethical possibilities in the study of gender in Muslim cultures.",2023,,Feminist Formations,35,2,198-225,2884501747,https://doi.org/10.1353/ff.2023.a907927,,#548,Basarudin 2023,"",""
Gender Identification Beyond the Binary and Its Consequences for Social Well-Being,"Wickham, Miriam Ines; van Nunspeet, Félice; Ellemers, Naomi","Recent societal initiatives (e.g., gender-neutral toilets, clothing, and language) highlight the ongoing shift of gender away from binary categories: “man” and “woman.” We identified and investigated two reasons for this shift: that many people may not identify with strictly binary categories and that this may have negative social consequences. Employing a multiple-identification model, we measured intergroup self-categorization with both men and women (Studies 1 and 2), as well as with a “third gender” (Study 3) and investigated how multiple identifications are related to social well-being (Studies 2 and 3). In Study 1 (N = 182, mean age = 32.74, 121 women), we found that a binary model was not the best fit for our gender identification data. In Study 2 (N = 482, mean age = 30.98, 240 AFABs), we found four clusters of gender identification, replicating previous research. Furthermore, we found that gender non-conforming participants reported being less able to be their authentic selves than binary participants. We also found that participants who identified lowly with both binary genders reported lower well-being in general (belongingness, self-esteem, life satisfaction, positive affect). In Study 3 (N = 280, mean age = 36.97, 140 AFABs), we found that asking about a third gender seemed to change how much participants reported identifying with men and women. We also found that gender non-conforming participants reported lower authenticity, belongingness, and self-esteem.

Social and Cultural Correlates of Identity Management Strategies Among Lesbian and Gay People: The Role of Intergroup Structure and Self-Construal,"Aybar Camposano, Gustavo A.; Rodrigues, David L.; Moleiro, Carla","IntroductionLesbian and gay (LG) people often respond to stigmatization by managing their sexual identity. LG people may disassociate from their LGBTQ + ingroup (i.e., individual strategies) or connect to it (i.e., collective strategies). Yet, many factors that may prompt LG people to use either strategy have been generally overlooked. We explored whether socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age and gender), perceptions of the relationship between the LGBTQ + ingroup and heterosexual outgroup, and self-construal were associated with identity management strategies among LG people.MethodsA sample of 204 LG people (Mage = 29.78) was collected online via Prolific Academic between 2020 and 2021.ResultsHierarchical linear regressions showed that LG people who perceived the status of their LGTBQ + ingroup relative to the heterosexual outgroup as legitimate in (im)permeable and (un)stable, contexts reported engaging in more individual strategies. Those endorsing an independent self-construal were less likely to engage in individual strategies and conveyed more LGBTQ + social support. In contrast, those with higher interdependent self-construal were more likely to engage in collective strategies. Gay men were more likely to dissociate from the LGTBQ + ingroup, whereas lesbian women were more likely to seek its support. Older LG people reported lower engagement in collective strategies.ConclusionThese findings help paint a picture of how social and cultural variables factor in LG people managing their sexual identity as a possible response to stigma.Policy ImplicationsThe results can help inform policies and interventions addressing sexual identity stigma and health inequalities by emphasizing the nuances of individual-level factors among LG people.",2022,,Sexuality Research & Social Policy,19,4,1763-1777,2740366517,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-022-00754-3,,#550,AybarCamposano 2022,"",""
“Being Trans Intersects with My Cultural Identity”: Social Determinants of Mental Health Among Asian Transgender People,Ashe Yee,"Purpose: While studies on the relationship between social determinants and mental health among transgender people in Asia are increasing, there is a paucity of research on Asian transgender people living in Western countries.

There were high levels of unmet needs for gender-affirming care, and participants reported a range of negative experiences at health care settings. About two-fifths had been discriminated because of their transgender (42%) or Asian (39%) identities. Fewer than half of participants felt that their family members were supportive of them being transgender (44%), and most reported they had supportive friends (73%). More than two-thirds of participants (68%) had a strong sense of belongingness to the transgender community and 35% reported this for the Asian community. Qualitative findings revealed specific challenges that participants experienced; these included barriers to accessing health care due to their migrant status and language barriers, influences of Asian cultures on mental health experiences, and rejection by family and people in Asian communities.Conclusion: Our study provides evidence for health care providers, researchers, and policy makers to employ a culturally appropriate lens to improve knowledge about the intersectional experiences of being Asian and transgender.",2022,,Transgender Health,7,4,329-339,2697161880,https://doi.org/10.1089/trgh.2021.0007,,#551,AsheYee 2022,"",""
WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN AFRICA: BELONGING AND ISOLATION,"Babtunde, Durojaye Oyedolapo","A growing phenomenon in Africa today has seen to an increasing gender relations and growing political participation compared to what obtained in early post-independence Africa. However with these changes, a notable rooted existence of gender discrimination still persists, and made apparent by the continental political evolution, culture and perception. Thus, a growing feministic concern is bothered on the unfair perception of gender inferiority accrued to women in Africa political settings, and their consequent ostracizing alienation from public and political occupancies and offices. The genesis of this in Africa stemmed directly from the dictates of African traditional culture of feministic sub-serviency to men, male autocratic and authoritative inclination, and the general African perception that women are meant for the homes, occupying their traditional housewifeship and motherhood positions. Therefore, a critical review of the phenomenon was carried for the study. Today, African traditions and persistent male authoritativeness, coupled with women 's resignation to fate and traditions and a self-imposed inferiority, have spurned political gender discrimination in Africa to heights of social injustices and deprivation of rights, and thus hinder women 's initiative for equality of rights, participation and citizenship, and an eventual achievement of various feministic aspirations and dreams. Thus, engendering a politically impaired gender relation in Africa. In submission, for Africa to structurally adapt to a gender expressive and participatory nation-states, re-engineer its gender discriminative structures, and institute a practicable gender tolerance and justice, equality of rights and citizenship, Africans most especially men must do away with its traditional perception of women, most part of the male dominance, and encourage women to their need for political participation and contribution to nation building for the good of one and all.",2021,,Gender & Behaviour,19,3,18366-18374,2629425937,,,#552,Babtunde 2021,"",""
Born this Way–or Not?

We investigated one of the factors that may reduce bisexual individuals’ feelings of belonging in and identification with the LGBTQ+ community: Sexual orientation essentialism. Across two online studies with participants recruited through Prolific, we tested whether bisexual people endorsed sexual orientation essentialism less than lesbian and gay individuals and, in turn, feel lower levels of identification and belonging with the LGBTQ+ community. Essentialism separated into three dimensions in Study 1 (N = 375): Entitativity, naturalness, and discreteness. Relative to lesbian and gay individuals, bisexual individuals viewed sexual orientation as less natural, in turn reporting lower levels of belonging and identification. They also viewed sexual orientation groups as less discrete, which instead translated to higher levels of belonging and identification. Sexual orientation groups did not differ in their endorsement of entitativity beliefs. In Study 2 (N = 390), we focused on naturalness and replicated findings from Study 1. In addition, lower naturalness beliefs were associated with the belief that one’s own views were different from those held by the LGBTQ+ community, which also contributed to lower levels of belonging and identification.

We explored whether various sources of social belongingness moderated the path between entrapment and suicidal ideation and whether those sources of social belongingness moderated the indirect effect of homophobic violence on suicidal ideation through entrapment. Results showed that homophobic violence and entrapment were positively associated with suicidal ideation and that family belongingness was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Homophobic violence and suicidal ideation were not indirectly linked through entrapment. The interaction effect between entrapment and family belongingness was significant, suggesting that, on average, the effect of entrapment on suicidal ideation decreased when family belongingness was high.

Multi-ethnic Girls' Social Positional Identities in Educational Transitions,"Roth, Solveig; Stuedahl, Dagny","In this article, we examine the case history of a young multi-ethnic Norwegian girl, whom we call Anna, from the age of 15 to 17 to show how her self-understanding of positionings within her educational transitions illustrates how gendered expectations in a Norwegian context influence girls’ future trajectories. We use the concepts of social positional identities in figured worlds and performativity to explore self-understanding. Anna’s case history illustrates how gender performativity comes about out of a complex web of family, school, and societal expectations. We discuss the tensions Anna experienced in her educational trajectory and the changes in her performative positioning when she entered upper secondary school.

Cartographers of Disrupted Belonging: Sudanese Mothers Drawing Maps of Portsmouth (UK),"Sanders, Charlotte","Map-making is an everyday practice for Sudanese women in Portsmouth. Arriving to the city within the last twenty-five years, women continue to work hard to reconfigure their sense of place, to reorient themselves in urban space, and to relearn the landmarks of everyday life so as to produce comfortable homes and lives for their families. Through the methodology of 'mental mapping', in which women sketch the city from memory, their practices of everyday cartography are revealed. This invests women's mundane movements in unfamiliar - and frequently hostile - urban spaces with agential power. At the same time, these visual articulations of urban space make clear the limitations of women's mobilities and spatial knowledges in the city. The city's landmarks describe everyday circuits of mothering, timetables of domestic and child-rearing duties which both produce and repress particular urban mobilities. Furthermore, their maps also trace classed and racialised formations of space in Portsmouth, underscoring the centrality of both mothering and 'Othering' to the construction of Sudanese women's urban spatialities and spatial knowledges. Interweaving these visual articulations of space with women's oral insights, I show how spatial domination produces particular im/possibilities for subjecthood, belonging and the liveability of life in urban contexts as gender, race and class intersect. More specifically, these routes and rhythms of everyday life disrupt Sudanese women's capacity for relational belongings, the pursuit of study and employment, and the securing of citizenship. Taking the spatial and the temporal contours of the everyday seriously illuminates the infra/structural configurations of domination which shape different sorts of lives in the city through particular nodes of im/mobility and in/visibility. This paper contributes to discussions in critical migration studies and feminist geography by making M/othering - that is mothering and 'Othering' - central to conceptualising everyday experiences of disrupted belonging.",2019,,Journal of International Women's Studies,20,4,5-23,2236131262,,,#569,Sanders 2019,"",""
Sponsorship and social identity in advancement of women leaders in South Africa,"Scheepers, Caren Brenda; Douman, Anastasia; Moodley, Preya","PurposeIn South Africa, women in senior management positions experience social identity dilemmas, necessitating more research into this domain. While research has been conducted into coaching and mentoring of these women, limited scholarly attention has been paid to sponsorship. This paper aims to explore the social identity of women at senior management levels and sponsorship as a proposed mechanism to develop talented women.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative research included two studies using two sample groups, both of which included executive-level respondents in corporate organisations. One study focussed on sponsorship; here, the 29-strong sample included 14 male and 15 female executives, of whom 15 were White; 9 were African and 5 were Indian. The second study, consisting of only African, coloured and Indian (ACI) female executives (23 interviewees), focussed more broadly on their development path to the C-suite.FindingsA common theme across the two studies was the inclination to give developmental support, in turn, once supported. There were prerequisites in this support-giving, however. For example, sponsors identified criteria that protégés had to meet. Despite evident gender inequality at senior management levels in South Africa, this paper reveals that in the Study 1 sample, gender and race were ostensibly irrelevant when choosing a sponsor or who to sponsor. A closer examination revealed a gender-based expectation, embedded in the South African context. Study 2 showed that ACI women above 50 years of age were more inclined to mentor others; even when they themselves were not mentored, some purposefully developed other ACI women. This paper thus suggests age as an important additional diversity dimension in relation to the career development of ACI women towards the C-suite. The findings have implications for the career development of individual ACI women and for organisations in reaching equality.Research limitations/implicationsGender differences with regard to perceptions also revealed that male respondents perceived sponsorship more as task-based actions, whereas female respondents focussed on relational elements. The paper concludes with recommendations on how individual ACI women and organisations can proactively develop talented women.Originality/valueThe paper offers insight into the gendered expectations of sponsors and gendered perceptions around merit in identifying protégés worthy of sponsorship.

Engendering Identity: Toward a Clearer Conceptualization of Gender as a Social Identity,"Schmader, Toni; Block, Katharina","Wood and Eagly ( 2015 ) make a valuable contribution to the understanding of gender psychology by reviewing how gender identity has been conceptualized in different literatures. But beyond comparing and contrasting these two traditions in North American and Western European samples, we advocate for more clarity in how gender identity is defined and theorized to relate to personality traits. In this commentary, we favor reserving the term gender identity for one's gender-relevant self-categorization and outline three main reasons why traits such as agency and communion should not be conflated with gender identity: (a) They are universal dimensions of human behavior that (b) can be decoupled from gender, and (c) when linked to gender exacerbate gender differences in these traits. Broader theoretical models, such as balanced identity theory, can improve understanding of when and why gender identity becomes associated with certain traits to inform self-definition. Although the process by which gender identity becomes linked to certain traits is assumed to be universal, the content of these linkages can be culturally and temporally specific. We suggest that traits become conflated with gender identity when they are endorsed by a gender group and differentiate one gender from the other. This process can lead to active avoidance of a trait by those who feel their gender identity is incompatible with that trait. In sum, we believe there is value in drawing on broader theories of self, identity, and social groups to best understand how people come to define themselves and are defined by gender.",2015,,Sex Roles,73,11-12,474-480,1732538427,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0536-3,,#579,Schmader 2015,"",""

The link between fear of failure and students' antisocial behaviour has received scant research attention despite associations between fear of failure, hostility, and aggression. Also, the effect of sport experience on antisocial behaviour has not been considered outside of the sport context in adult populations. Further, to date, sex differences have not been considered in fear of failure research.Aims. To examine whether (a) fear of failure and sport experience predict antisocial behaviour in the university and sport contexts in student athletes, and whether this prediction is the same in males and females; and (b) sex differences exist in antisocial behaviour and fear of failure.Sample.

Applying Multilevel Modeling to Understand Individual and Cross-Cultural Variations in Attitudes Toward Homosexual People Across 28 European Countries,"Donaldson, CD; Handren, LM; Lac, A","Individual and cross-cultural factors associated with attitudes toward homosexual people were examined in this study. Using cross-sectional data from the sixth biennial European Social Survey, which represents 36,959 individuals nested within 28 European countries, successive nested models were tested using multilevel modeling (MLM). Results found that attitudes varied cross-culturally as a function of people's country of residence-this clustering effect was controlled for in all subsequent models. Individual-level predictors (Level 1) of male gender, older age, less education, being an immigrant to one's residing country, conservative political affiliation, high religiosity, perceptions that politics in one's country were unfair, low openness to change values, low self-transcendence values, high conservation values, and high self-enhancement values were significantly linked with anti-homosexuality attitudes. At the country level (Level 2), a high emphasis on social conservatism and fewer civil rights for homosexuals was connected with more unfavorable attitudes. Findings indicate main effects of predictors at both levels; however, country-level variables tended to yield stronger coefficients than individual-level factors, highlighting the contributions of macro-and microfactors in simultaneously shaping attitudes toward homosexuality. Beyond these effects, interactions of country-and individual-level variables show political affiliation, religiosity, self-enhancement values as stronger predictors in liberal countries, but openness to change values, younger age, and higher education as stronger predictors in conservative countries. Implications are discussed for understanding the wide continuum of views toward homosexuality across people and countries.",2017,,JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY,48,1,93-112,WOS:000391579300007,10.1177/0022022116672488,,#590,Donaldson 2017,"",""
The Failure of Gender Equality Initiatives in Academia: Exploring Defensive Institutional Work in Flemish Universities,"Roos, H; Mampaey, J; Huisman, J; Luyckx, J","Although a large number of studies have explored the main causes of gender inequality in academia, less attention has been given to the processes underlying the failure of gender equality initiatives to enhance gender representation, especially at the professorial level.

"The Diversity Challenge: Exploring the ""Invisible College"" of International Arbitration","Franck, SD; Freda, J; Lavin, K; Lehmann, T; van Aaken, A","As diversity can affect the perceived legitimacy of a state's dispute resolution system and the quality of judicial decisions, diversity levels in the national bench and bar have been an area of transnational concern. By contrast, little is known about diversity of adjudicators and counsel in international arbitration. With a lack of accurate, complete, and publicly available data about international arbitrators and practitioners, speculation about membership in the ""invisible college"" of international arbitration abounds. Using data from a survey of attendees at the prestigious and elite biennial Congress of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration permitted one glimpse into the membership of the international arbitration community. Although defining the international arbitration community is challenging, rather than leave the ""invisible college"" unexamined, this Article offers one systematic glimpse into the global elites of international arbitration using data from 413 subjects who served as counsel and 262 who acted as arbitrators (including 67 investment treaty arbitrators). The median international arbitrator was a fifty-three year old man who was a national of a developed state reporting ten arbitral appointments; and the median counsel was a forty-six year old man who was a national of a developed state and had served as counsel in fifteen arbitrations. In addition: (1) 17.6% of the arbitrators were women, and there was a significant age difference such that male arbitrators were approximately ten years older than women; (2) for those acting as international arbitrators, we could not identify a significant difference in the number of appointments women and men obtained; (3) depending upon how development status was defined, developing world arbitrators accounted for fifteen to twenty percent of arbitrators; and (4) for all measures used to analyze development status, arbitrators from the developing world received a statistically lower number of appointments than their developed world counterparts. Recognizing the data revealed diversity in international arbitration is a complex phenomenon, the data nevertheless supported, rather than disproved, claims that international arbitration is a relatively homogenous group. Acknowledging that international arbitration may improve over time and diversity issues challenge other forms of dispute resolution, diversity levels in international arbitration were somewhat lower than in several national court systems but were generally reflective of diversity levels in other international courts and tribunals. The international arbitration community seems aware of the distortions. For all subjects, 57.5% either somewhat or strongly agreed that international arbitration experiences challenges related to gender, nationality, or age. Younger subjects and women were statistically more likely to identify) such challenges as compared to older or male subjects; but subjects from states outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were less likely to identify challenges when compared to their OECD counterparts. Replication is necessary as the results may reflect a limited historical baseline of international arbitration global elites. Given the self-identified concerns and the symbolic legitimacy of broader representation, the international arbitration community may wish to explore factors inhibiting full utilization of untapped talent and facilitate aims of procedural, and potentially distributive, justice.Structural and incremental strategies could then promote a sustainable international arbitration system for the future.",2015,,COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW,53,3,429-506,WOS:000357358700001,,,#593,Franck 2015,"",""
"Earning Professional Legitimacy: Challenges Faced by Women, Underrepresented Minority, and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty","O'Meara, K; Templeton, L; Nyunt, G","Background and Context: Little research has focused on how legitimacy is understood and conveyed through interactions between faculty colleagues, despite its importance to faculty careers. Not all faculty experience an even playing field in trying to access professional legitimacy. This is especially true for women, underrepresented minority (URM), and nontenure-track (NTT) faculty. These groups experience common dilemmas in their pursuit of professional legitimacy in research university environments, though each group also faces distinct challenges of its own. An ideal place to understand experiences of faculty trying to earn professional legitimacy are faculty learning communities.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze how women, URM, and NTT faculty understand and describe professional legitimacy in one research university. We sought to understand the challenges these groups experienced in trying to obtain legitimacy from colleagues that they attributed to their gender, race, or appointment type. Through this study, we hope to provide an understanding of and recommendations for creating inclusive academic work environments for all three groups.Setting: The study took place at Land Grant University (LGU), a research-intensive institution. LGU received a National Science Foundation ADVANCE grant to focus on issues of equity in the retention and advancement of women and URM faculty. Out of recognition that the institution faced challenges in retaining and/or advancing women, URM, and NTT faculty. LGU's ADVANCE program created faculty learning communities.Research Design: A qualitative case study approach was used to understand how women, URM, and NTT faculty interpreted institutional scripts of legitimacy within their academic departments.Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected using semistructured participant observations of five faculty learning communities, which were formed to support the retention and advancement of women, URM, and NTT faculty over five years.Findings/Results: Women, URM, and NTT faculty participating in faculty learning communities understood profession legitimacy as associated with belonging, merit, autonomy, and voice in decision making. Participants described multiple ways in which they felt their gender, race, and/or appointment type constrained their ability to achieve legitimacy.Conclusions and Recommendations: In this study, we used our findings to ""mark"" how inequality is maintained through professional interactions with colleagues. Implicit bias influenced several of the inequalities and barriers to earning legitimacy noted in the study. One recommendation, therefore, is to raise awareness of implicit bias and provide department-wide trainings on how to address it. This study also supports the use of faculty learning communities as a place of restoration for faculty seeking professional legitimacy and as a tool to create inclusive academic environments.",2018,,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,120,12,,WOS:000460790100008,,,#594,O'Meara 2018,"",""
Struggles for medical legitimacy among women experiencing sexual pain: A qualitative study,"Braksmajer, A","Given the prominent role of medical institutions in defining what is healthy and normal, many women turn to medicine when experiencing pain during intercourse (dyspareunia). The medical encounter can become a contest between patients and providers when physicians do not grant legitimacy to patients' claims of illness. Drawing on interviews conducted from 2007 to 2008 and 2011 to 2012 with 32 women experiencing dyspareunia (ages 18-60years) and living in New York City and its surrounding areas, this study examined women's and their physicians' claims regarding bodily expertise, particularly women's perceptions of physician invalidation, their understanding of this invalidation as gendered, and the consequences for women's pursuit of medicalization. Women overwhelmingly sought a medical diagnosis for their dyspareunia, in which they believed that providers would relieve uncertainty about its origin, give treatment alternatives, and permit them to avoid sexual activity. When providers did not give diagnoses, women reported feeling that their bodily self-knowledge was dismissed and their symptoms were attributed to psychosomatic causes. Furthermore, some women linked their perceptions of invalidation to both historical and contemporary forms of gender bias. Exploration of women's struggles for medical legitimacy may lead to a better understanding of the processes by which medicalization of female sexuality takes place.",2018,,WOMEN & HEALTH,58,4,419-433,WOS:000428207500004,10.1080/03630242.2017.1306606,,#595,Braksmajer 2018,"",""
White-collar crime in academia: Trends in digital academic dishonesty over time and their effect on penalty severity,"Etgar, S; Blau, I; Eshet-Alkalai, Y","This study explored patterns of change over time in penalties for conducting academic dishonesty (AD), following a previous study (Friedman Blau & Eshet-Alkalai, 2016) that reported lower penalties for digital AD offenses compared to analog ones across two years. In the present study, we examined whether this trend changes over time, and what could explain it. We offered two contradicting hypotheses: the regulations hypothesis suggests that the gap between penalties for analog and digital AD caused since it takes time for academic institutes to adjust their regulations to digital dishonesties. Therefore, this gap will diminish and eventually disappear. The perception hypothesis suggests that the penalty gap will remain stable, since it reflects the perception of digital AD as a ""white-collar"" offense. Contrary to previous studies that used self-reported measurements of AD perceptions, this study analyzed Disciplinary Committees protocols, which contains a more objective descriptions of type of AD, student's explanations, and penalty types. These protocols provide information about the actual behavior of students and faculty, and not about their opinions. We analyzed the entire volume of 628 university's protocols collected during four consecutive years. Findings clearly demonstrated that the trend of lower penalties for digital offenses remained stable across four years. Results support the perception hypothesis, suggest that this phenomenon relates to the perception of digital AD as a ""white-collar crime"". Like other white-collar crimes, is perceived as less harmful and therefore, punished less severely than other crimes. This claim is also supported by our findings that motivations to behave unethically, which students reported to the Discipline Committee, influenced penalties' severity in analog, but not in digital settings. Unexpectedly, a consistent gender-gap was found in penalties' severity for both digital and analog offenses, indicating that women were punished more severely than men. This dissimilarity in penalizing AD offenses remained stable over the studied period.

Public satisfaction with health care system in 30 countries: The effects of individual characteristics and social contexts,"Yuan, YQ","In this article, the associations among individual socio-economic characteristics, the institutional set-up of health care systems, and satisfaction with the health care system are investigated. Data from the 2011 International Social Survey Program (30 countries, 34,212 respondents) is used. Multilevel analyses across countries have shown how the state financing context affects satisfaction at the individual level. Consistent with previous research, at individual level, personal experiences with medical providers, age, gender as well as income are significant predictors of satisfaction with the health care system. At the country level, real input indicators such as density of physicians and density of hospital beds are negative predictors of satisfaction with the health care system whereas the percentage of total health expenditures comprised by public sources is a positive predictor of satisfaction with the health care system. However, findings from the cross-level interactions indicate that the negative effect of lower income is more prominent in predominantly publicly-funded health care systems. Specifically, in primarily publicly funded health care systems, the model-predicted probability of satisfaction with the health care system is higher, but the gap in the probability of satisfaction with the health care system between individuals with lower income and those with higher income is greater than that in mostly privately-financed health care systems. The findings in this study suggest that the future direction of health care system reform should be focused on balancing the distribution of resources between private and public sectors.

Rethinking doctoral qualifying exams and candidacy in the physical sciences: Learning toward scientific legitimacy,"Liera, R; Rodgers, AJ; Irwin, LN; Posselt, JR","There is growing awareness that established structures of higher education are often predicated on problematic assumptions about merit, excellence, and rigor. Doctoral qualifying exams, for example, are required to advance to candidacy in many Ph.D. programs despite decades of documented concerns about the implications of standard modes for student equity and well-being. As more Ph.D. programs move to reform these exams and candidacy requirements, it is important to understand how Ph.D. programs, as academic organizations, construct the significance of the qualifying exam. A sociocultural lens suggests qualifying exams and the learning that enables their passage are symbolic rituals that move doctoral students from legitimate peripheral participation toward full membership and belonging in academic communities of practice. We conducted a comparative case study to understand how two Ph.D. programs in the physical sciences that have reformed their candidacy requirements-one elite and one middle ranked but striving for respect-constructed the significance and purpose of their qualifying exam and the broader transition to candidacy. Our inquiry included the contexts and mechanisms that mediated student learning. Through interviews with faculty, staff, and students, we found that the Ph.D. programs' recognition of their status within their respective disciplines emerged as a crucial component in constructions about the significance of exams and candidacy. The middle-ranked Ph.D. program changed the exam and candidacy structure to reflect legitimate practices in their discipline. The elite Ph.D. program created multiple pathways toward candidacy to mitigate long-standing concerns about gender equity and student well-being.

Communicating About Affirmative Consent: How the Threat of Punishment Affects Policy Support and Gender Stereotypes,"Tinkler, JE; Clay-Warner, J; Alinor, M","Colleges are increasingly adopting affirmative consent policies, which require students to obtain conscious and voluntary consent at each stage of sexual activity. Although this is an important step forward in violence prevention, very little is known about how best to present the policies to students. This is important, as research on sexual harassment policy training finds that training can reinforce traditional gender beliefs, which undermines policy goals. Building on this literature, we argue that affirmative consent policy trainings emphasizing punishment will increase support for affirmative consent but will reinforce traditional gender beliefs. We tested our predictions with an experiment in which we randomly assigned undergraduate participants to one of three conditions where they read an excerpt of (a) an affirmative consent policy that emphasized the threat of punishment, (b) an affirmative consent policy that emphasized a normative/moral message, or (c) an ergonomic workstation policy that served as our control condition. We found that punishment framing increased men's support for the policy, had no effect on their likelihood to comply, and increased their perception that most people hold men to be more powerful than women. For women, the punishment and normative framings increased support equally, but the normative framing actually decreased likelihood to comply. The policy conditions had no effect on women's gender beliefs. The results suggest that while an emphasis on punishment can help legitimate nonconsensual sex as a social problem, it will not necessarily increase college students' compliance with affirmative consent, and runs the risk of activating essentialist stereotypes about gender difference.

Despite treatment guidelines and consensus recommendations, variability in clinical practice referral decisions persists. Evidence from other conditions suggests such clinical decision making is impacted by practitioners' implicit and explicit attitudes. We aimed to identify whether health care professionals hold implicit and/or explicit attitudes about the legitimacy of FND and whether these attitudes are associated with referral decision making. Design/MethodsWe included 66 health care professionals who work with people with neurological conditions: n = 37 medical doctors, mainly neurologists (n = 18) and psychiatrists (n = 10), and n = 29 doctoral level practitioner psychologists. Participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a referral decision-making vignette task and self-report measures of explicit attitudes on FND-legitimacy, therapeutic optimism and clinician confidence. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was used as a comparator condition. ResultsParticipants self-reported strong explicit FND-legitimate and MS-legitimate attitudes but demonstrated an implicit FND-illegitimate/MS-legitimate bias. Deeper examination provided by the IRAP data indicated pro-FND-legitimate attitudes, but no bias for or against FND-illegitimate-contrasting the pro-MS-legitimate, anti-MS-illegitimate attitudes for the comparator condition. Attitudes about FND-illegitimacy were negatively associated with likelihood of referral to physical interventions such as physiotherapy. Medical doctors had lower treatment optimism and stronger explicit attitudes that FND is illegitimate than psychologists.

We argue that the certification programmes obfuscate the deteriorating relations between the state and the farmers and enable the private firms to gain foothold and affirm their operational legitimacy and market links with smallholders.

Feeling guilty to remain innocent: the moderating effect of sex on guilt responses to rule-violating behavior in adolescent legal socialization,"Cole, LM; Cohn, ES; Rebellon, CJ; Van Gundy, KT","Legal socialization researchers have ignored the role of emotions such as guilt to explain rule-violating behavior (RVB).

Correlations indicated that both measures were related significantly to RVB; however, when both were entered into a multiple regression as predictors, only anticipated guilt was significant. This suggested that anticipated guilt was a stronger predictor of RVB than guilt proneness. The purpose of Study 2 was to investigate the effects of anticipated guilt on future RVB while controlling for the integrated legal socialization variables.

"Women inside and outside Academia: a struggle to access knowledge, legitimacy and influence","Romito, P; Volpato, C","Starting from the observation that women still represent a minority in the higher echelons of universities and scientific institutions, the article discusses a number of strategies used to ""keep them out"". Historically the main strategy was to refuse to admit women. This refusal was accompanied by discourses devaluing women's intellectual capacities, while stressing their domestic and motherly duties, and by the actual burdening of women with these duties. When women succeeded in entering universities, subsequent strategies have been the appropriation by men of women's scientific production, sexual harassment (going as far as physical elimination) and anti-feminist intellectual harassment. Notwithstanding this strong opposition, during the last 3 0 years scientific production by women and feminists has been extensive, of high quality and innovative, This knowledge has advanced our understanding of important scientific and social problems, benefited both men and women, and contributed in some cases to a limitation of traditional male privileges.",2005,,SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION SUR LES SCIENCES SOCIALES,44,1,41-63,WOS:000227373000003,10.1177/0539018405050440,,#609,Romito 2005,"",""

Although there is recognition that certain research topics struggle to gain legitimacy, the process through which this struggle is sustained remains unclear. To shed light on these dynamics, we analyzed data from an interview study of 31 gender in management scholars located on five continents. We find that gender in management scholarship is granted varying degrees of exchange, procedural, and comprehensibility legitimacy by both academic and non-academic groups. In response to these conflicting legitimacies, gender scholars are subsequently subjected to multiple rhetorical delegitimation strategies by the dominant academic community. To explain how these dynamics persist, we outline an overall process model of the under-legitimation of a research topic comprising four components: value-incongruence, mixed-legitimation, delegitimation, and negative outcomes for the production and dissemination of knowledge. Further, we introduce the concept of privilege legitimacy to describe the distinctive legitimacy afforded to the research topic by male gender in management scholars.

Invariance of the Reputation Emotional Index <i>RepTrak Pulse</i>: A Study Validation on Generational Change,"Alloza-Losana, A; Carreras-Romero, E","Reputation takes on special relevance for companies and organizations at a time when the traditional model of short-term capitalism is being redefined and focused on moving from short term to the creation of long-term value and creating value for all stakeholders. This approach requires demonstrating with metrics the benefits that long-term creation produces and precisely, a key performance indicator (KPI) that addresses this need of demonstrating empirically the long-term value is reputation. Nowadays, the rising value of company-intangible assets and resources such as reputation has increased academic interest in the methodological properties of such metrics which are being object of monitoring and management. One of these properties is the invariance of the metric between the different demographic groups composing the population. The invariance of the corporate intangible metrics is an essential requirement for a correct interpretation of reputation results surveys, especially in those indices such as RepTrakPulsethat measure overall reputation on a broad demographic spectrum. The populational invariance guarantees that individual RepTrakPulsescores might be aggregated to other population samples because everyone is expressing the same underlying feeling. The classic tests about reliability and validity of the RepTrakPulsemetric do not deal with this issue and therefore, the invariance analysis becomes a complementary and necessary test that allows legitimately to make usePulsescores at populational level. In 2011, Ponzi, Fombrun and Gardberg demonstrated that the RepTrakPulsewas valid and reliable in several countries. However, they did not verify the population invariance of this metric. Four years later, this deficiency was corrected, demonstrating the invariance of the ReptrakPulseby sex, age, and educational level by Alloza (2015). The populational invariance guarantees that Pulse scores variations reflect real feeling changes and not changes due to variations in the demographic composition of survey samples. Our current research aims to reinforce the robustness of RepTrakPulseindex by checking the degree of invariance with respect to a variable that often goes unnoticed in thePulsefollow-up, namely case of the generational group. The generational effect should not be confused with that of age, even though they are related. Generations imply specific ways of understanding and reacting to the world that could interact the notion ofPulseshared by each generational group and could invalidate the temporal comparison. Thus, here we examine the degree of invariance that ReptrakPulsehas by generation. To separate the effect between generation and age the ""time-lag method"" was applied to the invariance analysis in two cross-sectional samples (in 2006 and 2017). Data proceeding from 9000 interviews were analyzed in Spain, France, Germany, Canada, Brazil and Japan.

Assessment of Diversity Outcomes in American Medical School Admissions: Applying the Grutter Legitimacy Principles,"Baugh, A; Baugh, RF","In the last 30 years, except for female participation, the enrollment of Latinx, African Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan natives, and disadvantaged students in medical school has been constant; however, increasing enrollment of these minority populations is feasible, if admissions committees make two changes in approach. First, the traditional belief that matriculation merit is a linear function of past academic performance must be rejected. Second, once the threshold needed to complete medical school in four years and to pass licensing examinations at the first attempt has been met, all candidates are equally qualified, and matriculation decisions must be based, in part, on societal interests. In Grutter vs. Bollinger, the United States Supreme Court determined that graduate admission committees can and should consider societal interests. Each admission decision represents a substantial government investment in each student, as the Medicare Act directly subsidizes much of the cost of medical education. As Grutter explained, there is a societal interest in the public having confidence in, and access to, the medical school training that will prepare tomorrow's medical, professional, and political leaders. Our analysis suggests that medical school admissions are biased towards academic achievement in matriculants, beyond acceptable thresholds for graduation and licensure.

The critical importance of communication has been growing with the increasing size of organizations owing to the vast economic development all across the world. In this scenario, the medium of communication and the factors that affect the time to communicate are of utmost importance.Researchers have identified three factors that mainly affect communication in an organization. They are gender, level of employee in the organization, and sense of urgency conveyed in the message. To date, these factors have been considered separately; their interaction effects have not been studied in depth.This research analyzes these three factors using a designed experiment in a technical organization, where response time is the response variable and the three factors are experimental variables. The organization chosen was the University of Minnesota Duluth. An experimental design approach was followed as it provides control over bias and uncertainties.The results show that gender has a statistically significant effect, at alpha = 0.05, on the communication in technical organizations when any of the three media (Email, Voice Mail and Memo) was used. The sense of urgency affected the time to respond in email, but no effect was found in voice mail and memo.

Epistemic exclusion: A theory for understanding racism in faculty research evaluations,Settles I.H.; ; Jones M.K.; Buchanan N.T.; Dotson K.; Grower P.; O'Rourke M.; Rinkus M.; Latimer K.,"Despite institutional efforts, growth in the number of faculty of color has largely plateaued, limiting research innovation and other benefits of diversity. In this article, we seek to understand structural barriers to faculty equity by (a) detailing a theory of epistemic exclusion within academia and (b) applying the theory of epistemic exclusion to the specific context of faculty departmental reviews of scholarly research (e.g., annual review, promotion and tenure review). Epistemic exclusion is a form of scholarly devaluation that is rooted in disciplinary biases about the qualities of rigorous research and identity-based biases about the competence of marginalized group members. These biases work in tandem to systemically and disproportionately exclude marginalized scholars (e.g., people of color, women) from the academy. In the context of faculty departmental reviews, epistemic exclusion can happen in formal systems of evaluation through criteria, metric, and application exclusion. It can also occur informally during interpersonal interactions and communications through legitimacy, contribution, and comprehension exclusion. In this article, we detail each of these types of exclusion, how they may interact with each other, and their consequences. We assert that epistemic exclusion threatens the diversification of academia and offer suggestions for equitable evaluation practices and reducing epistemic exclusion within higher education broadly.

The gender and culture effect on the CO<ovid:inf>2</ovid:inf> emission empirical analysis,Zhang Y.; ; Chen K.; Zou C.,"In recent years, the world has been facing severe challenges from climate change and environmental issues, with carbon dioxide emissions being considered one of the main driving factors. Many studies have proven that activities in various industries and fields have a significant impact on carbon dioxide emissions. However, few studies have explored the impact of gender on carbon dioxide emissions. This study aims to explore the potential impact of gender diversity on carbon dioxide emissions in the boards of directors of developed and emerging market enterprises. In addition, we also analyzed how board cultural diversity affects carbon dioxide emissions. We searched two European indices provided by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) from the Bloomberg database and conducted empirical analysis. We selected the MSCI index and MSCI emerging market index from 2010 to 2019 as samples and thoroughly cleaned up the data by removing any observations containing missing information on any variables. Statistical methods such as t-test, ordinary least squares, panel data analysis, regression analysis, and robustness testing were used for statistical analysis. At the same time, differential testing was conducted on sensitive and non-sensitive sectors, and the average representation of female boards in sensitive industries was low. The research results show that the proportion of female members on a company's board of directors is negatively correlated with carbon dioxide emissions. This discovery is consistent with the legitimacy theory advocating for gender equality and environmental sustainability, emphasizing the importance of gender diversity in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, agency theory suggests that diversity may lead to internal conflicts within a company, leading to agency costs and information asymmetry. The research results show a negative correlation between board cultural diversity and carbon dioxide emissions, indicating the potential challenge of board cultural diversity. This study provides important insights for decision-makers and managers, not only inspiring corporate social responsibility and environmental policy formulation, but also of great significance for academic research in the field of climate change. Our research findings help deepen our understanding of the factors that affect carbon dioxide emissions in different sectors and countries, while also expanding the research field between gender diversity, cultural diversity, and environmental sustainability. Although this study still needs to be further expanded and deepened, it provides useful insights into the relationship between board gender and cultural diversity and carbon dioxide emissions.<ovid:br/>Copyright: &#xa9; 2024 Zhang et al.",2024,/,PLoS ONE,19,2 February,e0296121,2030443271,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296121,38354124,#635,Zhang 2024,"",""
Evaluating attitudes among healthcare graduate students following interprofessional education on opioid use disorder,Karagiannis C.; ; Liang J.; Pierre S.S.; Brody C.; Kinnevey C.,"CONTEXT: Provider-enacted stigma is a barrier for people with substance use disorder (SUD) who interface with the healthcare system, and it has been shown to lead to worse healthcare outcomes. This has given urgency to the need for stigma reduction interventions such as education- and contact-based approaches. The positive effect of interprofessional education (IPE) in reducing graduate health students' stigmatizing attitudes on opioids has been examined before, and we contribute to the existing literature by examining the attitudes across the following four health disciplines-osteopathic medicine, physician assistant (PA) studies and public health, pharmacy, and nursing-following a single half-day IPE event focused on opioid use disorder (OUD). <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): We aimed to determine whether attitudes could be affected by the IPE event by assessing attitudes utilizing an adapted version of the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perceptions Questionnaire (AAPPQ) before and after the IPE event. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A total of 647 students across the four previously mentioned health disciplines participated in the IPE event. Attitudes were compared between the pre/post groups utilizing unpaired t tests, and a summative ""all-attitudes"" score was generated, with higher scores being associated with improved attitudes toward individuals with an OUD. Linear regression was performed controlling for program type, gender, and previous OUD exposure (personal, professional, and education). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): We found that the pre/post summative attitudes scores improved an average of 2.81 units (SD 0.87, p=0.001, CI 1.09-4.52) for the entire cohort of graduate health students (56.9 vs. 66.6, p<0.0001) and for all attitudinal subscales (role adequacy, role legitimacy, role support, task-specific self-esteem, and work satisfaction). Students from PA programs had significantly higher attitude scores than other programs, and there were differences in degree type on attitude scores, with an average decrease of 1.89 units in attitude scores (SE 0.38, p<0.0001, CI -2.64 to -1.16). We found that students with previous exposure to OUD had higher pre-IPE event scores than those without, and knowing someone impacted by an SUD was a significant predictor of increased attitude scores, by an average of 3.82 units (SE 0.27, p<0.0001, CI 3.49-4.16). However, students without previous exposure to OUD had equal attitude scores post event to those who had previous exposure to OUD through education, personal experience, or training. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that an IPE intervention and panel discussion may improve attitudes toward people with OUD in healthcare trainees, which is consistent with previous research that shows the beneficial effect of education and contact in reducing stigma. Degree type and knowing someone who has been impacted by an SUD are also significant predictors of attitude scores. IPE events are useful in targeting a public health issue by encouraging collaboration between different health professionals at early stages of their training, and preclinical educational efforts can affect therapeutic attitudes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",2024,/,Journal of osteopathic medicine,124,2,85EP  - 93,643346729,https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jom-2023-0132,37786926,#636,Karagiannis 2024,"",""
Universities claim to value community-engaged scholarship: So why do they discourage it?,Bell M.; ; Lewis N.,"With current crises of academic relevance and legitimacy, there is a need for epistemic equity inherent to community-engaged research. Scholars in science communication and science and technology studies have analyzed, advocated for, and conducted public engagement in pursuit of this goal. However, despite desires to celebrate public engagement, US academic institutions and organizations often present barriers to meaningful community-engaged research. From tenure and promotion requirements, to lack of recognition and resources, universities in the American academic landscape are not currently organized to support such work. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework to examine the complex structural dimensions of academic institutions that have systematically discouraged and devalued faculty participation in community-engaged scholarship. We outline four such structural dimensions: interrogating epistemic biases, neoliberalist tendencies, gendered norms, and colonial-racist defaults.

Understanding how faculty make return-to-learn decisions for college students,Bevilacqua Z.W.; ; Rich J.; Henry T.J.,"BACKGROUND: College faculty are receiving attention as influential members of the Return-to-Learn (RTL) process for students with concussion. Investigators continue to learn more about how faculty can assist students throughout recovery, yet we must also strive to determine whether such evidence is isolated or is in fact exhibited by faculty elsewhere. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): We sought to determine if successive faculty cohorts demonstrate similar perspectives and RTL decision-making profiles as those from initial investigations. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Two universities in New York State were recruited to participate in a two-stage cross-sectional study. College faculty with teaching responsibilities were given the opportunity to complete an online Qualtrics survey followed by a private interview discussing their thoughts, perspectives, and/or experiences with managing students with concussion. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Accommodations for students were allowed more often when some form of documentation was present (disability services note = 100%; multiple types of proof = 91%; doctor/medical notes = 90%; and no note = 75%). Three factors consistently scored as influential to faculty RTL decision-making: documentation, teacher-student relationship, and empathy. No significant differences in scoring were seen between male and female faculty participants. Follow-up interviews revealed two themes: legitimacy and empathy. Legitimacy outlines why faculty seek verification of concussion prior to allowing accommodations and includes two subthemes: i) note/documentation, and ii) fairness/protecting integrity. Empathy discusses how and why faculty empathetically assist students with concussion, and includes two subthemes: i) personality, and ii) past experiences/understanding of concussion. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our findings indicate that faculty from different universities display similar RTL decision-making tendencies and perspectives towards students with concussion as those from initial investigations. These data allow RTL stakeholders to better understand and appreciate the potential for faculty to act as facilitators to concussion support. As gatekeepers of the classroom environment, understanding how to produce faculty cooperation will ensure a reproducible and positive outcome for students recovering from concussion.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 - IOS Press.

Should AI allocate livers for transplant? Public attitudes and ethical considerations,Drezga-Kleiminger M.; ; Demaree-Cotton J.; Koplin J.; Savulescu J.; Wilkinson D.,"BACKGROUND: Allocation of scarce organs for transplantation is ethically challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to assist in liver allocation, however the ethics of this remains unexplored and the view of the public unknown. The aim of this paper was to assess public attitudes on whether AI should be used in liver allocation and how it should be implemented. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We first introduce some potential ethical issues concerning AI in liver allocation, before analysing a pilot survey including online responses from 172 UK laypeople, recruited through Prolific Academic. FINDINGS: Most participants found AI in liver allocation acceptable (69.2%) and would not be less likely to donate their organs if AI was used in allocation (72.7%). Respondents thought AI was more likely to be consistent and less biased compared to humans, although were concerned about the ""dehumanisation of healthcare"" and whether AI could consider important nuances in allocation decisions. Participants valued accuracy, impartiality, and consistency in a decision-maker, more than interpretability and empathy. Respondents were split on whether AI should be trained on previous decisions or programmed with specific objectives. Whether allocation decisions were made by transplant committee or AI, participants valued consideration of urgency, survival likelihood, life years gained, age, future medication compliance, quality of life, future alcohol use and past alcohol use. On the other hand, the majority thought the following factors were not relevant to prioritisation: past crime, future crime, future societal contribution, social disadvantage, and gender. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): There are good reasons to use AI in liver allocation, and our sample of participants appeared to support its use. If confirmed, this support would give democratic legitimacy to the use of AI in this context and reduce the risk that donation rates could be affected negatively. Our findings on specific ethical concerns also identify potential expectations and reservations laypeople have regarding AI in this area, which can inform how AI in liver allocation could be best implemented.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

Qualitative study of Oncology Clinicians' Perceptions of Barriers to Offering Clinical Trials to Underserved Populations,Perez G.K.; ; Oberoi A.R.; Finkelstein-Fox L.; Park E.R.; Nipp R.D.; Moy B.,"Introduction: Cancer clinical trials represent the ""gold standard"" for advancing novel cancer therapies. Optimizing trial participation is critical to ensuring the generalizability of findings across patients, yet trial enrollment rates, particularly among minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, remain suboptimal. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted in-depth interviews with oncologists at a large academic medical center to explore their (1) attitudes and perceived barriers to offering clinical trials to minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and (2) recommendations for improving the enrollment of minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in cancer clinical trials. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 23 medical oncologists approached, 17 enrolled (74% response rate; mean age = 47; female = 42%; White = 67%). Content analysis revealed several barriers to enrollment: (1) ethical dilemmas; (2) ambivalence about trial risks and benefits; and (3) concern about patient well-being. Concerns about the legitimacy of informed consent, perceived lack of equipoise, and fear of personal bias influenced clinicians' decisions to recommend trials during treatment discussions. Concerns about creating an imbalance between trial risks and benefits among patients with high-level needs, including patients with literacy, psychiatric, and other socioeconomic vulnerabilities, impacted clinicians' enthusiasm to engage in trial discussions. Clinicians identified patient, provider, and system-level solutions to address challenges, including increasing patient and clinician support as well as involving external personnel to support trial enrollment. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Findings reveal multi-level barriers to offering cancer clinical trials to underrepresented patients. Targeted solutions, including system level changes to support clinicians, patient financial support, and implementation of clinical trial navigation programs were recommended to help reduce access barriers and increase enrollment of underrepresented patients into cancer clinical trials.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.",2023,/,Cancer Control,30,"(Perez, Finkelstein-Fox, Park, Moy) Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States(Perez, Finkelstein-Fox, Park) MGH Health Promotion and Resiliency Intervention Research Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, ",,2025490698,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10732748231187829,37724824,#640,Perez 2023,"",""
THE ADDED VALUE OF A NATIONAL ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE MEDICATION HISTORY OBTAINED BY A CLINICAL PHARMACIST,Szilvay A.; ; Czako E.; Pazmany P.; Richter K.,"Background and Importance Obtaining the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) is an essential step in the medication reconciliation process, that should ideally be based on the most appropriate sources of information, such as patient health records, to which access is often limited. Implementation of a National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system aims at streamlining this process by converging relevant data into a singular database. Aim and Objectives This research aimed to assess the added value of NEHR to BPMH. In addition, the quality of NEHRbased BPMH was compared to the former physician/nurse-led Standard of Care (SoC), in order to explore the added value of clinical pharmacy services in obtaining BPMHs. Material and Methods The study took place between 05.2022- 08.2022 in the general surgery department of a county hospital, enrolling patients over 18 years of age, admitted from their homes, with at least one regularly taken prescribed medication and without major communication difficulties. Medication reconciliation was initiated by clinical pharmacists, based on the documentation available at the point-of-care ('Hospital list'), which in turn got validated via NEHR data ('NEHR list'), with the final step being a patient interview, formulating the final medication list ('BPMH list'). Primary outcome metrics were the frequency and types of medication discrepancies derived from the comparison of the aforementioned lists, including the former SoC. Results The study included 100 patients (52% female, average age=62 years). 231 discrepancies were found between the NEHR list and the Hospital list (median=2; IQR=4), 64% of the patients being affected. The most common discrepancy was drug omission (65%) and incorrect daily dose (26%). There was an inconsistency between the BPMH list and the SoC in 90% of the patients (median=3; IQR=3), the most common errors being drug omission (41%) and incorrect daily dose (31%). Conclusion and Relevance Based on these results, the NEHR can contribute to the compilation of a more prudent BPMH due to its more comprehensive data content. This methodology may, in turn, facilitate the prevention of multiple medication- related errors. These outcomes also underline the legitimacy of pharmacists' access to such national systems.",2023,/,European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy,30,Supplement 1,A99EP  - A100,640966013,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-eahp.209,,#641,Szilvay 2023,"",""

Morality and Legitimacy: Understanding Racially Diverse Perceptions of Bariatric Surgery,Chao G.F.; ; Byrnes M.E.; Ghaferi A.A.,"Background: There exists significant disparities in who receives bariatric surgery. Nationally, 70% of bariatric surgery patients are White women. However, Black and Hispanic populations are at higher risk for developing obesity. It is unclear why demographics of patients do not match the populations at risk for obesity. Previous studies have focused on physician, insurance, and medical factors that may impact the decision to undergo bariatric surgery. This study is the first qualitative study with a racially and ethnically diverse patient population to understand patient perceptions of bariatric surgery. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We interviewed 32 individuals who met NIH criteria for bariatric surgery but have never considered bariatric surgery. We purposively sampled to ensure the majority of participants were Black and/or Hispanic. An exploratory, iterative method was used to code transcribed interviews. We then employed an interpretive framework to arrive at our final themes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Participants self-identified as 88% female, 75% Black, 3% Hispanic, 3% Pacific Islander, and 19% White. Three major themes emerged from our data. When examining responses, two themes were consistent across participants regardless of race/ethnicity. First, participants described being overweight as moral failure that should be resolved through discipline of the body. Participants-social context constructs being overweight as a visible sign of weakness, a personal inability to control appetite and diet. Thus, surgery was ""cheating,"" contributing to its being considered one of last resort. Second, bariatric surgery was often not seen as component of mainstream medicine. It was viewed as offered at ""places that may not be real hospitals"" or something done in a foreign country. An important factor decreasing legitimacy for most participants was that their physicians had never mentioned bariatric surgery. Finally, among Black participants, fear of disfigurement was a major deterrent. These included concerns regarding excess skin, an unhealthy ""hollowed out look,"" and being too small or ""skinny skinny."" <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Though bariatric surgery is a safe, effective, and durable therapy for patients with obesity; the majority of individuals we interviewed face feelings of moral failure and concerns over the legitimacy of bariatric surgery. Thus, healthcare providers may be instrumental in 1) shifting from a discourse of moral failure towards one focused on health and 2) increasing education of providers and the public of bariatric surgery's role in obesity treatment.

The mental health and wellbeing of Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URMs),von Werthern M.; ; Grigorakis G.; Vizard E.,"Background: Today, almost half of all refugees worldwide are children and adolescents, nearly a quarter of whom arrive in Europe as Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM). Many URMs have experienced the cumulative stress of being exposed both to the adverse environmental conditions which drive forced migration, and to the traumatic experience of displacement and resettlement. These experiences, coupled with other developmental stressors, may impede their overall development and increase their likelihood of mental health problems. Despite the evident vulnerability of URMs, much controversy currently surrounds the legitimacy of their arrival in host countries and their mental health is given little consideration. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This review synthesises and examines the limited published literature on the impact of traumatic refugee experiences on the mental health and development of URMs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Academic databases and other sources were searched using key terms relating to URMs and mental health. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The findings confirm in large part that being a URM negatively influences mental health development, and that adolescence and being female are particular indicators of increased risk of psychiatric disorders.

Experts' opinions on genome editing in humans: A collective construction of a disruptive technology,Romano V.; ; Howard H.C.,"Germ line genome editing (GLGE) is a highly controversial matter, tending to divide the expert community revolving around it. To date, very few studies have explored in-depth the views of expert stakeholders. To help fill this gap, we interviewed 20 expert stakeholders in genome editing (academic laboratory and clinical researchers, bioethicists, lawyers, patient advocates) from Europe, North America, China and Japan. In our semi-guided interviews, we posed, among others, questions addressing legitimacy, roles and responsibilities, engagement of the public about different uses, and future scenarios in so doing constructing a collective idea of what GLGE is and could be. About legitimate uses, we found that many stakeholders are skeptical about the need to use GLGE because of ethical implications, environmental risks and the existence of more safer alternatives. Roles and responsibilities are called to be horizontal and diffused as much as possible to everybody (through adequate representation). The participation of the wider public is considered essential for transgenerational ethical dilemmas. Future scenarios are depicted as negative for, above all, women and women's bodies, the meaning and actual impact of parenting, and the creation of wider inequalities between social classes. In general, we understood that certain views are common among experts, such as the extreme caution which should guide the path from the lab to clinical trials.

The clinical implication of this study is that physicians have a vested interest in the legitimacy of the data provided by these websites and other physician rating outlets.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; BY THE ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY 2017.",2017,/,Archives of Bone and Joint Surgery,5,3,139EP  - 144,615927307,https://dx.doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2017.16910.1425,,#649,Kirkpatrick 2017,"",""
UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE VILLAGE HEALTH SANITATION AND NUTRITION COMMITTEES IN NORTHERN INDIA,Scott K.; ; Sheikh K.; George A.; Garimella S.; Mondal S.; Patel G.; Ved R.,"Background Health committees are a popular strategy for facilitating community participation in health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Their potential effects are mediated by a number of factors including the contextual environment in which they function. George and colleagues1 in 2015 put forward a framework that identifies four contextual spheres - porous and interconnect - that are most relevant to health committees: community, health facility, health administration and society. We apply this framework to an in-depth contextual analysis of an intervention to strengthen Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) in rural north India, examining features in each sphere that influenced VHSNC outcomes. Methods Over the course of 18 months, 50 marginalised villages in a north Indian state received a government-designed and NGO-facilitated VHSNC support package, which included social mobilisation, VHSNC membership expansion, training and on-going facilitation for committee meetings and activities. Qualitative research through interviews (n=74), focus groups (n=18) and observation explored the contextual features that facilitated or hindered intensified community engagement by VHSNCs. Thematic network analysis enabled the identification and grouping of themes, and detailed exploration of subthemes. Findings VHSNCs attempted to improve access to drinking water, expand immunisation coverage, secure nurses, doctors, and medical supplies for health centres, and improve the functioning of village schools and Anganwadi centres. Most action took the form of writing appeals to various government officials. Some VHSNCs contributed to concrete improvements, namely having a doctor re-posted to a health centre and enabling school children to access government benefits (free bicycles and a scholarship for orphans), and many people appreciated learning about health topics and health rights. However, success was modest within the period under study (12 months) and although VHSNC members appreciated some aspects of the intervention, there was also significant disappointment. Within the community sphere, VHSNCs were challenged by social hierarchies that prevented people from speaking out about local issues. Women's active participation was particularly curtailed by community concerns that village-level monitoring would disturb social harmony and gender norms. In addition, communities exhibited deep mistrust of government institutions, which made people wary of investing in VHSNC. Within the health facility sphere, VHSNCs were hindered by the severely under-resourced health system. VHSNCs faced a need for increased support to enable frontline health workers to facilitate their functionality. Within the health administration sphere, block-level health functionaries often lacked the power to respond to VHSNC requests - particularly so for hiring additional nurses and doctors to fill vacancies - leaving VHSNCs unsure of how to bring about much needed change. The chain of responsibility for aspects of VHSNC administration was opaque, which, for example, made it difficult for VHSNCs to identify why their INR 10,000 (USD 150) yearly untied fund was not released throughout the 18 months period. Furthermore, despite VHSNCs' inter-sectorial nature - working on health, sanitation and nutrition - they struggled to involve diverse government services and were only officially mandated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In the societal sphere, despite decentralisation reforms that empowered the locally elected system of government (Panchayat), many VHSNCs were still unable to engage the powerful elected representative (Sarpanch), and instead worked with the lowest-level elected representative (Ward Panch), who they considered powerless. Media engagement emerged as a potential avenue to effect change. The prevalence of market solutions to fill gaps in government service provision (such as private health care, schools and wells) reduced the willingness of some people to work on VHSNC activities, since they were already paying for private services. Discussion & recommendations Active facilitation by a dedicated NGO enabled VHSNCs to work with or overcome many community-level challenges to become functioning local bodies that took action to improve local health. The VHSNC-support intervention succeeded in its core elements of expanding committee membership through a participatory process, training VHSNC members, facilitating monthly meetings and helping VHSNCs to take local actions for health. Yet major contextual barriers at the community, health facility, administration and societal levels limited VHSNCs' capacity to improve local health services. We identify features of a supportive environment for VHSNCs. At the community level, VHSNCs would be bolstered by greater legitimacy through early successes, an emphasis on collaborative and supportive local monitoring, and focused capacity building for female engagement. At the health facility level, VHSNCs need minimally functional health services which to engage. Filling healthcare staff vacancies must therefore be a priority. On-going support and incentives for frontline health functionaries to facilitate VHSNCs would institutionalize the VHSNCs' functionality. VHSNCs would be more effective if they were able to understand clear pathways of accountability for services, so that VHSNC members know where to go to seek change. Making VHSNC support and funding a top-down responsibility rather than a bottom-up battle is vital for VHSNC sustainability. Finally, inter-sectorial coordination of health, sanitation and nutrition at higher levels of government would generate a more VHSNC-enabling context. At the societal level, VHSNCs would benefit from additional decentralisation of power, so that ward members can take village-level action, from the development of media engagement strategies, and at the broadest level, from robust public funding for universal health, nutrition and sanitation services so that no one has to rely on the private sector to secure the basic requirements for health and wellbeing.",2016,/,BMJ Global Health,1,Supplement 1,A15EP  - A16,638543377,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2016-EPHPabstracts.20,,#651,Scott 2016,"",""
Sickle cell disease patient perspectives on health care experiences and improvements for the future: A mixed methods approach,Heinert S.; ; Colla J.; Hughes T.; Hsu L.,"Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is characterized by unbearable, life-altering pain episodes that can result in frequent utilization of the ED. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to use a mixed methods approach to learn about ED practices and attitudes by SCD patients in relation to their health care, and gather further details on some themes already found in qualitative research with SCD patients, such as an individualized pain treatment plan. <ovid:br/>Method(s): One focus group of eight participants (seven people with SCD and one parent of a child with SCD) was conducted at the conclusion of a local sickle cell conference in a suburb of Chicago in February 2014. Participation was voluntary and participants received a small gift card for their time. At the start of the 90 minute focus group, participants completed a short, written questionnaire in order to gather demographics and information about experiences related to care for SCD. The discussion was audio recorded and analyzed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Average age of focus group participants was 41.7 (SD=12.8) years and 87.5% had completed at least some college. Six participants (75%) were female. Of people with SCD (either participant or child of parent participant), 6 (75%) had health insurance and 6 (75%) had a primary care provider (PCP). One participant (13%) has 12 or more ED visits in an average year, and 25% of participants did not have regular checkups for their SCD. Themes of the discussion included receiving better SCD care as a child than as an adult, and a need for more rapid initial pain treatment. Participants reported a stigma of being a drug seeker, lack of trust by providers, and lack of SCD knowledge by providers. Additionally, participants cited variation in care by different providers in the ED and were interested in a personalized pain plan that could provide more consistent care. They stressed that this plan would need to be ""locked"" or unchangeable by patients so that providers do not question its legitimacy, as well as portable, in case patients are travelling or otherwise cannot reach their regular hospital at the time of a pain crisis. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These findings suggest opportunities for better care for SCD patients in the emergency setting. Increased SCD education and training of providers, increased time to pain treatment, and a personalized care plan may help achieve improved care for these patients.",2015,/,Academic Emergency Medicine,22,5 SUPPL. 1,S403EP  - S404,71879566,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acem.12644,,#653,Heinert 2015,"",""
"""It's Pedagogical and It's Selfish"": How Classroom Policies Promote Inclusive Pedagogy, Student Success, and Faculty Legitimacy","Whitehead, Ellen M; Holtzman, Mellisa","Course policies around attendance and submission deadlines have documented impacts on student outcomes within college courses, yet our understanding remains limited of instructors' own motivations behind the policies they adopt. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 43 college instructors, we find that faculty emphasize both student-centered and instructor-focused considerations. Pedagogically, they create policies they believe will enhance student success, promote equity and inclusion, and enable students to account for the realities of life. But they also design policies they believe will make their job easier, positively impact students' perceptions of them, and align with gender role and tenure expectations. These findings have implications for faculty development and university efforts to support student success.",2024,,International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,18,1,,3075715094; EJ1428703,,,#696,Whitehead 2024,"",""
Beliefs about Parental Authority Legitimacy among Refugee Youth in Jordan: Between- and Within-Person Variations,"Smetana, Judith G.; Ahmad, Ikhlas; Wray-Lake, Laura","We examined within- and between-person variations in parental legitimacy beliefs in a sample of 883 Arab refugee youth (M[subscript age] = 15.01 years, SD = 1.60), 277 Iraqis, 275 Syrians, and 331 Palestinians, in Amman, Jordan. Latent profile analyses of 22 belief items yielded 4 profiles of youth. The ""normative"" profile (67% of the sample, n = 585) most strongly endorsed parental authority legitimacy for prudential (risky) items, followed by moral, conventional, and then friendship items, with legitimacy lowest for personal items. The ""low-normative"" profile (10%, n = 85) followed a similar pattern, although legitimacy ratings were significantly lower than ""normative"" youth for most items, but not the personal ones. ""Rebellious"" youth (11%, n = 96) held deviant peer values; they endorsed less legitimacy, particularly for prudential and friendship items, than did youth in other profiles. ""Mixed"" youth (12%, n = 101) were similar to ""rebellious"" youth in some judgments and ""low-normative"" youth in others. Profile membership did not differ by adolescents' age or parental socioeconomic status but did differ by gender and national background. Youth fitting the ""normative"" (and to some extent, the ""low-normative"") profile rated parents higher in support, behavioral control, and knowledge of adolescents' activities and lower in psychological control-disrespect and harsh punishment than did ""rebellious"" or ""mixed"" youth. ""Normative"" (and also, but less consistently, ""low-normative"") youth reported better psychosocial adjustment across multiple measures than did ""rebellious"" and ""mixed"" youth.",2016,,Developmental Psychology,52,3,484-495,1826519480; EJ1091398,https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000084,,#697,Smetana 2016,"",""
The Threat of Sexism in a STEM Educational Setting: The Moderating Impacts of Ethnicity and Legitimacy Beliefs on Test Performance,"O'Brien, Laurie T.; Garcia, Donna M.; Adams, Glenn; Villalobos, J. Guillermo; Hammer, Elliott; Gilbert, Patricia","Social identity threat has negative consequences for women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The present study examined whether legitimacy beliefs--beliefs that status differences between men and women in STEM fields are fair--put women at risk for experiencing social identity threat and poorer performance on a difficult logic test. Legitimacy beliefs served as a risk factor for both women from ethnic groups that are overrepresented in STEM (e.g., Asian Americans and European Americans) and from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM (African Americans and Latina Americans), albeit under different conditions. Among women from overrepresented ethnic groups, legitimacy beliefs were negatively related to test performance when explicit cues to sexism were present. However, among women from underrepresented ethnic groups, legitimacy beliefs were negatively related to test performance when explicit cues to sexism were absent. The present research points to the need for inclusion of ethnic diversity in studies of women in STEM.",2015,,Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal,18,4,667-684,1773218906; EJ1082935,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11218-015-9310-1,,#698,O'Brien 2015,"",""
Latina Faculty in the Labyrinth: Constructing and Contesting Legitimacy in Hispanic Serving Institutions,"Gonzales, Leslie D.; Murakami, Elizabeth; Nunez, Anne-Marie","This article focuses on the presence and experiences of Latina academics in the U.S., especially those who serve in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).
