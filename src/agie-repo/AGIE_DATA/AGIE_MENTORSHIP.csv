"Controlling Behavior, Sex Bias and Coaching Success in Japanese Track and Field.",Tsukahara Y; Kamada H; Torii S; Yamasawa F; Macznik AK,"Coaching athletes is a complex and lengthy process. Recently, attention has been given to coaches over-controlling behavior toward the athletes' personal lives and possible sex bias, but the impact of these behaviors on coaching success is unclear. An anonymous survey was answered by 412 track and field coaches (male: 369; female: 43), comprising questions regarding controlling behaviors, sex bias, and personal background. A Chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine the factors related to the coach's characteristics and their success in coaching athletes (to national vs. non-national level). The results showed that controlling behaviors and sex-bias-related beliefs were present. The coaches who coached national-level athletes were more likely to be older, more experienced, and were national level athletes themselves. More national-level coaches reported controlling behaviors but fewer held sex bias beliefs than the non-national level coaches. However, the strength of these beliefs (scores for controlling behavior and sex bias) was not related to the coaching success.",2023,Jan,Sports (Basel),11,2,,,10.3390/sports11020032,36828317,#8,Tsukahara 2023,"",""

Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. METHODS: A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. RESULTS: Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001). Despite no gender differences, one-third of respondents reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their ability to mentor and be mentored.

Suturing the gender gap through sponsorship: The role of sponsorship in female entry and advancement through their surgical careers.,Mahendran GN; Walker ER; Bennett M; Chen AY,"BACKGROUND: Sponsorship promotes female entry and advancement through the surgical field, and can mitigate gender inequities that persist in the surgical field. METHODS: 35 women in surgery, including 14 surgeons, 11 residents, and 10 fourth-year medical students, were interviewed from July 30, 2021 to August 18, 2021 at a single institution. RESULTS: All participants had provided or received sponsorship. Main themes included: (1) Evolving needs of sponsorship, (2) Decreased Access to Sponsorship as Career Level Advances, (3) Evolving importance of sponsorship, (4) Perceived limitations of receiving sponsorship, and (5) Perceived limitations of providing sponsorship. Faculty members most frequently reported barriers to both receiving and providing sponsorship. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of sponsorship for female faculty limits their ability to rise to organizational leadership, and consequently, their ability to sponsor others. Increasing access to sponsorship for female surgeons can help to bridge the gender gap in the surgical field.",2022,Jul,Am J Surg,224,1 Pt B,266-270,,10.1016/j.amjsurg.2022.02.008,35164958,#15,Mahendran 2022,"",""
Mentoring Relationships and Gender Inequities in Academic Medicine: Findings From a Multi-Institutional Qualitative Study.,Murphy M; Record H; Callander JK; Dohan D; Grandis JR,"PURPOSE: This study examined how mentoring relationships may reinforce or mitigate gender inequities in academic medicine. METHOD: In-depth, semistructured interviews with medical school faculty members (52 women and 52 men) were conducted at 16 institutions across the United States in 2019. Institutions were recruited using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity in geography, ownership (private or public), and prestige. Within institutions, purposive sampling was used to recruit equal numbers of women and men and to seek diversity in degree type (MD, PhD), age, and career stage. A coding scheme was developed through iterative analysis of the interview transcripts. All interview transcripts were then coded with the goal of identifying intersections between mentorship and experiences of and responses to gender inequities. RESULTS: Four key themes at the intersection of mentoring relationships and gender inequities were identified. (1) Both women and men became aware of gender inequities in academic medicine through relationships with women mentors and mentees. (2) Both women and men mentors recognized the challenges their female mentees faced and made deliberate efforts to help them navigate an inequitable environment. (3) Both women and men mentors modeled work-family balance and created family friendly environments for their mentees. (4) Some women, but no men, reported being sexually harassed by mentors. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities are acknowledged and mitigated. It also shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities, such as sexual harassment, may occur. Sexual harassment in academic medicine has been widely documented, and gender inequity in academic medicine has proved persistent. While mentoring relationships may have the potential to identify and mitigate gender inequities, this study suggests that this potential remains largely unrealized.",2022,Jan,Acad Med,97,1,136-142,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004388,34495884,#16,Murphy 2022,"",""

"Gender Discrimination, Career Aspirations, and Access to Mentorship Among Medical Students in Brazil.",Gerk A; Campos L; Naus A; Faria I; Buda AM; Moura CB; Graner M; Cazumbá ML; Jean Pierre TA; Pompermaier L; Truche P; Pendleton A; Bowder AN; Ferreira JL,"INTRODUCTION: Gender-based discrimination (GBD) creates a hostile environment that can affect medical students. Mentorship has been recognized as a mitigating factor for GBD. We aimed to investigate the impacts of GBD on career selection and well-being of medical students in Brazil and to explore access to mentorship among these students. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using an anonymous survey in Portuguese. The survey was distributed in June 2021 to students enrolled in Brazilian medical schools. It contained 24 questions, including demographics, episodes of GBD experienced by responders and their impact on professional and personal life, and mentorship access. RESULTS: Of 953 respondents, 748 (78%) were cisgender women, 194 (20%) cisgender men, and 11 nonbinary (1%). Sixty-six percent (625/953) of students reported experiencing GBD, with cisgender women and nonbinary being more likely to experience it than cisgender men (P < 0.001). Responders who experiences GBD report moderate to severe impact on career satisfaction (40%, 250/624), safety (68%, 427/624), self-confidence (68%, 426/624), well-being (57%, 357/625), and burnout (62%, 389/625). Cisgender women were more likely to report these effects than men counterparts (P < 0.01). Only 21% of respondents (201/953) had mentors in their medical schools. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that GBD is widespread among Brazilian medical students affecting their personal and professional lives, and most of them do not have access to a mentor. There is an urgent need to increase access to mentors who could mitigate the adverse effects of GBD and help develop a diverse and inclusive medical workforce.",2022,Nov,J Surg Res,279,,702-711,,10.1016/j.jss.2022.06.064,35940048,#18,Gerk 2022,"",""

Checking gender bias: Parents and mentors perceive less chess potential in girls.,Arnold SH; Bailey AH; Ma WJ; Shahade J; Cimpian A,"Girls and women are underrepresented in chess. Here, we explored the role of gender bias in this phenomenon. Specifically, we investigated whether parents and mentors (e.g., coaches) show bias against the female youth players in their lives. Parents and mentors (N = 286; 90.6% men) recruited through the U.S. Chess Federation reported their evaluations of and investment in youth players (N = 654). We found evidence of bias on some, but not all, measures. Most strikingly, parents and mentors thought that female youth players' highest potential chess ratings were on average lower than male players', a bias that was exacerbated among parents and mentors who believed that success in chess requires brilliance. In addition, mentors who endorsed (vs. rejected) this belief also reported that female mentees were more likely to drop out of chess due to low ability. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence of bias against youth female players and hold implications for the role of parents and mentors in other domains that, like chess, are culturally associated with intellectual ability and exhibit substantial gender imbalances (e.g., science and technology).

Race and Gender Differences in Undergraduate Research Mentoring Structures and Research Outcomes.,Aikens ML; Robertson MM; Sadselia S; Watkins K; Evans M; Runyon CR; Eby LT; Dolan EL,"Participating in undergraduate research with mentorship from faculty may be particularly important for ensuring the persistence of women and minority students in science. Yet many life science undergraduates at research universities are mentored by graduate or postdoctoral researchers (i.e., postgraduates). We surveyed a national sample of undergraduate life science researchers about the mentoring structure of their research experiences and the outcomes they realized from participating in research. We observed two common mentoring structures: an open triad with undergraduate-postgraduate and postgraduate-faculty ties but no undergraduate-faculty tie, and a closed triad with ties among all three members. We found that men and underrepresented minority (URM) students are significantly more likely to report a direct tie to their faculty mentors (closed triad) than women, white, and Asian students. We also determined that mentoring structure was associated with differences in student outcomes. Women's mentoring structures were associated with their lower scientific identity, lower intentions to pursue a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) PhD, and lower scholarly productivity. URM students' mentoring structures were associated with higher scientific identity, greater intentions to pursue a STEM PhD, and higher scholarly productivity. Asian students reported lower scientific identity and intentions to pursue a STEM PhD, which were unrelated to their mentoring structures.",2017,Summer,CBE Life Sci Educ,16,2,,,10.1187/cbe.16-07-0211,28550078,#23,Aikens 2017,"",""
Gender bias in academic medicine: a resumé study.,Burke E; Heron EA; Hennessy M,"BACKGROUND: Minimising the effects of unconscious bias in selection for clinical academic training is essential to ensure that allocation of training posts is based on merit. We looked at the effect of anonymising applications to a training programme for junior doctors on the scores of the applications and on gender balance; and whether female candidates were more likely to seek gender-concordant mentors. METHODS: Applications to the training programme were reviewed and scored independently by reviewers who received either an anonymised or named copy. Scores were compared using a paired t-test, and differences in scores compared by gender. The gender of named supervisors for male and female candidates was compared. RESULTS: Scores of 101 applications were reviewed. When their identity was known, male candidates scored 1.72% higher and female candidates scored 0.74% higher, but these findings were not statistically significant (p value = 0.279 and 0.579). Following introduction of anonymisation, the proportion of successful female candidates increased from 27 to 46%. Female candidates were more likely to name a female supervisor compared to male (41% vs. 25% of supervisors). CONCLUSIONS: Anonymising applications did not significantly change scores, although gender balance improved. Gender-concordant mentoring initiatives should consider effects on mentors as well as mentees.",2023,May,BMC Med Educ,23,1,291,,10.1186/s12909-023-04192-6,37127591,#24,Burke 2023,"",""
Exploring Gaps in Concussion Knowledge and Knowledge Translation Among Coaches of Youth Female Hockey.,Guo D; Verweel L; Reed N,"OBJECTIVE: To better understand the level of concussion knowledge of youth female hockey coaches and to identify preferred methods of knowledge translation for this population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Participants independently completed written surveys before in-person concussion information sessions or online surveys through link provided in emails. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sampling yielded 130 coaches of youth female hockey from Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge level on concussion, resources from which coaches obtained information on concussion, opinions on the current level of concussion knowledge, and knowledge translation. RESULTS: Coaches demonstrated adequate knowledge on concussion, achieving 84% correct on true-false questions and 92% correct on symptom identification accuracy. However, coaches showed limited awareness of concussion specific to mechanisms for injury (identification) and postconcussion symptoms. Internet resources were rated as the most used resources for concussion yet were not rated very helpful. Nonetheless, coaches indicated online courses and web sites as the most preferred method for concussion knowledge translation. CONCLUSIONS: Youth female hockey coaches have overall adequate knowledge of concussion; however, gaps in knowledge do exist. Future efforts to raise the concussion knowledge among coaches of female youth hockey should include information specific to the mechanism of injury, along with sign and symptom identification, with particular attention paid to emotional symptoms.

Closing the Mentorship Gap: Implementation of Speed Mentoring Events for Women Faculty and Trainees in Anesthesiology.,Pollard EM; Sharpe EE; Gali B; Moeschler SM,"Introduction: Mentorship is a key component to success in academic medicine. Women are under-represented in leadership positions within medicine. Women are less likely to identify mentors than men. Speed mentoring is an innovative strategy to facilitate mentorship in academic medicine. Materials and Methods: A speed mentoring event for women faculty members in an academic anesthesiology department was held, followed by a second event for trainees. Attendees completed surveys about mentorship experiences at baseline and in follow-up. Questions were rated on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree with values reported as median (1st, 3rd quartile). Results: Baseline surveys indicated poor satisfaction with mentoring in the prior 6 months as 4.5 (3, 5.25). Twelve months later, mentees reported increased satisfaction with mentoring 6 (6, 6). Mentors and mentees felt their time was well spent during both events. There was an increase in the number of mentors identified after the events by both groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest speed mentoring is well received and impactful with minimal time and monetary investment. The attendees of the events identified an increased number of mentors after speed mentoring events, and this effect was maintained at 6-12 months. Speed mentoring may be one path to providing support for women to advance their careers in academic medicine. More research is warranted to better evaluate effectiveness of formats such as speed mentoring to facilitate improved mentorship for women in academic anesthesiology.",2021,,Womens Health Rep (New Rochelle),2,1,32-36,,10.1089/whr.2020.0095,33786528,#26,Pollard 2021,"",""
Perceptions of Gender Disparities Among Women in Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology.,Methangkool E; Brodt J; Kolarczyk L; Ivascu NS; Hicks MH; Herrera E; Oakes D,"OBJECTIVE: In this study of women in cardiothoracic anesthesiology, the authors aimed to characterize demographics, roles in leadership, and perceived professional challenges. DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional survey of female cardiothoracic anesthesiologists in the United States. SETTING: An internet-based survey of 43 questions was sent to women in cardiothoracic anesthesiology. The survey included questions on demographics, leadership, and perceptions of professional challenges including career advancement, compensation, promotion, harassment, and intimidation. PARTICIPANTS: A database of women in cardiothoracic anesthesiology was created via personal contacts and snowball sampling. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 153 responses were analyzed, for a response rate of 65.1%. Most respondents were at the Clinical Instructor or Assistant Professor rank. Many women perceived that compensation, promotion, authorship, and career advancement were affected by gender. Furthermore, 67% of respondents identified having children as having a negative impact on career advancement. Many women reported experiencing derogatory comments (55.6%), intimidation (57.8%), microaggression (69.6%), sexual harassment (25.2%), verbal harassment (45.2%), and unwanted physical or sexual advances (24.4%). These behaviors were most often from a surgical attending, anesthesia attending, or patient.

The gender gap in European neurosurgical conference presentations.,Woodfield J; Copley PC; Hughes M; Edlmann E,"OBJECTIVE: Within neurosurgery, there are fewer women than men at all levels. The authors aimed to assess whether opportunities and representation within neurosurgery are proportional to the existing gender gap. METHODS: The authors analyzed the program of the 2019 joint European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS)/Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS) conference to assess the proportions of presentations given through abstract submission and invitation by men and women. They compared proportions to the previous joint conference in 2007 and to the gender proportions of board-certified European neurosurgeons. RESULTS: Women delivered 75/577 (13%) presentations at the 2019 EANS/SBNS conference: 54/283 (19%) abstract submissions and 21/294 (7%) invited presentations. Fifteen of 152 (10%) session chairs were women. This increased significantly from 4/121 (3%) presentations delivered by women in 2007. When only presentations given by neurosurgeons (residents or consultants) were analyzed, the proportion of female speakers increased from 1/111 (1%) in 2007 to 60/545 (11%) in 2019. Pediatrics was the subspecialty with the highest proportion of invited female speakers. Across subspecialties, there were no differences in gender proportions for presentations from abstract submissions. Across the top 5 participating European countries, the proportion of female invited speakers (8%) and chairs (8%) was half the proportion of female board-certified neurosurgeons (16%). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of women delivering invited presentations and chairing sessions at a European neurosurgical conference is lower than expected from the available pool of board-certified neurosurgeons. The proportion of women participating is higher through application (abstract submission) than through invitation. The higher proportion of presentations from abstract submission may reflect submission from a pool of trainees with a higher proportion of women.

Beyond stereotypes: The role of exposure in reshaping Children's biases towards women as coaches in sports.,Sambol S; Dadswell K; Hanlon C,"The underrepresentation of women in sports coaching, linked to discrimination and bias may, according to contact theory, be mitigated by increasing the visibility of women coaches, especially among children. Our study examined whether young athletes exposed to women coaches affected their explicit and implicit biases compared to unexposed peers. Seventy-five children aged between 4 and 17 years were evaluated using two explicit attitude measures and an Implicit Association Task. Results indicated that participants with women coach experience were more explicitly satisfied with woman coaches, preferred them more as potential coaches, and associated men with sports less than those without such exposure. Whilst exposure and implicit bias significantly predicted explicit satisfaction, exposure did not moderate the bias relationship. This suggests that exposure to women coaches reduces negative attitudes in young athletes but does not significantly affect the underlying influence of implicit biases, indicating a need for more comprehensive strategies to address gender inequalities in sports coaching.",2024,Jul,Psychol Sport Exerc,73,,102634,,10.1016/j.psychsport.2024.102634,38554927,#31,Sambol 2024,"",""
Kinematic Differences Based on Shooting Proficiency and Distance in Female Basketball Players.,Cabarkapa D; Cabarkapa DV; Philipp NM; Myers CA; Whiting SM; Jones GT; Fry AC,"The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in kinematic characteristics between (a) proficient and non-proficient two-point and three-point shooters, (b) made and missed two-point and three-point shots within a proficient group of shooters, and (c) shots attempted from two-point and three-point shooting distances. Eighteen recreationally active females with previous basketball playing experience attempted 10 two-point (5.10 m) and 10 three-point shots (6.32 m) while facing directly to the basket. To eliminate the possible influence of fatigue, each shot was separated by a 5-10 s rest interval. Participants who made ≥50% of their two-point and ≥40% of their three-point shooting attempts were classified as proficient. A high-definition video camera recording at 30 fps and video analysis software (Kinovea) were used to obtain the kinematic variables of interest during both the preparatory phase (PP) and release phase (RP) of the shooting motion. The results indicate that proficient two-point shooters attained less hip and shoulder flexion during the PP and had greater release height and vertical displacement during the RP. Hip angle differentiated made from missed two-point shots within the proficient group of shooters, with made shots being depicted by less hip flexion. Significantly greater vertical displacement was observed in proficient three-point shooters during the RP. Additionally, the greater elbow and release angles separated made from missed three-point shots within the proficient group of shooters. In response to an increase in shooting distance, hip, knee, ankle, and shoulder angles during the PP all decreased. Moreover, an increase in shooting distance caused a decrease in release angle and an increase in vertical displacement during the RP, while the relative release height remained unchanged.",2023,Sep,J Funct Morphol Kinesiol,8,3,,,10.3390/jfmk8030129,37754961,#32,Cabarkapa 2023,"",""

Gender Differences in the Relationships Between Coach Transformational Leadership and Player Satisfaction and Commitment: A Meta-Analytic Review.,Kim HD; Cruz AB,"This study meta-analyzed the relationships between coach transformational leadership and player satisfaction and commitment. We also examined the potential moderating effect of player gender on these relationships. In total, 182 effect sizes were obtained from 26 studies comprised of 6,715 participants. The analyses revealed that the overall direct effect of transformational leadership was moderate on both athletic satisfaction and exercise commitment. The effect of charismatic construct of transformational leadership was moderate on athletic satisfaction as well as exercise commitment. Finally, player gender was found to moderate the effects of the relationship between transformational leadership and athletic satisfaction and exercise commitment of players. Specifically, female players' satisfaction and commitment were more positively affected by transformational leadership compared with their male counterparts. Our findings suggests that effective leadership in sports is dependent on the interaction among leadership behaviors of the coach, personal characteristics of the players, and situational factors and highlights the importance of transformational leadership as an important requirement for creating a more positive and sustainable sports environment.",2022,,Front Psychol,13,,915391,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.915391,35800950,#34,Kim 2022,"",""
Gender Bias in Surgical Oncology Fellowship Recommendation Letters: Gaining Progress.,Grova MM; Jenkins FG; Filippou P; Strassle PD; Jin Kim H; Ollila DW; Meyers MO,"OBJECTIVE: Gender bias has been identified in letters of recommendation (LOR) in many different surgical training fields. Among surgeons, women comprise over 30% of the full-time faculty positions nationally and surgical oncology is one of the most gender diverse surgical subspecialties. We sought to determine if bias existed in LOR submitted to a Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowship. DESIGN: LOR for the CGSO fellowship were retrospectively analyzed from applicants at a single institution over an 8-year period (2013-2020). The linguistic content of the letters was analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015), a validated text analysis program. Using multivariable analysis, LOR were compared by gender of both applicant and letter writer to explore the association between gender and the characteristics of the applicants and letter writers. SETTING: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), Division of Surgical Oncology and Endocrine Surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Applicants interviewed for the CSGO fellowship program at the UNC from 2013 to 2020 as well as all applicants from the 2018 application cycle, regardless of interview status. RESULTS: About 841 letters from 219 interviewed applicants throughout the 2013 to 2020 surgical oncology fellowship application cycles were included. No difference in authenticity, clout, analytic thinking, or emotional tone of the letters was seen when comparing men and women applicants. Of the 41 word categories analyzed, only ""references to achievement"" in LOR written for women was significantly higher when compared to LOR written for men (p = 0.01). Interestingly, significantly more women applicants had at least 1 LOR written by a woman (p = 0.04). A subset analysis of all applicants regardless of interview status from the 2018 cycle included 294 LOR from 77 applicants. With the inclusion of noninterviewed applicants, LOR for men had more analytic tone than LOR for women (p = 0.02), otherwise there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Very few differences in LOR were found for applicants at a CGSO fellowship program based on applicant or letter writer gender.

Gender Disparities and Their Impact on the Professional Experiences of Female Neurosurgery Residents in Germany: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,Omer M; Nguyen TL; Alhamdan AA; Machetanz K; Nistor-Gallo D; Moritz I; Ramirez TR; Kim DB; Lawson McLean AC; Maurer S; Posti JP,"BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in gender equality within neurosurgery, the field continues to encounter challenges related to the under-representation of women and reports of gender-based disparities. This study examines the impact of these disparities on the experiences, professional development, and well-being of female neurosurgery residents in Germany, identifying specific challenges within the neurosurgical community. METHODS: An anonymous, questionnaire-based survey was conducted among female neurosurgery residents from various German training hospitals nationwide, using a quantitative approach. Data were collected from June 2021 to January 2023. RESULTS: A total of 63 female neurosurgery residents participated, representing about 19% of all female neurosurgery residents in Germany. Seventy percent reported experiencing incidents of discrimination during training, with 39% encountering ""sometimes"" emotional abuse, 20% physical abuse, and 17% ""rarely"" experiencing sexual harassment. Eighty-six percent did not report these incidents, primarily due to doubts about reporting effectiveness (24%) and the belief that reporting would not lead to change (24%). Discrimination significantly impacted job satisfaction (56%) and career progression (71%). Additionally, 60% reported frequent frustration, 52% experienced occasional depression, and burnout was common. CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlights gender disparities affecting female neurosurgery residents in Germany, negatively influencing job satisfaction and career advancement.

METHODS: A survey of basic demographic information and a Likert-based questionnaire addressing various factors in specialty choice was sent to all military medical students in the class of 2019. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 30%. Amongst the students that completed the survey, 72% were male and 28% were female. The majority of students were less than 27 years old (52%) and Caucasian (76%). Female medical students placed more importance in exposure to third year clerkships (P = 0.004) and gender diversity within the specialty (P = 0.03) than their male counterparts. There was no statistical difference in opinions of significant others or family members, desire to have a family, or having a well-balanced life between female, and male medical students.

Mentoring as an intervention to promote gender equality in academic medicine: a systematic review.,House A; Dracup N; Burkinshaw P; Ward V; Bryant LD,"BACKGROUND: Mentoring is frequently suggested as an intervention to address gender inequalities in the workplace. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review evidence published since a definitive review in 2006 on the effectiveness of mentoring interventions aimed at achieving gender equality in academic medicine. DESIGN: Systematic Review, using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication as a template for data extraction and synthesis. SAMPLE: Studies were included if they described a specific mentoring intervention in a medical school or analogous academic healthcare organisation and included results from an evaluation of the intervention. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Mentoring was defined as (1) a formally organised intervention entailing a supportive relationship between a mentor, defined as a more senior/experienced person and a mentee defined as a more junior/inexperienced person; (2) mentoring intervention involved academic career support (3) the mentoring relationship was outside line management or supervision of performance and was defined by contact over an extended period of time. OUTCOMES: The impact of mentoring was usually reported at the level of individual participants, for example, satisfaction and well-being or self-reported career progression. We sought evidence of impact on gender equality via reports of organisation-level effectiveness, of promotion or retention, pay and academic performance of female staff. RESULTS: We identified 32 publications: 8 review articles, 20 primary observational studies and 4 randomised controlled trials.

Comprehensive evidence examining whether sex differences in faculty rank exist in academic cardiology, adjusting for experience and research productivity, is lacking. Therefore, we evaluated for sex differences in faculty rank among a comprehensive, contemporary cohort of US cardiologists after adjustment for several factors that impact academic advancement, including measures of clinical experience and research productivity. METHODS: We identified all US cardiologists with medical school faculty appointments in 2014 by using the American Association of Medical Colleges faculty roster and linked this list to a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, a professional networking website for doctors. Data on physician age, sex, years since residency, cardiology subspecialty, publications, National Institutes of Health grants, and registered clinical trials were available for all academic cardiologists. We estimated sex differences in full professorship, adjusting for these factors and medical school-specific fixed effects in a multivariable regression model. RESULTS: Among 3810 cardiologists with faculty appointments in 2014 (13.3% of all US cardiologists), 630 (16.5%) were women. Women faculty were younger than men (mean age, 48.3 years versus 53.5 years, P<0.001), had fewer total publications (mean number: 16.5 publications versus 25.2 publications; P<0.001), were similarly likely to have National Institutes of Health funding (proportion with at least 1 National Institutes of Health award, 10.8% versus 10.4%; P=0.77), and were less likely to have a registered clinical trial (percentage with at least 1 clinical trial, 8.9% versus 11.1%; P=0.10).

Tackling Gender and Racial Bias in Academic Emergency Medicine: The Perceived Role of Implicit Bias in Faculty Development.,Cleveland Manchanda EC; Macias-Konstantopoulos WL,"Background Gender and racial disparities in academic medicine have recently garnered much attention. Implicit Association Tests (IATs) offer a validated means of evaluating unconscious associations and preferences. This study examines the perceived role of implicit bias in faculty development in academic emergency medicine (EM). Methods EM faculty at a large urban academic medical center were invited to independently participate in a self-reflection assessment in preparation for a faculty retreat session discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants completed two IATs designed to examine gender associations (gender IAT) and race preferences (race IAT) followed by a short anonymous survey where IAT scores were recorded. The survey also captured demographic information and perceptions about the impact of gender and racial biases in faculty development. Results Forty faculty members (66%) completed the survey; 70% were male and 80% white. The majority (59%) reported gender IAT results indicating automatic male-sciences and female-liberal arts associations. Nearly half (45%) reported race IAT results indicating an automatic preference for white people. More than 70% of males reported that faculty recruitment, development, and promotion decisions were 'never' or 'seldom' affected by gender bias, while more than 80% reported racial bias 'never' or 'seldom' affects these decisions. Female faculty more frequently perceived adverse effects of unconscious gender and race biases. Conclusion Our group of academic physicians reported IAT results showing different levels of implicit bias compared to the general population. Female faculty may be both more aware of and more susceptible to the adverse effects of unconscious biases. Further study is needed to determine both the extent to which unconscious biases affect the academic workplace, as well as ways in which such unintentional forms of discrimination can be eliminated. Unconscious biases are not unique to EM. Intentional efforts to increase self-awareness of these 'blind spots' may help mitigate their impact and foster a more diverse and inclusive healthcare environment.",2020,Nov,Cureus,12,11,e11325,,10.7759/cureus.11325,33282598,#51,ClevelandManchanda 2020,"",""
"Gender equity in sport from the perspective of European women athletes and sport managers, physical education teachers and sport coaches.",Vaquero-Cristóbal R; Mateo-Orcajada A; Dağlı Ekmekçi YA; Pereira A; Amin S; Meroño L; González-Gálvez N; Ballı ÖM; Mendes F; Mbah O; Abenza-Cano L; Leiva-Arcas A; Doğan Yİ; Figueiredo A; Ponce-Ramírez CM; Esparza-Ros F; Albaladejo-Saura M,"INTRODUCTION: For years, gender inequality has conditioned women's participation in sport, exposing them to difficult situations and numerous barriers to face. However, no previous research has analyzed the situation of women in sport from the perspective of the athletes themselves, or from the perspective of the coaches, teachers or managers who work with them. METHODS: This study examines the perspectives of European women athletes, sports managers, physical education teachers, and sports coaches, on gender equity in sports across six European countries: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. The research design was consistent with a critical realist epistemology, and the sampling method was non-probabilistic by convenience. A total of 42 female athletes (mean age: 24.37 ± 8.27 years old; mean sport experience: 6.67 ± 7.76 years) and 45 sports managers, physical education teachers or coaches (mean age: 47.00 ± 11.99 years old; mean sport experience: 9.62 ± 10.60 years), participated in six focus groups in the same countries, in groups of 6 to 10 participants per focus group. Focus groups were conducted to stimulate collective discussions, build upon and question ideas, and reach a consensus on questions drawn up by a group of experts, following previous methodologies. The data analysis involved transcribing, translating, and contextualizing the focus group recordings into English. Inductive thematic analysis, reflexive thematic analysis, and codes and themes within the data were created using NVivo 12 Pro. RESULTS: The main topics discussed by the female athletes were ""gender inequality in general and in sport,"" ""barriers to gender equity,"" ""reasons for abandonment,"" ""needs,"" ""environment role models"" and ""tools for the gender equity in sport."" The main topics discussed by the sports managers, physical education teachers, and coaches were ""gender inequality in general,"" ""gender inequality in sports,"" ""tools"" and ""reasons, motives, drivers."" The results of the study revealed that gender inequality in sports is influenced by a broader social context, where stereotypes, biases, and discrimination persist. The participants also highlighted the challenges, barriers, and needs that women athletes face in their careers, such as a lack of resources, support, visibility, and recognition. Moreover, the participants suggested some strategies to promote gender equity in sports, such as increasing investment, awareness, and education, creating policies and legislation, fostering women's leadership and role modeling, and developing mixed and inclusive sports projects. DISCUSSION: According to athletes and sports managers/teachers/coaches, gender inequality is still present in sport. There are barriers and challenges that need to be addressed such as lack of resources, visibility, and recognition for female athletes. Among the strategies that can be used to reverse this situation are increasing investment, awareness, and education, creating policies and legislation, fostering women's leadership, and developing mixed and inclusive sport projects.",2024,,Front Psychol,15,,1419578,,10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1419578,39184942,#52,Vaquero-Cristóbal 2024,"",""
Gender discrepancy in research activities during radiology residency.,Vernuccio F; Arzanauskaite M; Turk S; Torres ET; Choa JMD; Udare AS; Haroun D; Serra MM; Shelmerdine S; Bold B; Bae JS; Romero EE; Vilgrain V,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of gender disparity in academic involvement during radiology residency and to identify and characterize any gender differences in perceived barriers for conducting research. METHODS: An international call for participation in an online survey was promoted via social media and through multiple international and national radiological societies. A 35-question survey invited radiology trainees worldwide to answer questions regarding exposure and barriers to academic radiology during their training. Gender differences in response proportions were analyzed using either Fisher's exact or chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifty-eight participants (438 men, 420 women) from Europe (432), Asia (241), North and South America (144), Africa (37), and Oceania (4) completed the survey. Fewer women radiology residents were involved in research during residency (44.3%, 186/420 vs 59.4%, 260/438; p ≤ 0.0001) and had fewer published original articles (27.9%, 117/420 vs. 40.2%, 176/438; p = 0.001). Women were more likely to declare gender as a barrier to research (24.3%, 102/420 vs. 6.8%, 30/438; p < 0.0001) and lacked mentorship/support from faculty (65%, 273/420 vs. 55.7%, 244/438; p = 0.0055). Men were more likely to declare a lack of time (60.3%, 264/438 vs. 50.7%, 213/420; p = 0.0049) and lack of personal interest (21%, 92/438 vs. 13.6%, 57/420, p = 0.0041) in conducting research. CONCLUSION: Fewer women were involved in academic activities during radiology residency, resulting in fewer original published studies compared to their men counterparts.

"Mentoring perception, scientific collaboration and research performance: is there a 'gender gap' in academic medicine? An Academic Health Science Centre perspective.",Athanasiou T; Patel V; Garas G; Ashrafian H; Hull L; Sevdalis N; Harding S; Darzi A; Paroutis S,"OBJECTIVES: The 'gender gap' in academic medicine remains significant and predominantly favours males. This study investigates gender disparities in research performance in an Academic Health Science Centre, while considering factors such as mentoring and scientific collaboration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Professorial registry-based electronic survey (n=215) using bibliometric data, a mentoring perception survey and social network analysis. Survey outcomes were aggregated with measures of research performance (publications, citations and h-index) and measures of scientific collaboration (authorship position, centrality and social capital). Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed to evaluate inter-relationships and identify gender differences. RESULTS: One hundred and four professors responded (48% response rate). Males had a significantly higher number of previous publications than females (mean 131.07 (111.13) vs 79.60 (66.52), p=0.049). The distribution of mentoring survey scores between males and females was similar for the quality and frequency of shared core, mentor-specific and mentee-specific skills. In multivariate analysis including gender as a variable, the quality of managing the relationship, frequency of providing corrective feedback and frequency of building trust had a statistically significant positive influence on number of publications (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in healthcare research to investigate the relationship between mentoring perception, scientific collaboration and research performance in the context of gender.

Social capital as a catalyst for gender inequality: A scoping review of networking disparities in academic medicine.,Callander JK; Johnson DE; Grandis JR,"Gender disparities in academic medicine persist despite gender parity among medical school graduates. Women remain underrepresented in higher academic ranks and leadership roles, with significant differences in retention, promotion, and compensation. In this scoping review, the authors explore the role of networking and social capital in exacerbating these disparities. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of networking in obtaining leadership roles, decreasing social isolation, and enhancing retention. Sponsorship, distinct from mentorship, is vital for career development and has a direct impact on professional growth. However, women are often under-sponsored compared with men, limiting their access to influential networks. In addition, virtual networking platforms and women-focused organizations offer promising alternatives to traditional, male-dominated networking activities. Despite the progress made, informal networking practices and gender biases continue to exclude women from key opportunities. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at enhancing the social capital of women in academic medicine to help close the gender gap. Proposed interventions prime for further evaluation include the implementation of formal sponsorship programs, the development of structured networking opportunities, and the promotion of women-focused organizations.",2025,Jan,Cancer,131,1,e35667,,10.1002/cncr.35667,39612169,#55,Callander 2025,"",""
Does gender disparity exist in neurosurgery training? Evidence from a nationwide survey from Pakistan.,Shakir M; Irshad HA; Altaf A; Ladak S; Aziz HF; Enam SA,"Gender disparities are prevalent in the neurosurgical field, particularly for female trainees, despite the growing demand for neurosurgeons. The situation is bleaker in low-and middle-income countries, where gender disparities among neurosurgical trainees have not been evaluated. We aimed to gauge the gender differences in opportunities and perceptions of neurosurgery training in Pakistan by comparing responses between males and females. A nationwide web-based survey was conducted in Pakistan, covering 22 College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan (CPSP) accredited neurosurgery training programs. Convenience sampling was used with a pilot-tested questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 26. A total of 120 trainees participated in our survey. The mean age of the participants was 30.4 ± 4.1 years, with 29.2% females and 70.8% males. Concerns about gender equity were more among females (34.3%) than males (27.1%). Poor work-life balance was reported by more females (34.3%) than males (30.6%). Burnout due to working hours was strongly agreed by more females (54.3%) than males (35.3%). More females (40%) acknowledged sufficient mentorship opportunities versus males (25%). Female respondents (65.7%) worked 50-100 hours per week, less than males (69.4%). Satisfaction with surgical exposure was lower among females (2.9%) compared to males (18.8%).

Differential Time-To-Promotion Trajectories Among Female and Male Neurosurgeons Contribute to Gender Disparities in Academic Rank Achievement.,Blitz SE; Hoffman SE; Stippler M; Huntoon K,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing representation of females in neurosurgical training, the fraction of female to male neurosurgeons decreases dramatically as faculty rank (Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor) increases. To assess this discrepancy, we quantified self-reported time-to-promotion trajectories for female and male neurosurgeons holding academic appointments. METHODS: In this cross-sectional institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, 147 female and 84 male neurosurgeons currently holding faculty positions in the US were contacted via email and invited to complete an anonymous, standardized survey. Respondents provided the calendar year of postgraduate training completion, promotion to different faculty ranks, geographic region of current practice (Western, Midwest, Southern, Northeast), and practice subspecialty. RESULTS: The response rate was 44.2% for females and 59.5% for males, with 114 participants included (65 female, 49 male). On average, female neurosurgeons required 25% longer to become an Associate Professor (P = 0.017), 34% longer to become a Full Professor (P = 0.004), 37% longer for promotion from Assistant to Associate Professor (P < 0.001), and 32% longer from Assistant to Full Professor (P = 0.012). Promotion timelines did not vary by region or specialty among male and female cohorts. Linear regressions revealed that female neurosurgeons with more recent training completion experienced shorter time-to-promotion to Associate and Full Professor compared to females of earlier generations (P = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively), while male timelines remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a significant delay in time-to-promotion for female neurosurgeons compared to their male counterparts.

"Gender Differences in the Authorship of Original Research in Pediatric Journals, 2001-2016.",Fishman M; Williams WA 2nd; Goodman DM; Ross LF,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the gender of authors of original research in 3 high-impact pediatric journals between 2001 and 2016, given the importance of publishing on academic promotion, and to compare authorship gender with the percentage of women on editorial boards and with academic faculty composition. STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the prevalence of female first and senior (last-listed) authorship of original research articles published in 3 pediatric-focused journals Pediatrics, JAMA Pediatrics (entitled Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine until 2013), and The Journal of Pediatrics. We also examined the gender breakdown of the main editors and the broader editorial boards of these journals. In addition, we examined whether junior female faculty co-authored with male or female senior faculty. RESULTS: Of 3895 original articles, 22 were excluded because the gender of either the first or senior author could not be determined from the name. An analysis of authorship by year showed increasing female representation across the selected journals in both first (39.8% in 2001, 57.7% in 2016) and senior (28.6% in 2001, 38.1% in 2016) authors, respectively. Editorial boards also showed increasing female representation (17.8% in 2001 to 39.8% in 2016).

Advancing Gender Equality in Healthcare Leadership: Protocol to Co-Design and Evaluate a Leadership and Mentoring Intervention in Tanzania.,Mucheru D; Mollel H; Gilmore B; Kesale A; McAuliffe E,"BACKGROUND: Women constitute almost two thirds of the health and social workforce. Yet, the proportion of women in decision-making positions remains significantly low leading to gender inequities in access to and appropriateness of healthcare. Several barriers which limit women's advancement to leadership positions have been documented and they generally constitute of gender stereotypes, discrimination and inhibiting systems; these hinderances are compounded by intersection with other social identities. Amelioration of the barriers has the potential to enhance women's participation in leadership and strengthen the existing health systems. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a proposed study aimed at addressing the organisational and individual barriers to the advancement of women to leadership positions in the Tanzanian health sector, and to evaluate the influence on leadership competencies and career advancement actions of the female health workforce. METHOD: The study utilises a gender transformative approach, co-design and implementation science in the development and integration of a leadership and mentorship intervention for women in the Tanzanian health context. The key steps in this research include quantifying the gender ratio in healthcare leadership; identifying the individual and organisational barriers to women's leadership; reviewing existing leadership, mentorship and career advancement interventions for women; recruiting programme participants for a leadership and mentorship programme; running a co-design workshop with programme participants and stakeholders; implementing a leadership and mentorship programme; and conducting a collaborative evaluation and lessons learnt. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the notion that progression towards gender equality in healthcare leadership is attained by fashioning a system that supports the advancement of women. We also argue that one of the pivotal indicators of progress towards the gender equality sustainable development goal is the number of women in senior and middle management positions, which we hope to further through this research.",2024,,Ann Glob Health,90,1,24,,10.5334/aogh.4374,38550609,#61,Mucheru 2024,"",""

Gender Equality Training for Students in Higher Education: Protocol for a Scoping Review.,Condron C; Power M; Mathew M; Lucey SM,"BACKGROUND: The principles of gender equality are integral to the goals, targets, and indicators of all sustainable development goals. Higher education institutes can be powerful agents for promoting gender equality, diversity, and inclusion not only in the higher education context but also in society as a whole. To address and overcome gender inequality in the higher education environment, experts posit that change needs to occur from day 1 of the student's academic experience. To this end, training is required. A preliminary review of the literature indicates that multiple gender equality-based training programs or initiatives for students have been designed and evaluated in second and third-level education settings. Examples of educational activities undertaken include delivery of didactic teaching, participation in a face-to-face collaboration project, site visits, case studies, and coaching. Yet, our initial search indicated that, to date, a comprehensive review collating the available evidence on gender equality training for third-level students has not yet been carried out. OBJECTIVE: Our review seeks to identify and explore the existing literature on gender equality training interventions for third-level students, with a particular emphasis on training content, methodology, and outcome evaluation. METHODS: This scoping review will be structured using the Arskey and O'Malley's 5-stage framework and will consider empirical research and other relevant published works that address gender equality training. Systematic searches will be carried out in 6 research databases and the gray literature using key search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been defined, and a data charting tool created to methodically extract information from selected literature. The free web software Rayyan will be used for primary screening where each reference will be screened in duplicate first by title, then abstract, and finally by full text.

Does gender matter? Differences between students at an interprofessional training ward.,Lindh Falk A; Hammar M; Nyström S,"Studies on graduates' transitions from education into clinical work highlight inequalities concerning how women and men experience their professional learning and development.

Students from the medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy programmes collaborate in teams during two weeks at one of three IPTWs at the medical school, Linköping University. They together take the responsibility for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of the patients, albeit with professional supervisors as support. During 2010 to 2011, 454 (93%) of the 488 students who practiced at the IPTWs answered a questionnaire on their experiences of the IPTW. The students stated that the IPTW had positively influenced their professional development. The female and male medical students were significantly less positive than other female and male students, respectively, concerning the value of IPTW. The male students from all programmes were slightly, but significantly, less positive than all the female students. These findings show that students ""do gender"" as an integral part of the educational practice.

For a cross-sectional qualitative study, a survey was distributed exclusively to 300 practicing orthopaedic surgeons and orthopaedists in training (residents and fellows). A total of 99 women participated in the survey, of whom 66 were practicing orthopaedic surgeons and 33 were orthopaedists in training. The study showed that women orthopaedic surgeons in training in Brazil have a lower number of publications and a moderate level of involvement in academic society activity. In addition, orthopaedic surgeons in training experience a statistically significantly higher number of conflicts in the workplace. The comments from the questionnaires highlighted the physical and psychological consequences arising from these situations of professional conflict, most frequently occurring with orthopaedic surgeons who are men. Our findings indicate that respondents expressed a feeling of inequality towards women in the workplace, ultimately reducing the level of job satisfaction among female orthopaedic surgeons, which may contribute to disinterest and abandonment of the specialty. The results of this work support recent evidence that there is an implicit and often overlooked bias against the participation of women and ethnic minorities in the orthopaedic community in Brazil.",2024,May,Cureus,16,5,e61325,,10.7759/cureus.61325,38947667,#66,Amaral 2024,"",""
"New Technologies Smart, or Harm Work-Family Boundaries Management? Gender Differences in Conflict and Enrichment Using the JD-R Theory.",Ghislieri C; Emanuel F; Molino M; Cortese CG; Colombo L,"Background: The relationship between technology-assisted supplemental work and well-being outcomes is a recent issue in scientific literature. Whether the use of technology for work purpose in off-work time may have a positive or negative impact on work-family balance remains an open question and the role of gender in this relationship is poorly understood. Aim: According to the JD-R theory, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between off-work hours technology assisted job demand (off-TAJD) and both work-family conflict (WFC) and work-family enrichment (WFE). Moreover, it considered two general job demands, workload and emotional dissonance, and one job resource, supervisory coaching. Method: The hypotheses were tested with a convenience sample of 671 workers. Data were collected with a self-report questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS 23 and through multi-group structural equation model (SEM) (Mplus 7). Results: The estimated SEM [Chi-square (510) = 1041.29; p < 0.01; CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.06 (0.05, 0.06); SRMR = 0.05. M = 319/F = 352] showed that off-TAJD was positively related to WFC in both subsamples; off-TAJD was positively related also to WFE only in the Male group. Workload was positively related to WFC in both Male and Female subsamples. Emotional dissonance was positively related to WFC in both subsamples and was negatively related to WFE. Supervisory coaching was strongly, positively related to WFE in both groups, and only in the Male subsample presented a low negative relationship with WFC. Conclusion: This study contributes to the literature on new challenges in work-life interface by analyzing the association between off-TAJD and WFC and Enrichment. Our findings suggest it is important to pay attention to gender differences in the study of the impact of supplemental work carried out during off-work hours using technology on the work-life interface. In fact, employee perception of Company demands of being available during off-work time, with the use of technology, may have different consequences for men and women, indicating potential differences in the centrality of the working role. Practical implications, at both cultural and organizational levels, should address the use of technology during leisure time.",2017,,Front Psychol,8,,1070,,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01070,28713300,#67,Ghislieri 2017,"",""
Gender differences in salary of internal medicine residency directors: a national survey.,Willett LL; Halvorsen AJ; McDonald FS; Chaudhry SI; Arora VM,"OBJECTIVES: Whether salary disparities exist between men and women in medical education leadership roles is not known. The study objective was to determine whether salary disparities exist between male and female Internal Medicine residency program directors, and if so, to identify factors associated with the disparities and explore historical trends. METHODS: The annual Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) survey in August 2012 included items to assess the salary and demographic characteristics of program directors, which were merged with publically available program data. To assess historical trends, we used similarly obtained survey data from 2008 to 2011. The study included program directors of 370 APDIM member programs, representing 95.6% of the 387 accredited Internal Medicine training programs in the United States and Puerto Rico. Of the 370 APDIM member programs, 241 (65.1%) completed the survey, of whom 169 (70.1%) were men and 72 (29.9%) were women. Program directors' total annual salary, measured in $25,000 increments, ranged from $75,000 or less to more than $400,000. Historical trends of mode salary by gender from 2008 to 2012 were assessed. RESULTS: The mode salary was $200,000 to 225,000 for men and $175,000 to $200,000 for women (P = .0005). After controlling for academic rank, career in general internal medicine, and program director age, the distribution of salary remained different by gender (P = .004). Historical trends show that the difference in mode salary has persisted since 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Leaders in academic medical centers, residency and fellowship directors, and all faculty in medical education need to be aware that salary disparities cited decades ago persist in this sample of medical educators.

As the majority of empirical evidence to date has adopted an androcentric view of strength and conditioning, a potential knowledge gap exists regarding sex-related differences in physical preparation and coaching approaches. Therefore, this study explored the attitudes, beliefs and practices of strength and conditioning coaches (n = 8; M/F, 6/2) in elite level (international) women's rugby union using semi-structured interviews (mean ±standard deviation duration 59 ± 15 min). The interviews explored differences in coaching practices for elite female rugby players compared to males, with a specific focus on the interpersonal aspects of the athlete-coach relationship. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to generate a rich qualitative dataset. The analysis resulted in the identification of higher order themes: athlete engagement, and interpersonal approach. The coaches in this study consistently perceived important differences between male and female players in factors related to engagement and interpersonal approach.

It aims to illuminate the representation of female authors in high-impact IR journals, highlighting ongoing challenges in achieving gender diversity, especially in leadership roles. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was conducted on articles published from 2008 to 2023, systematically assessing trends in female first and last authorships, as well as their overall contribution to total authorship within prominent IR journals. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a fluctuating trajectory in female authorship. Female first authorship peaked in 2011, followed by a decline through 2012-2013, and subsequently rebounded by 2023. Female last authorship exhibited a similar non-linear pattern, with an initial decline from 2008 to 2013, before gradually increasing in recent years. Overall, the presence of female authors in IR publications has steadily grown, with a notable rise in the proportion of publications featuring female authors and an increase in the average number of female contributors per article by 2023.

The present study compares changes in the percentage of residents with mentors in 1999 and in 2004, while considering current residents' perceptions of their mentors, with particular attention focused on what role race and gender might play in resident-mentor interactions. METHOD: A survey was administered to 4, 721 residents who took the 2004 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology in-training examination. Data are reported for respondents from four racial categories: white, African American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander. Results were compared to those of a similar survey administered in 1999. Responses were analyzed by chi-square analysis and univariate analyses of variance. RESULTS: The response rate was 97%. Most residents (64.9%) reported having a mentor. White female residents were least likely to have a mentor. Compared to results from 1999, the percentage of residents with a mentor, and the percentage of residents with female mentors, has increased. For all residents, personal rapport, knowledge of the field, and similarity in professional interests were the three most important factors in choosing a mentor. The proportion of residents reporting explicit discussions about career options has declined since 1999. DISCUSSION: Ethnic minorities are more likely than white residents to have a mentor, and to report that their mentors provide helpful advice. Although the proportion of residents with a mentor has increased since 1999, the quality of the mentoring relationship is meeting resident expectations but not exceeding them.",2005,Fall,J Contin Educ Health Prof,25,4,268-77,,10.1002/chp.40,16365902,#71,Coleman 2005,"",""

"Addressing inequities in research for early to mid-career women scientists in low- and middle-income countries: ""Supporting Women in Science"" programme.",Das JK; Raza M; Padhani ZA; Hussain NF; Villar J; Kennedy S; Bhutta ZA,"INTRODUCTION: The gender disparities and inequities faced by women in academia are widespread, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The scholarly output of women scientists remains significantly lower than that of men due to limited opportunities. This widening gap has significant implications for policy-making and prioritizing agendas. The Supporting Women in Science (SWIS) programme aims to address these barriers by enhancing research capacity among early- and mid-career women scientists from LMIC regions such as South-Central Asia and East Africa, in bespoke areas of health and health-related sustainable development goals (HHSDGs). METHODS: The SWIS programme utilizes online and distance learning with a self-paced approach. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, through a pre-defined eligibility criterion. Phase I involves online self-learning courses covering a core and elective curriculum over 6 months which is then evaluated in Phase II. Eligible candidates then move to Phase III, a mentored fellowship where they develop research proposals and receive funding for research project development, implementation, and evaluation. The rigorous reporting and monitoring mechanisms track compliance and progress. The online format, offered at no cost, enhances program accessibility, particularly in the post-COVID era. Additionally, SWIS prioritizes mentorship by selecting experienced professionals with strong research backgrounds and mentorship skills to guide participants. The programme evaluation will be based on selected success metrics including program completion ratio, funding opportunities availed by the participants, and generated scholarly output and presentations at key events. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Securing grant funding is pivotal for career advancement, yet women applicants face greater challenges as compared to men. The SWIS programme not only equips participants with knowledge and skills but also facilitates practical application through a simulated process, enabling participants to pursue future funding opportunities. Capacity-building initiatives like SWIS are crucial interventions to empower women scientists, foster equitable representation in academia, and create inclusive research environments and the programme acts as a steppingstone for future global leaders.",2024,,Front Glob Womens Health,5,,1386809,,10.3389/fgwh.2024.1386809,39669110,#74,Das 2024,"",""

The Toxicity of Self-Blame: Sex Differences in Burnout and Coping in Internal Medicine Trainees.,Spataro BM; Tilstra SA; Rubio DM; McNeil MA,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is a significant problem facing internal medicine residents contributing to increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation. Coping mechanisms and burnout may differ based on sex. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cross-sectional study of reported burnout and coping mechanisms used by internal medicine residents in June 2014 at a large academic center and its community affiliate. Two hundred eighty-five postgraduate year (PGY)-1, 2, 3, and 4 and incoming PGY-1 residents were surveyed. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced were given to measure levels of burnout and frequency of use of coping mechanisms. Percentages of residents who met criteria for burnout and high levels on each of the subscales of emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy, were calculated and stratified by sex. Chi-squared tests were used for statistical significance. Average frequency of use of each coping mechanism by sex was calculated with statistical significance determined by two sided t-tests. RESULTS: There was a 69% completion rate (198/285) with 100 men and 98 women. Woman had higher levels of burnout (30% vs. 15%, p = 0.014) and emotional exhaustion (22% vs. 9%, p = 0.005). Women used the adaptive coping mechanisms of emotional support (p = 0.001) and instrumental support (p = 0.018) more frequently but also used the maladaptive coping mechanism of self-blame more frequently (p = 0.022).

One domain less explored is the regional distribution of WNs, facilitated by the hiring practices of neurosurgical departments across the US. In this analysis, the authors coupled the stated practice location of WNs with regional geospatial data to identify hot spots and cold spots of prevalence and examined regional predictors of increases and decreases in WNs over time. METHODS: The authors examined the National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers of all neurosurgeons obtained via the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES), identifying the percentage of WNs in each county for which data were appended with data from the US Census Bureau. Change in WN rates was identified by calculating a regression slope for all years included (2015-2022). Hot spots and cold spots of WNs were identified through Moran's clustering analysis. Population and surgeon features were compared for hot spots and cold spots. RESULTS: WNs constituted 10.73% of all currently active neurosurgical NPIs, which has increased from 2015 (8.81%). Three hot spots were found-including the Middle Atlantic and Pacific divisions-that contrasted with scattered cold spots throughout the East Central regions that included Memphis as a major city. Although relatively rapidly growing, hot spots had significant gender inequality, with a median WN percentage of 11.38% and a median of 0.61 WNs added to each respective county per year. CONCLUSIONS: The authors analyzed the prevalence of WNs by using aggregated data from the NPPES and US Census Bureau.

Building an Equitable Surgical Training Pipeline: Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES).,Santos-Parker JR; Santos-Parker KS; Caceres J; Vargas GM; Kwakye G; Englesbe MJ; Valbuena VSM,"OBJECTIVE: Underrepresented minority (URM) medical students face many educational challenges. Barriers include lack of equitable representation, scarce mentorship, and the effects of systemic racism. For students interested in diversity and health equity, perceptions of surgical culture may discourage pursuing surgical specialties. We describe a national pilot for a novel surgical pipeline program, Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES), which utilizes early exposure, mentorship, and community building to empower URM students in pursuit of academic surgical careers. DESIGN: A 4-week virtual program included pairing students with faculty research mentors, virtual skills sessions, and seminars on leadership, advocacy, and career development. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews before and after participation, assessing experiences with mentorship and research, interest in surgery, career aspirations, and perceived barriers to career goals. SETTING: Department of Surgery, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Rising second-year medical students. RESULTS: All 3 participants were Latinx; 2 were first-generation college students. Participants had no surgical mentorship and limited research exposure, citing a desire to learn research methodology, connect with mentors, and build towards a career working with underserved communities as motivating factors for participation. Perceived barriers to a surgical career included surgical culture, burnout, and lack of research expertise or academic network necessary for success. At completion of the program, participants described several themes: (1) new positive perspective on academic surgical culture, (2) interest and confidence in research, (3) hope for improving health disparities, (4) networking and longitudinal mentorship connections contributing to a sense of surgical community, and (5) eagerness to share resources with colleagues at their home institutions.

Position-specific performance indicators that discriminate between successful and unsuccessful teams in elite women's indoor field hockey: implications for coaching.,Vinson D; Peters DM,"The aim of this investigation was to establish median performance profiles for the six playing positions in elite women's indoor hockey and then identify whether these position-specific profiles could discriminate between qualifying (top four), mid-table and relegated teams in the 2011-2012 England Hockey premier league. Successful passing in relegated teams was significantly lower (P < 0.008) than in mid-table and qualifying teams in four of the five outfield positions. Furthermore, the right backs of qualifying teams demonstrated significantly fewer (P < 0.008) unsuccessful passes (x̃ = 15.5 ± CLs 15.0 and 10.0, respectively) and interceptions (x̃ = 4.0 ± CLs 4.0 and 3.0, respectively) than relegated teams (x̃ = 19.5 ± CLs 21.0 and 17.0; x̃ = 7.5 ± CLs 8.0 and 6.0, respectively). Finally, the right forwards of relegated teams demonstrated significantly fewer (P < 0.008) successful interceptions (x̃ = 4.0 ± CLs 5.0 and 4.0, respectively) than qualifying teams (x̃ = 5.0 ± CLs 6.0 and 3.0, respectively) and significantly more (P < 0.008) unsuccessful interceptions (x̃ = 5.5 ± CLs 6.0 and 4.0, respectively) than mid-table teams (x̃ = 3.0 ± CLs 3.0 and 2.0, respectively).

Therefore, this study aims to explore the attitudes and perceived barriers among Jordanian medical students, particularly women. METHODS: An online, self-administered questionnaire, developed after an extensive literature review, was disseminated across all six Jordanian medical schools targeting more than 5000 medical students. Student t-test and ANOVA were used to document mean differences among different groups. Linear and logistic regression models were used to find predictors of publication and number of publications. RESULTS: A total of 636 students participated in the survey with a women to men ratio of 1.1.

Social capital as a catalyst for gender inequality: A scoping review of networking disparities in academic medicine,Callander J.K.; ; Johnson D.E.; Grandis J.R.,"Gender disparities in academic medicine persist despite gender parity among medical school graduates. Women remain underrepresented in higher academic ranks and leadership roles, with significant differences in retention, promotion, and compensation. In this scoping review, the authors explore the role of networking and social capital in exacerbating these disparities. The literature reviewed highlights the importance of networking in obtaining leadership roles, decreasing social isolation, and enhancing retention. Sponsorship, distinct from mentorship, is vital for career development and has a direct impact on professional growth. However, women are often under-sponsored compared with men, limiting their access to influential networks. In addition, virtual networking platforms and women-focused organizations offer promising alternatives to traditional, male-dominated networking activities. Despite the progress made, informal networking practices and gender biases continue to exclude women from key opportunities. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at enhancing the social capital of women in academic medicine to help close the gender gap.

Does Sponsorship Promote Equity in Career Advancement in Academic Medicine? A Scoping Review,Schwartz R.; ; Williams M.F.; Feldman M.D.,"Sponsorship describes a set of actions wherein an influential champion (sponsor) uses their position to actively support a colleague's career by helping them gain visibility, recognition, and/or positions. There is growing awareness of the importance of sponsorship for career advancement in academic medicine, particularly for women and those who are historically underrepresented and excluded in medicine (UIM). This scoping review examines the current landscape of evidence, and knowledge gaps, on sponsorship as it relates to career advancement in academic medicine for women and UIM faculty. We searched peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS) over the past 50 years (from 1973 through July 2023). Sixteen studies were included in the final review. We found relative consensus on sponsorship definition and value to career advancement. Heterogeneity in study design limited our ability to directly compare study outcomes. All included studies focused on gender differences in sponsorship: two of four quantitative studies found men were more likely to receive sponsorship, one reported no gender differences, and one was insufficiently powered. All but one of the qualitative studies reported gender differences, with women less likely to access or be identified for sponsorship. The mixed-methods studies suggested sponsorship may vary by career stage. Only two studies analyzed sponsorship for UIM populations. The existing data are inconclusive regarding best ways to measure and assess sponsorship, what institutional support (e.g., structured programs, formal recognition, or incentives for sponsorship) should look like, and at what career stage sponsorship is most important. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critically important for understanding what sponsorship best practices, if any, should be used to promote equity in career advancement in academic medicine. We advocate for commitment at the institutional and national levels to develop new infrastructure for transparently and equitably supporting women and UIM in career advancement.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.",2024,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,39,3,470EP  - 480,2026974198,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08542-4,38055164,#102,Schwartz 2024,"",""

Does gender still matter in the pursuit of a career in anaesthesia?,Stewart C.H.; ; Carter J.; Purcell N.; Balkin M.; Birch J.; Pearce G.C.; Makar T.,"A survey sent to fellows of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) aimed to document issues affecting gender equity in the anaesthesia workplace. A response rate of 38% was achieved, with women representing a greater proportion of respondents (64.2%). On average women worked fewer hours than men and spent a larger percentage of time in public practice; however, satisfaction rates were similar between genders. There was a gender pay gap which could not be explained by the number of hours worked or years since achieving fellowship. The rates of bullying and harassment were high among all genders and have not changed in 20 years since the first gender equity survey by Strange Khursandi in 1998. Women perceived that they were more likely to be discriminated against particularly in the presence of other sources of discrimination, and highlighted the importance of the need for diversity and inclusion in anaesthetic workplaces. Furthermore, women reported higher rates of caregiving and unpaid domestic responsibilities, confirming that anaesthetists are not immune to the factors affecting broader society despite our professional status. The overall effect was summarised by half of female respondents reporting that they felt their gender was a barrier to a career in anaesthesia. While unable to be included in statistics due to low numbers, non-binary gendered anaesthetists responded and must be included in all future work. The inequities documented here are evidence that ANZCA's gender equity subcommittee must continue promoting and implementing policies in workplaces across Australia and New Zealand.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2023.",2024,/,Anaesthesia and Intensive Care,52,2,113EP  - 126,2026844142,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0310057X231212210,38006609,#104,Stewart 2024,"",""
Pediatric Emergency Medicine and Mentoring: What Women Want,Bechtel K.; ; Langhan M.L.; Levine D.; Hanson J.,"Background Women in medicine have reported gender-specific obstacles to career success, such as a dearth of mentors and role models. Pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) is a female-dominated subspecialty of pediatrics yet is still impacted by gender inequality in many areas. No previous study has explored mentoring experiences of women PEM physicians and the impact on their career trajectory. We sought to explore the experiences of female PEM physicians with mentorship to determine aspects of mentoring that were successful or unsuccessful. Methods This was a qualitative study with criterion sampling of female PEM physicians. Members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Emergency Medicine completed semistructured interviews in 2022, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Our research team consisted of 3 PEM physicians. Using the constant comparative method, we analyzed transcripts by inductively developing codes, grouping codes into categories, and refining codes, descriptions, and group assignments to identify themes. Interpretations of and relationships among themes were iteratively discussed and revised by the team. Results Twenty-two participants were interviewed via telephone. The mean age of participants was 44 years old, and the majority (73%) identified as White, non-Hispanic, and at the rank of assistant professor (45%). Four themes were identified: (1) benefits of mentorship (recognition of need for mentorship and finding professional success), (2) finding mentors (processes to find mentors and mentor roles), (3) characteristics of successful mentors (personal and professional), and (4) impact of mentorship (career advancement or career sabotage). Conclusions We identified 4 themes that could be incorporated into mentoring programs and are associated with successful experiences for women PEM physicians. The detail and descriptions in our data provide guidance for mentoring programs that specifically address the needs of women in PEM.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Women in the Operating Room: The Role of Mentorship in Challenging the Gendered Norms of Surgical Practices,Htite E.D.; ,"Historically, surgery has been considered an inherently ""masculine"" profession. This persistent stereotype has led to gender inequality in currently practicing surgeons, despite gender parity of newly admitted medical students in North America. Since women began practising medicine in the 19th century, these norms began to be challenged in tandem with the suffragette movement. In the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, pioneering female physicians and surgeons worked together to establish spaces where women would be welcomed and mentored the next generation of female surgeons. In this essay, I highlight prominent women physicians and surgeons that have contributed to the presence of women in the operating room through mentorship.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.",2024,/,American Surgeon,,"(Htite) Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada",,2030133486,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00031348241260270,38849125,#107,Htite 2024,"",""
Gender and Mentorship in Military Medicine: A Survey Study,Cole R.; ; Zurbrugg K.; Lee Y.; Dong T.; Bunin J.; Granite G.; Barak A.; Rudinsky S.L.,"INTRODUCTION: Mentorship is essential for professional development and advancement within the military. In civilian medicine, the intersection between gender and mentorship holds important implications for research opportunities, academic success, and career progression. However, the intersection of gender and mentorship has not yet been explored within the field of military medicine. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the role of gender in mentorship within the field of military medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated gender and mentorship within military medicine by developing and distributing a 16-item Likert survey to active-duty military physicians. We used the Chi-squared test of independence and the independent samples t-test to examine the role of gender in mentorship among the 16 questions. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The male respondents reported more same-gender mentors than females (male [M]: 61.9% vs. female [F]: 33.0%), whereas the female respondents had significantly more mentors of the opposite gender than males (M: 12.4% vs. F: 47.3%). A higher proportion of males indicated no preference compared to females. Conversely, a significant preference for a same-sex mentor was expressed by female respondents compared to male respondents (M: 5.2% vs. F: 30.1%). In contrast, female respondents considered having a mentor more important than their male counterparts (t(206) = -2.26, P = .012, F: 3.86 vs. M: 3.57). Both male and female respondents had significantly more female mentees ($\chi _{\left( 1 \right)}^2$ = 12.92, P < .001, Cramer's V = 0.254). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While the female participants in our study preferred female mentors, the male participants had more same-gender mentors than the female participants. In addition, more females reported that they did not have the time to be mentored. Our results, therefore, suggest that training males to be better mentors to females and providing accessible mentorship training to females may promote equitable career development within military medicine.<ovid:br/>Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2024.

A Coaching-Based Leadership Program for Women Postdoctoral Fellows at the National Cancer Institute that Cultivates Self-confidence and Persistence in STEMM,Sutton S.; ; Palmisano A.; Ginsburg E.,"Despite making strides in gender equality, women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) continue to face a persistent underrepresentation in leadership roles. In an effort to reverse this trend, the National Cancer Institute created the Sallie Rosen Kaplan (SRK) Postdoctoral Fellowship, a year-long coaching-based leadership training program. The SRK program aims to empower women to explore careers across a broad range of fields, including academia, industry, and government, and to excel in leadership positions in those fields. Analyzing a decade of data from 111 participants, we describe the positive impact of the SRK program on participant's self-reported capabilities. Increased self-confidence, improved time management and work/life balance, enhanced goal-setting and attainment skills, and strengthened communication and relationship-building abilities are highlighted as statistically significant outcomes. Moreover, the program's emphasis on coaching, mentorship, peer cohort support, and building lasting professional relationships also contributed to high ratings for satisfaction and value of the program. Successful programs like SRK can serve as a model for institutions striving to close gender gaps in leadership.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

The evolution of leadership: analyzing the presidents of American Dermatology Societies overtime,Abushukur Y.; ; Mansour M.; Cascardo C.; Keeley J.; Knackstedt T.,"Within organized dermatology, it is imperative that leaders embody a diverse group of individuals, reflective of the dermatologists they represent and the greater U.S. population. Despite women constituting more than half of the dermatologic workforce, they represent a leadership minority in dermatology society higher level positions. This gap is evident by fewer women holding presidency positions within prominent dermatological societies; however, a comprehensive comparison across multiple societies has yet to be made. Our study analyzes and compares demographic as well as academic metrics of presidents from 16 prominent dermatology societies spanning 22 years, 2000-2021. Data were collected using organization websites, which demonstrated 247 unique presidents over 22 years. Of these presidents, 175 (70.9%) were male and 72 (29.1%) were female. Surgically focused societies had 63 (87.5%) male presidents and nine (12.5%) female presidents, while clinically focused societies had 112 (64.0%) male presidents and 63 (36.0%) female presidents (P < 0.0002). The publication h-index, academic rank, chairmanship, and number of advanced degrees, and total number of years in practice prior to election did not significantly differ between male and female leaders. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of female presidents across all societies between 2000 and 2021 by Cochran Armitage Trend Test. However, between 2016 and 2021, 35% of presidents were female and a general trend toward more gender balance may be noticed.

"International Women in Biomechanics: Promoting, supporting, and sustaining the careers of women in biomechanics",Ebrahimi A.; ; Daniels K.A.J.; Gaffney B.M.M.; Banks C.L.; McDonald K.A.; Kessler S.E.; Maharaj J.N.,"Gender biases and inequities are prevalent across many scientific fields and biomechanics is likely no exception. While progress has been made to support women in the field, especially at biomechanics society conferences, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated professional isolation. The International Women in Biomechanics (IWB) community started in July 2020 with the mission of fostering an environment for women and other under-represented genders in biomechanics to gain year-round support, visibility, and allyship. Nearly 700 biomechanists have joined the IWB community from over 300 universities/organizations and 33 countries. Our community ranges in career stages and professions and interacts through a forum-style platform, teleconference meetings, and social media. In 2021, we conducted a survey to identify the needs, concerns, and issues faced by individuals in the IWB community. We received 144 responses from members in 16 countries. Our survey revealed three primary needs for women in biomechanics: supportive working environments, career planning support, and addressing workplace gender bias. These results, in conjunction with scientific evidence on workforce gender bias, helped us identify three key areas to meet our mission: Member Support, Community Outreach, and Empowering Allyship. Several levels of support are required in these three areas to ensure a lasting, positive, and sustainable impact on gender equity in biomechanics. We conclude by providing our perspectives on an evidence-based call to action to continue addressing gender bias and inequity at the individual, institutional, and scientific society levels. These actions can collectively enhance our allyship for women in the field of biomechanics.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022",2023,/,Journal of Biomechanics,146,"(Ebrahimi) Independent Researcher, Rockville, MD, United States(Daniels) Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom(Gaffney) University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, United States(Banks) Cen",111419,2022015537,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111419,36587460,#113,Ebrahimi 2023,"",""
Women Authorship Trends in the Highest-Impact Anesthesiology Journals from 2005 to 2021,Keim A.A.; ; Pelkey M.N.; Broadfoot J.E.; Folley T.A.; Kraus M.B.; Maloney J.A.; Strand N.H.; Misra L.,"Background: Although women and men have matriculated into medical schools in similar proportions since the 1980s, recent data indicate that anesthesiology is lagging in gender equity, especially in academic leadership roles.1,2 As promotion in academic medicine is strongly influenced by publications, understanding whether a lack of women authorship is contributing to this gender gap is crucial.3,4 This article aims to assess how woman authorship trends have changed in the last 16 years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The five highest impact journals in anesthesia were identified as Journal of Clinical Anesthesia, British Journal of Anaesthesia, Anesthesiology, PAIN, and Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine. Number of total authors, including women, men, and unknown gender authors as well as incidence of woman first and/or last author, was documented from articles published in 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2021. <ovid:br/>Result(s): This analysis shows that women are gaining representation in anesthesia publications. Overall, there was a statistically significant increase in the total number of women authors and women first and last authorship. However, as of 2021, women still only represented ~40% of total and first authors and ~24% of last authors. In addition, increase in first/last woman authorship was not present in all journals when stratified. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These journal differences may suggest the editorial evaluation process as a potential source of gender bias. There was a statistically significant relationship between women senior authors and articles with 50% or more women authors, indicating that woman mentorship is contributing to closing equity gap.

Monitoring and evaluation in the professional development of EDI practitioners,Leung A.; ,"Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are fundamental functions in the international development sector; they are however less known - although they are already being carried out to some extent - in advancing equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in higher education. Adapting the definitions provided by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank [1] to the EDI context, monitoring can be defined as a continuing function that uses systematic collection of data on specified indicators to provide management and the main stakeholders of EDI interventions with indications of the extent of progress and achievement of objectives. Evaluation, on the other hand, can be defined as the process of determining the worth or significance of EDI activities or programmes to determine the relevance of objectives, the efficacy of design and implementation, the efficiency of resource use, and the sustainability of results. An evaluation should also enable the incorporation of lessons learned into decision-making processes. I would like to suggest three reasons why knowledge and skills of M&E are important elements in developing the careers of EDI practitioners in higher education. First, M&E help ensure that EDI activities are data-driven and evidence- based. With M&E data and evidence, EDI practitioners can justify and account for resources and investment, as well as more confidently inform and influence decision makers in universities. The findings from M&E can also help universities share with other institute's their experiences in advancing EDI to benefit an even larger number of people. In addition, it can be argued that the Athena Swan charter has M&E principles embedded and therefore requires EDI practitioners to understand M&E; three notable examples are success measures, rationales and impact, all of which are key concepts of M&E. Second, universities are ideal environments for EDI practitioners to develop M&E capabilities. The knowledge and skills of M&E are not dissimilar to those of social science research; for example, both require defining problems/issues and objectives, designing data collection tools and analysing data. Given the similarities and the fact that most universities are staffed with experienced social scientists, universities are well resourced to provide training for their EDI practitioners. Third, skills involved in conducting M&E are transferrable and can be used to pursue careers in multiple sectors. These transferrable skills include project management, data management, data analysis, communication and strategic planning. My project in the University of Oxford has enabled me (as an M&E specialist) to co-implement pilot initiatives with EDI practitioners as a meaningful way to share knowledge and skills of M&E. There are also ready-to-use guides on M&E available online; for example, the National Evaluation Guide for STEM equity programs [2] published by Women in STEM Ambassador in Australia is an excellent resource.",2023,/,BMC Proceedings,17,Supplement 15,,643048852,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12919-023-00275-w,,#116,Leung 2023,"",""
Mentoring for improving gender equality in academic psychiatry,Riecher-Rossler A.; ,"Although in many countries in the meantime more women than men choose medicine and later psychiatry for their training, key positions in hospitals and research are still mainly held by men. The professional career of women is impeded not only by institutional, but also by psychological barriers such as gender role behavior and gender role stereotypes. Mentoring can help young women to overcome these barriers. But usually mentoring starts too late. As studies have shown, important decisions about future career steps are taken already towards the end of medical studies. Therefore, gender sensitive teaching and mentoring should start already at university and should not only address young women, but also young men as potential partners and future colleagues - especially regarding their gender role behavior and stereotypes. Mentoring programs considering gender-specific needs should be implemented in the regular teaching during medical studies and in psychiatric training. Furthermore, women should be coached during their further career steps since there is not only a ""glass ceiling"" that excludes young women from achieving leadership roles. When they finally have achieved such a role, women often face further difficulties stemming from gender stereotypes and traditional gender roles. University teachers and employers should be addressed, as well as politicians.

"""Everybody needs a little MAGIC"": mid-career scientists reflect on the impact of Mentoring and Guidance in Careers (MAGIC) Workshops",Sikora J.; ; McKinnon M.,"Background Mentoring and Guidance in Careers Workshops (MAGIC) were fiveday long residential training and networking events held at the Australian National University (ANU), initiated by Professors Mahananda Dasgupta (physics - ANU) and Nalini Joshi (mathematics - University of Sydney) as part of their ARC Georgina Sweet Fellowships. Open to female-identifying scientists within the first seven years of their career in the typically male-dominated fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry and related fields, the fully-funded workshops attracted about 35 participants each year between 2017 and 2019. MAGIC aimed to provide participants with resources to enable long-term career planning and overcome cultural or institutional challenges to forge a successful career. Experts from academia, government and industry contributed to panel discussions and exercises and provided participants with individual assistance. Most importantly, participants shared their successes and the challenges they faced at the early stages of their careers with peers and senior leaders in cognate disciplines. Feedback immediately following each MAGIC workshop showed early-career scientists found MAGIC extraordinarily relevant and helpful - but did that withstand the test of time? Methods Towards the end of 2021, we interviewed 49 out of 106 participants, capturing comprehensive reflections on the perceived impact that MAGIC workshops had on participants' lives in the two to four years that followed.

4.74 Role of Peer Mentorship in Burnout Prevention and Well-Being of Resident Physicians: A Systematic Review,Agrawal A.; ; Singh J.; Aljader T.; Patel A.,"Objectives: Physician burnout is a growing problem in the healthcare industry, higher than other professions. This systematic review aims to assess if peer mentorship is an effective tool in combating and preventing burnout in resident physicians. It also aims to determine if characteristics of the mentorship, such as structured vs unstructured and self-initiated vs appointed areas of mentorship, contribute to an effective peer mentorship in the studies chosen. The third objective is to identify the ways in which peer mentorship helps combat burnout. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Three databases (PubMed, Medical Subject Headings [MeSH], and Google Scholar) were searched with the following keywords: Peer-mentorship, Burnout, Resident Mentorship, Technology, Peer-support, Early career, and Mentors, in different combinations. A total number of 67 articles were selected as per the inclusion criteria and relevancy to the research topic. Quality appraisal was done using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) checklist depending on the type of study, which resulted in a further reduction to 22 papers. The review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Peer mentorship can combat burnout and benefit resident physicians in many ways, including increased career satisfaction, posttraining planning, research publications, and even influence main career decisions such as joining academia. Peer mentorship was shown to decrease emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, foster a sense of community, and prevent loneliness in the workplace. Adequate mentorship is lacking, and gender disparity is an issue. The efficacy of different approaches, a focus on curriculum and career vs wellness, group vs one-to-one, and other areas, need further research. Formal and structured mentorship was shown to have superior effectiveness along with a focus on resident-specific goals. Being a mentor was also found to be fulfilling for an established physician. To note, self-initiation and effort showed better compatibility. Gender disparity needs to be kept in mind, with studies reporting decreased access to female-identifying individuals and inappropriate interactions between mentor and mentee. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Peer mentorship is an evidence-based tool that should be incorporated to prevent burnout in resident physicians.

Methods. We randomly selected five academic medical centers from the US World News & Reports top 100 medical school rankings that had ID division websites including a faculty listing with ranks and years since graduation. We recorded each physician faculty's rank and gender based on the written biography, using a validated tool (genderize.io) to determine gender if not given, and collected each faculty's traditional bibliometric data via Google Scholar. Results. We included 221 faculty (107 women) from five ID divisions (mean 44 faculty). Women accounted for 5/12 (42%) of instructors, 62/109 (57%) of assistant professors, 19/44 (43%) of associate professors, and 21/56 (38%) of full professors. Junior faculty women (instructor or assistant) had a median 0.6 potential same-gender senior mentors per mentee within their divisions versus 1.1 for men; associate professor women had a median 1.0 potential same-gender senior mentor per mentee versus 1.7 for men. Measures of academic productivity, such as annual publications, citations, and h-index growth since graduation from fellowship were similar between men and women. Conclusion. Our findings support published studies demonstrating lower proportions of women in successively senior positions within academic ID divisions despite similar scholarly activity and suggest that fewer within-institution opportunities for senior mentorship might be a contributing factor.",2023,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,10,Supplement 2,S482,643250512,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.927,,#121,Hollenberg 2023,"",""
WOMEN FACULTY AND FULL-TIME CLINICAL FACULTY MENTORSHIP NEEDS NOT MET WITH TRADITIONAL MENTORSHIP STRU CTU RES,Deshpande N.; ; Starks H.; Cornia P.B.; Sokol-Hessner L.; Chander G.; Mookherjee S.,"BACKGROUND: Mentorship is vital for academic medicine faculty career advancement, productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, yet specific mentoring needs and preferences are not well understood, particularly for full-time clinical faculty (FTC). There is a gender gap in advancement and promotion in academic medicine and mentorship is also vulnerable to bias. We surveyed our Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) faculty to determine gender and promotion pathway differences in 1) having mentors; 2) satisfaction with mentorship; 3) preferences for finding mentors; and 4) barriers to providing and receiving mentorship. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): DGIM includes 307 inpatient, outpatient and research faculty across multiple sites. We created a 24-item survey to assess the 4 domains above and examined the distribution of responses by gender and promotion track using chi-square tests. Faculty were invited to respond in October 2022. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 192 (63%) faculty completed the survey. 40 were not queried on satisfaction with mentors: 29 had <4 months in DGIM and we presumed their mentors were at prior institutions; 11 were unsure whether they had a mentor. Frequency: 107/192 (56%) faculty reported having at least 1 mentor; the proportion of faculty with mentors was similar for women (n=108, 54%) and men (n=79, 59%, p=0.667). There were significant differences by track among who had mentors (40/90, 44% FTC vs 46/58, 79% Clinician-Scholar, and 18/23, 78% Physician- Scientist, p<0.001). Satisfaction with current mentorship: 65% of faculty with mentors were satisfied. Similar proportions of women (67%) and men (64%) reported satisfaction with mentorship (p=0.895). Among faculty with mentors who were dissatisfied, 18% were CS, compared to 11% FTC and 6% PS (p=0.028). 28/52 (54%) faculty without mentors were dissatisfied with their lack of mentorship; most were FTC (n=17, 65%) or CS (n=9, 35%, p=0.002); all 4 PS with no mentor were satisfied. Preferences: More women preferred assistance (facilitated connection or mentor assignment) with finding a mentor to support promotion (52% vs 44% for men, p=0.044) and career development (80% vs 62%, p=0.009). More FTC, compared to CS or PS, preferred assistance with finding mentors for promotion (80% vs 66% vs 50%, p=0.001) and career development (77% vs 59% vs 42%, p=0.001). Barriers: Lack of time was the most prevalent barrier for both receiving (56%) and providing (58%) mentorship. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While many faculty reported satisfaction with current mentorship, we identified opportunities for improvement. Many faculty without mentors were dissatisfied by the lack of mentorship and FTC tended to lack mentorship. Women preferred facilitated connections with potential mentors.

WOMen profEssioNal developmenT oUtcome Metrics in Academic Emergency Medicine: Results from the WOMENTUM Modified Delphi Study,Love J.S.; ; Zeidan A.J.; Khatri U.G.; Samuels-Kalow M.E.; Mills A.M.; Hsu C.H.,"Introduction: To address persistent gender inequities in academic medicine, women professional development groups (PDG) have been developed to support the advancement of women in medicine. While these programs have shown promising outcomes, long-term evaluative metrics do not currently exist. The objective of this study was to establish metrics to assess women's PDGs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a modified Delphi study that included an expert panel of current and past emergency department (ED) chairs and Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine (AWAEM) presidents. The panel completed three iterative surveys to develop and rank metrics to assess women PDGs. Metrics established by the expert panel were also distributed for member-checking to women EM faculty. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The expert panel ranked 11 metrics with high to moderate consensus ranking with three metrics receiving greater than 90% consensus: gender equity strategy and plan; recruitment; and compensation. Members ranked 12 metrics with high consensus with three metrics receiving greater than 90% consensus: gender equity strategy and plan; compensation; and gender equity in promotion rates among faculty. Participants emphasized that departments should be responsible for leading gender equity efforts with PDGs providing a supportive role. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this study, we identified metrics that can be used to assess academic EDs' gender equity initiatives and the advisory efforts of a departmental women's PDG. These metrics can be tailored to individual departmental/institutional needs, as well as to a PDG's mission. Importantly, PDGs can use metrics to develop and assess programming, acknowledging that many metrics are the responsibility of the department rather than the PDG.<ovid:br/>Copyright: &#xa9; 2022 Love et al.

Impact of Mentoring on Academic Career Success for Women in Medicine: A Systematic Review,Shen M.R.; ; Tzioumis E.; Andersen E.; Wouk K.; McCall R.; Li W.; Girdler S.; Malloy E.,"PURPOSE: Research has shown that barriers to career success in academic medicine disproportionately affect women. These barriers include inadequate mentoring, which may perpetuate the underrepresentation of women in senior leadership positions. The purpose of this review was to summarize the qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of mentoring on women's career outcomes and to inform future interventions to support the promotion and retention of women in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The authors conducted a systematic review of original research published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals through March 20, 2020. Search terms related to mentorship, women, and academic medicine. The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Current Contents Connect via Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. They excluded studies not specifically addressing women and those without gender-stratified outcomes. They extracted and analyzed the following data: study design, population, sample size, response rate, participant age, percentage of women, mentoring prevalence, and outcomes. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of 2,439 citations identified, 91 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 65 quantitative and 26 qualitative studies. Mentoring was associated with objective and subjective measures of career success. Women perceived mentorship to be more valuable to their career development yet were more likely to report having no mentor. Additionally, women were more likely to report lower levels of research productivity, less career satisfaction, and greater barriers to promotion. Qualitative results indicated that women had less access to informal mentoring and family responsibilities had a greater effect on their career outcomes. Professional networking, female mentors, and relational aspects of mentoring were common themes. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This review examined gender disparities in mentoring and the impact on research productivity, promotion success, and career satisfaction for women in academic medicine. Institution-supported mentoring programs are needed to facilitate identification of appropriate mentors and promotion of a more equitable academic career environment for women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2022,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,97,3,444EP  - 458,636905494,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004563,34907962,#124,Shen 2022,"",""
Characteristics and Experiences of Women Physicians and Professionals in NAEMSP,Staats K.; ; Counts C.R.; Dyer K.S.; Stemerman R.; Braithwaite S.; Luke A.; Mercer M.P.,"Introduction: One of the six guiding principles of the EMS Agenda 2050 is to foster a socially equitable care delivery system. A specific recommendation within this principle is that ""local EMS leadership, educators and clinicians [should] reflect the diversity of their communities."" Research has shown that women comprise a minority of emergency medicine services (EMS) field clinicians. In academic settings, women are represented at lower rates among experienced EMS faculty than within Emergency Medicine clinicians or faculty at large. The reasons for these differences are also unknown. Little data exist describing the number or experience of female physicians and professionals in EMS. <ovid:br/>Purpose(s): Our objective was to describe the composition and experiences of EMS physicians, researchers and professionals who participate in the Women in EMS group of the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods descriptive study of women belonging to the Women in EMS Committee of NAEMSP. A survey was sent to the 143 members of this group using a list-serve, and the data was collected in Redcap. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Seventy-four people completed the survey. Respondents were 96% female, 82% Caucasian, 11% underrepresented minorities (URM), and 7% LGBTQI. Of the 88% that are physicians, 78% are board certified in Emergency Medicine, compared to 55% in EMS. Forty-eight percent reported they received some form of mentorship. Among these respondents, a minority reported female mentorship, which was usually from a remote rather than local mentor (41% vs. 15%). Eighty-three percent of respondents had experienced some form of discrimination or harassment in their career, but only 68% reported their workplace culture discourages such behavior. Thirty-three percent of respondents report receiving unequal recognition because of gender. Thematic evaluation of the qualitative responses showed that respondents felt there were fewer barriers to mentorship and professional advancement opportunities in local work versus national engagement. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In a survey evaluating representation of female professionals in EMS, participants reported on their career representations, and experiences of gender-based inequity within their EMS career settings.

Evaluation of two longitudinal faculty leadership training programs: behavioral change and institutional impact,Mayowski C.A.; ; Norman M.K.; Proulx C.N.; Hamm M.E.; Martin M.K.; Zellers D.F.; Rubio D.M.; Levine A.S.,"PURPOSE: Building leadership skills among faculty in academic medicine is essential, yet professional development programs focused on leadership are not always attentive to the needs of faculty on diverse career pathways or at differing career stages-nor are they often rigorously assessed. Evaluations commonly focus on participant satisfaction and short-term learning but not behavior change and institutional impact, which are difficult to assess but arguably more meaningful. Given the substantial time and money invested in these programs, more rigorous evaluation is critical. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors evaluated an intensive, shared leadership-focused training program for early-career and mid-career faculty, offered by the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine over the course of a year. They administered a pre/post-program assessment of confidence in key skill areas, and conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants between 1-4 years after program completion. FINDINGS: Participants in both programs showed statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) on every item measured in the pre/post-test. Analysis of the interviews revealed indications of substantial behavior change as well as institutional impact. The evaluation also suggested particular benefits for female professionals. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors conducted a long-term assessment of leadership training focused on career pathway and career stage and found that it (a) prompted both positive behavioral change and institutional impact and (b) suggested benefits for female faculty in particular, which could potentially help to eliminate gender-based disparities in leadership in academic medical centers.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,/,Journal of health organization and management,ahead-of-print,aheadofprint,,638199255,https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JHOM-03-2022-0088,35673769,#127,Mayowski 2022,"",""

A remote mentorship model for empowering students to undertake electrocardiology research: Effects on gender equity,Nam R.H.K.; ; Tse G.; Liu T.; Jeevaratnam K.; Lee S.,"Over the past years, there has been increasing awareness on female representation in cardiology, in particular senior academic ranks. Given the gender disparity in cardiology, female talents in cardiovascular academic medicine are significantly under-represented. In addition, whilst women have a slightly higher frequency of earning first authorships, it has been reported that women are 50% less likely to hold a senior authorship position. The drop in female representation in senior ranks of academic medicine may be contributed by a lack of female talent engagement, particularly during their early-career advancement, in high-impact journals and leadership roles. We present a remote, accessible-distributed research team model to help raise the female representation and tackle the challenges faced by female academics in the field of cardiovascular medicine. The group celebrates accessibility through open communication and collaboration, where mentees can seek research advice and ideas virtually from senior members and principal investigators. The decentralized system allows easy access for research guidance and inspirationand break down barriers in the lack of mentorship for early-career female talents. Students are empowered to lead their projects, and be involved in all phases- from the generation of study ideas to publication. The early development of holistic independent research skills equips students to become principal investigators and leaders in the future. The distributive element of the group is demonstrated through the decentralized research approach employed. Authorship is allocated based on intellectual contribution rather than on the acquisition of funding or seniority level.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022",2022,/,Journal of Electrocardiology,72,"(Nam, Tse, Lee) Medical Education Unit, Cardiovascular Analytics Group, China-UK Collaboration, Hong Kong, Hong Kong(Tse, Liu) Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ionic-Molecular Function of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Institute of Car",128EP  - 130,2017906450,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2022.04.004,35500432,#129,Nam 2022,"",""

Physicians were divided into those who never published, early-publishers (EP) who published within 2 years of graduation and late-publishers (LP). We analysed and compared the demographics, publication volume, publication quality as well as current mid-career position. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of 532 physicians, 185 were EP (34.8%), 220 were LP (41.3%), 127 (23.9%) never published, 491 (92.2%) became specialists and 122 (22.3%) achieved managerial position. Of the 405 who published, the average number of publications was 20.3 +/- 33.0, and median (IQR) 9(19). H-index was significantly higher in EP, males, surgical specialists, and those holding a managerial position. Male gender was associated with higher publication rate (OR = 1.742; 95% CI 1.193-2.544; P = 0.004). Using quantile regression, female gender was negatively associated with the number of publications in Q50-Q95. Surgical specialty and managerial position were positively associated with publications in Q25 to Q75 and early publication in Q25 and Q75. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): We found a strong association between EP and the number, impact, and quality of publications throughout their academic career.

"The impact of a faculty development program, the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP), on self-efficacy, academic promotion and institutional retention",Tung J.; ; Nahid M.; Rajan M.; Logio L.,"BACKGROUND: Academic medical centers invest considerably in faculty development efforts to support the career success and promotion of their faculty, and to minimize faculty attrition. This study evaluated the impact of a faculty development program called the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP) on participants' (1) self-ratings of efficacy, (2) promotion in academic rank, and (3) institutional retention. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Participants from the 2013-2020 LAMP cohorts were surveyed pre and post program to assess their level of agreement with statements that spanned domains of self-awareness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with work and work environment. Pre and post responses were compared using McNemar's tests. Changes in scores across gender were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Mann-Whitney tests. LAMP participants were matched to nonparticipant controls by gender, rank, department, and time of hire to compare promotions in academic rank and departures from the organization. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine differences. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were significant improvements in almost all self-ratings on program surveys (p < 0.05). Greatest improvements were seen in ""understand the promotions process"" (36% vs. 94%), ""comfortable negotiating"" (35% vs. 74%), and ""time management"" (55% vs. 92%). There were no statistically significant differences in improvements by gender, however women faculty rated themselves lower on all pre-program items compared to men. There was significant difference found in time-to-next promotion (p = 0.003) between LAMP participants and controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that LAMP faculty achieved next promotion more often and faster than controls. Cox-proportional-hazards analyses found that LAMP faculty were 61% more likely to be promoted than controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.23, p-value = 0.004). There was significant difference found in time-to-departure (p < 0.0001) with LAMP faculty retained more often and for longer periods. LAMP faculty were 77% less likely to leave compared to controls (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16-0.34, p < 0.0001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): LAMP is an effective faculty development program as measured subjectively by participant self-ratings and objectively through comparative improvements in academic promotions and institutional retention.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

What Women Need: a Study of Institutional Factors and Women Faculty's Intent to Remain in Academic Medicine,Onumah C.; ; Wikstrom S.; Valencia V.; Cioletti A.,"Background: A longstanding gender gap exists in the retention of women in academic medicine. Several strategies have been suggested to promote the retention of women, but there are limited data on impacts of interventions. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify what institutional factors, if any, impact women faculty's intent to remain in academic medicine, either at their institutions or elsewhere. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A survey was designed to evaluate institutional retention-linked factors, programs and interventions, their impact, and women's intent to remain at their institutions and within academic medicine. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics and regression analyses. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Women with faculty appointments within departments of medicine recruited from national organizations and specific social media groups. Main Measures: Institutional factors that may be associated with women's decision to remain at their current institutions or within academic medicine. Key Results: Of 410 surveys of women at institutions across the USA, fair and transparent family leave policies and opportunities for work-life integration showed strong associations with intent to remain at one's institution (leave policies: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.20-4.18, p = 0.01; work-life: OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.50-9.64, p < 0.001) and within academic medicine (leave policies: OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.09-5.03, p = 0.03; work-life: OR 4.66, 95% CI 2.04-11.36, p < 0.001). Other institutional factors associated with intent to remain in academics include peer mentorship (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.56-6.57, p < 0.01) and women role models (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.68, p = 0.04).

"Coaching, Mentoring, and Sponsoring as Career Development Tools",Seehusen D.A.; ; Rogers T.S.; Al Achkar M.; Chang T.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coaching, mentoring, and sponsoring are tools academic leaders can utilize to develop junior faculty. Each tool has a unique goal, time frame and method. It has been suggested that sponsoring may be a particularly useful tool for furthering the careers of women in medicine. Our primary aim was to understand to what extent one group of academic leaders-family medicine department chairs-have benefited from each tool in their own career development and how often they use each to develop others. A secondary aim was to compare women's experiences with sponsorship to their male colleagues. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We surveyed all US family medicine department chairs electronically about their experiences with coaching, mentoring, and sponsoring. We collected data from August 2019 to October 2019. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): One hundred five of 193 family medicine department chairs responded to our survey (54.4% response rate). Most indicated that mentoring played a significant role in their career development, with fewer reporting coaching and sponsorship played significant roles. More reported frequent use of mentoring to develop faculty compared to coaching or sponsoring. Training in mentoring and sponsoring was associated with increased use, but coaching was not. No gender difference was found in this study population. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Chairs have less experience with coaching and sponsoring than mentoring. Personal experience being coached, mentored, or sponsored was associated with increased use of these tools. Formal training may increase use of mentoring and sponsoring.

Assessing factors for choosing a primary care specialty in medical students; A longitudinal study,McDonald C.; ; Henderson A.; Barlow P.; Keith J.,"A shortage of primary care physicians exists in the US, and medical schools are investigating factors that influence specialty choice. To better understand the factors associated with medical students choosing primary care specialties, a longitudinal annual survey from 2013 to 2019 was administered to students at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, starting pre-matriculation. A logistic regression model examined factors of interest. Matching into a primary care specialty (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics) for residency was the primary outcome. Our study compared factors students reported in annual surveys: demographics, mentorship, debt, and lifestyle. Factors significantly associated with primary care specialty included pre-medical and medical school research, a family member in primary care, student age and gender. 28% of men chose primary care, and 47% of women. Although there was no gender difference in rates of medical education debt (N = 286,chi2(1) = 0.28, p = 0.60), men were more likely to report being influenced by debt (N = 278, chi2(1) = 10.88, p = 0.001), and students who reported debt-influenced specialty choice were one-third as likely to enter primary care (N = 189, 95% CI [0.11-1.06], p = 0.06). For men, potential salary was negatively associated with entering primary care (p = 0.03). Women were more likely to have a mentor in primary care (N = 374, chi2(1) = 13.87, p < 0.001), but this was not associated with an increased likelihood of entering primary care for men or women. Having a family member who practices primary care was associated with a 2.87 times likelihood of entering primary care (N = 303, 95% CI [1.14-7.19], p = 0.03).

Female mentors positively contribute to undergraduate STEM research experiences,Moghe S.; ; Baumgart K.; Shaffer J.J.; Carlson K.A.,"The positive influence of undergraduate research and mentoring on student success in STEM fields has been well-established. However, the role that the gender of a research mentor may play in the undergraduate research experience warrants further investigation. This is an especially critical issue to address, since the lack of female role models in STEM fields is acknowledged as an impediment to the success and progress of women pursuing STEM-careers. To evaluate how the gender of undergraduate research mentors influences the research experience of students, we collected and analyzed surveys from undergraduates and alumni who had completed undergraduate research at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. We found that even though students did not select mentors based on gender, there were differences in how students perceived their mentors, depending on the gender of their mentors. Interestingly, students with female mentors were more likely than students with male mentors to report that their research experience had prepared them for a career in science. Further, our gender-pairing analyses revealed that students who expressed that the gender of their mentor had contributed to their relationship with their mentor were more likely to have a female mentor. Our data indicate that female mentors favorably influence the undergraduate research experience of both male and female students. Finally, our study reinforces the conclusions of previous studies demonstrating that undergraduate research and mentoring are beneficial for students. Overall, our findings support that, for students to fully benefit from their undergraduate research experience, undergraduate research opportunities for students should include an equitable representation of female mentors.<ovid:br/>Copyright: &#xa9; 2021 Moghe et al.

Uniformed Services University Medical Student Mentorship Experiences and Gender From 2010 to 2017,Latham K.; ; Dong T.; Schreiber D.; Torre D.; Durning S.; Battista A.,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparity in medicine has drawn increased attention in the form of root cause analysis and programmatic solutions with the goal of equity. Research indicates that mentoring, guidance, and support, which include the provision of social and academic guidance and support from more experienced practitioners, can mitigate challenges associated with gender disparity. The purpose of this study was to explore women medical students' self-reports of mentorship during their time at Uniformed Services University (USU), if women report similar levels of mentorship as compared to men, and if levels of characteristics associated with mentoring (eg, social support, academic guidance) changed over time. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Using data from the American Association of Medical College's Graduate Questionnaire, a survey sent to all medical students prior to graduation, items were coded as related to mentorship, guidance, and support and analyzed to compare responses of female and male students from graduating USU classes of 2010-2017. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): No significant difference was found between experiences of female and male survey respondents. Equitable experiences were consistent across time for the 8 years of the study. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Although mentorship is cited as a key factor in mediating gender disparity in medicine, other STEM fields, and the military, the findings suggest that there is equity at the USU undergraduate medical education level. Further studies are needed to understand if disparities in mentorship experiences occur at other stages of a military physician's career, such as graduate medical education, faculty and academic promotion levels.<ovid:br/>Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2020.

Recruitment in Surgery and Interventional Radiology: Factors in Female Trainees' Specialty Decisions,Matsumoto M.M.; ; Schultz O.; Jiang T.; Navuluri R.,"Objective: This study aims to identify factors influencing female medical students' decision-making about specialties, specifically surgery and interventional radiology (IR), in an effort to inform future recruitment and professional development strategies. <ovid:br/>Design(s): An electronic survey was created to assess both qualitative and quantitative data. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): The survey was sent prior to a symposium for trainees interested in pursuing IR or surgery, held at University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) in February 2019. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): The 90 female trainees who registered were sent the survey, and 48 (53%) responded voluntarily. <ovid:br/>Result(s): All respondents were female, 46% planned to pursue surgery or IR. Students pursuing surgery/IR were less concerned about being valued by their colleagues (p = 0.0073), being in charge of patients' lives (p = 0.0017), radiation exposure (p = 0.0171), chemical exposure (p = 0.0223), emotional stress (p = 0.0244), or shift work (p = 0.0045), compared to the nonsurgery/IR students. No differences were found in ranking of motivating factors, personal strengths or weaknesses, deciding factors, areas for seeking mentorship, or gender diversity. Top motivations among all respondents were intellectual rigor of medicine and becoming a mentor, while concerns were personal physical health, managing a career, pay equity, and gender-based biases. Students most often sought mentors and clerkship experience for making specialty decisions. They reported greatest strengths in empathy and resilience, and weaknesses in negotiating and public speaking. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female medical students planning to pursue surgery/IR expressed greater confidence in their contributions to patient care and lower concerns about workplace hazards. Regardless of specialty intent, female students shared scholarship motivations for a career in medicine, valued the role of mentorship, and expressed persistent concerns about gender discrimination, personal health, and skills-based weaknesses. Identifying factors influential in career decision-making is important in order to recruit and retain a more gender-diverse physician workforce.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery",2020,/,Journal of Surgical Education,77,6,1454EP  - 1464,2006803141,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.06.002,32571694,#155,Matsumoto 2020,"",""
Women in radiology: gender diversity is not a metric-it is a tool for excellence,Kubik-Huch R.A.; ; Vilgrain V.; Krestin G.P.; Reiser M.F.; Attenberger U.I.; Muellner A.U.; Hess C.P.; Hricak H.,"Abstract: Women in Focus: Be Inspired was a unique programme held at the 2019 European Congress of Radiology that was structured to address a range of topics related to gender and healthcare, including leadership, mentoring and the generational progression of women in medicine. In most countries, women constitute substantially fewer than half of radiologists in academia or private practice despite frequently accounting for at least half of medical school enrolees. Furthermore, the proportion of women decreases at higher academic ranks and levels of leadership, a phenomenon which has been referred to as a ""leaky pipeline"". Gender diversity in the radiologic workplace, including in academic and leadership positions, is important for the present and future success of the field. It is a tool for excellence that helps to optimize patient care and research; moreover, it is essential to overcome the current shortage of radiologists. This article reviews the current state of gender diversity in academic and leadership positions in radiology internationally and explores a wide range of potential reasons for gender disparities, including the lack of role models and mentorship, unconscious bias and generational changes in attitudes about the desirability of leadership positions. Strategies for both individuals and institutions to proactively increase the representation of women in academic and leadership positions are suggested. Key Points: * Gender-diverse teams perform better. Thus, gender diversity throughout the radiologic workplace, including in leadership positions, is important for the current and future success of the field. * Though women now make up roughly half of medical students, they remain underrepresented among radiology trainees, faculty and leaders. * Factors leading to the gender gap in academia and leadership positions in Radiology include a lack of role models and mentors, unconscious biases, other societal barriers and generational changes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, The Author(s).",2020,/,European Radiology,30,3,1644EP  - 1652,2003820957,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06493-1,31802213,#156,Kubik-Huch 2020,"",""
Gender sensitivity in career mentoring - a project report from the Medical Faculty of Leipzig University,Gaida P.; ; Kujumdshiev S.; Stengler K.,"Objective: The elective subject ""career management for medical students"" is presented as an example of teaching gender sensitivity issues among medical studies at Leipzig University.

Contract Negotiation Skills: A Workshop for Women in Medicine,Simone A.M.; ; Simone M.; Block L.; LaVine N.,"Introduction: Contract negotiation is a high-stakes interaction, yet most physicians are never taught negotiation skills. Studies suggest that women, as compared with men, display a lower propensity to initiate negotiations and negotiate less competitively, highlighting a need for training to help level the playing field for female physicians. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We devised a learner-centered workshop for female physicians that included a mini-didactic on negotiation principles, a question-and-answer time with a lawyer, an interactive role-play on contract negotiation style, and guided reflection. The workshop was intended for women in medicine from the level of medical student to full professor. The workshop was evaluated by pre- and postworkshop surveys with quantitative questions assessing perceived comfort with and knowledge of negotiation skills and strategies, as well as qualitative questions assessing lessons learned and areas for improvement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After the workshop, participants (n = 34) reported significantly improved comfort with contract negotiation (p < .01) and with negotiation skills and strategies (p < .01). Through qualitative evaluation, we discovered that participants gained an appreciation for the self-advocacy in negotiation, as well as a better understanding of negotiation logistics. We also received positive feedback from participant comments, with most learners reporting that the topic was useful and worthwhile. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): We believe that this workshop fills a gap in the literature regarding contract negotiation training for physicians while also helping to level the playing field with regard to female physicians and the gender pay gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Simone et al.",2020,/,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,16,"(Simone) General Internal Medicine Fellow, Department of Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell; Physician, Internal Medicine, Allina Health(Simone) Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral",10910,632333384,https://dx.doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10910,32656331,#158,Simone 2020,"",""

#Shemergency: Use of a Professional Development Group to Promote Female Resident Recruitment and Retention,Khatri U.G.; ; Love J.; Zeidan A.; Hsu C.H.; Mills A.M.,"PROBLEM: Gender inequity in academic medicine is a pervasive challenge. Recommendations have been implemented to reduce inequities for female faculty. However, there are no well-established guidelines for the recruitment and retention of female residents. APPROACH: To address challenges faced by female physicians and support the recruitment and retention of female residents, female emergency medicine residents and attending physicians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania formed a professional development group (PDG), #Shemergency, in July 2017. From July 2017 to July 2018, this PDG developed events and initiatives for female residents that addressed methods to improve awareness of and develop skills relevant to well-described gender disparities in mentorship, speakership and conference representation, compensation, evaluations, wellness and service, and award recognition. <ovid:br/>OUTCOME(S): Over its first year (July 2017-July 2018), the PDG created a professional community and enhanced mentorship through a number of events and initiatives. The PDG secured funding for 5 residents to attend a national conference and nominated 5 residents and 2 attending physicians for professional organization awards (4 nominees won). NEXT STEPS: After the first year, the PDG expanded the number of joint activities with both male and female colleagues and organized a citywide event for female residents and faculty representing 5 different residency programs. Future work will focus on sustainability (e.g., holding fundraising events), generalizability (e.g., expanding the gender-disparity areas addressed as well as spreading the model to other programs), developing additional events and initiatives (e.g., expanding the number of joint activities with male colleagues), and outcome assessments (e.g., distributing pre- and postevent surveys).",2020,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,95,2,216EP  - 220,629175052,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000002969,31464733,#161,Khatri 2020,"",""
The Influence of Mentors in Orthopedic Surgery,Brook E.M.; ; Hu C.H.; Li X.; Smith E.L.; Matzkin E.G.,"The importance of mentorship in medicine has been established. However, little is known regarding the influence of mentors in orthopedic surgery. This study sought to (1) determine the prevalence of mentoring relationships in orthopedic surgery, (2) assess the influence of mentors in specialty and subspecialty selection, and (3) evaluate the importance of gender in orthopedic mentoring relationships. An electronic survey was distributed to 358 orthopedic surgeons at academic residency programs. Participants were asked to report mentoring relationships and their attitudes toward mentors, including gender preferences. A total of 117 (95 males and 22 females) surveys were returned. The majority of respondents (66.7%, n=78) had at least one mentor in their career, and the majority of respondents (66.7%, n=52) were satisfied with their mentoring experience. Residency was the most common time to have a mentor, and 73.3% (n=44) of respondents indicated their mentor was influential in determining their subspecialty. Although only 50% of respondents indicated they had a mentor in medical school, 84.2% (n=32) believed their mentor was influential in selecting an orthopedic surgery residency. The majority (79.4%, n=62) of respondents did not have a preference on the gender of their mentor. Many orthopedic surgeons have a mentor at some point in their career who influenced their specialty or subspecialty decision. Mentoring experiences are less prevalent in medical school, and female medical students may lack accessibility to mentoring opportunities. Future efforts should focus on opportunities that connect medical students to orthopedic surgery faculty to further diversify the field and close the gender gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; SLACK INCORPORATED.",2020,/,Orthopedics,43,1,37EP  - 42,2025781276,https://dx.doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20191122-02,31770444,#162,Brook 2020,"",""
Retention of women in academic medicine and effects of mentorship,Onumah C.; ; Cioletti A.; Wikstrom S.,"BACKGROUND: Despite entering medical school and academic medicine at higher rates, rates of women faculty are not commensurate with men. Literature has shown that women leave or intend to leave academic medicine for multiple reasons. Gender leadership gaps in academic medicine are well documented in the literature more-so than gender gaps in retention. Lack of women in leadership roles equates to lack of female role models and potential losses related to organizational effectiveness given the importance of diversity within teams and organizations. To address the gender gaps in leadership in academic medicine, we must address the leaky pipeline. The goal of the study is to provide descriptive information regarding relationships between specific institutional factors and interventions and women's intent to remain in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): To better identify what factors are associated with women's retention or intent to remain in academic medicine, we surveyed women faculty with appointments in U.S. Departments of Medicine. The survey consisted of a series of questions rated on a Likert scale, demographic questions, and qualitative write- in questions derived from the literature. Participants voluntarily completed the survey by links posted on public listservs. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), descriptive and discriminant analyses were performed. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): At the close of the survey, 429 survey responses analyzed after removing incomplete surveys and respondents that that did not meet inclusion criteria. The sample included women faculty across all ranks, across all regions, and various ethnicities. The largest number of responses were from women in general internal medicine. Of the participants, 43% were satisfied with the current level of mentorship provided at their institution. More participants agreed if there was a formal mentorship program at their institution, but rates were lower if it was through an outside program or formal peer mentorship. Institutional interventions to address gender inequities varied. A number of factors were found to have a positive association with intention to remain in academic medicine including opportunities to integrate work and life identities, flexible work options, paid parental leave, and professional development. Over 80% of women responding plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While gender bias training for leaders and committee members and faculty development programs may be important steps in addressing gender inequities in academic medicine, these initiatives alone are unlikely to fix the leaky pipeline. Despite the lower rates of women climbing the leadership ladder, most are satisfied with their current opportunities of formal mentorship and plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years. Limitations of this study include selection bias as those opting to take the survey may be more engaged and proactive in seeking mentorship and retention in medicine.",2020,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,35,SUPPL 1,S258EP  - S259,633957537,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-05890-3,,#163,Onumah 2020,"",""
Gender equity: how do the forensic sciences fare?,Ward J.; ; Johnson R.N.; Wilson-Wilde L.,"Females are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at all levels of society. Fewer females are completing STEM school subjects, graduating with STEM degrees, being employed as STEM professionals, and holding senior leadership and academic positions in STEM. However, unlike almost every other STEM discipline, the overall ratio of females is higher in many forensic science disciplines. For our sector, rather than having difficulty in attracting females, the bigger issue is how we retain and promote female talent. This complex issue is exacerbated by: gender pay gaps; family role expectations; lack of visible role models or mentors; discrimination and harassment; and bias during recruitment and promotion practices. We discuss barriers relevant for women in the forensic industry and offer potential solutions. These include flexible work arrangements, sponsorship programmes, and fostering and practising an inclusive workplace culture. Gender equity programmes and exemplar STEM organizations focused on a commitment to gender parity will be explored. Harnessing untapped female talent is as much a social justice issue as employing best practices for improving the quality, diversity and output of our forensic science workforce, and research and innovation strategies.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; 2019, &#xa9; Crown Copyright in the Commonwealth of Australia 2019.

Results of the British Society of Gastroenterology supporting women in gastroenterology mentoring scheme pilot,Smith K.H.; ; Hallett R.J.; Wilkinson-Smith V.; Neild P.J.; Brooks A.J.; Lockett M.J.; Thomas-Gibson S.; Eaden J.A.; Edwards C.,"Introduction Mentorship has long been recognised as beneficial in the business world and has more recently been endorsed by medical and academic professional bodies. Recruitment of women into gastroenterology and leadership roles has traditionally been difficult. The Supporting Women in Gastroenterology network developed this pilot scheme for female gastroenterologists 5 years either side of the Completion Certificate of Specialist Training (CCST) to examine the role that mentorship could play in improving this discrepancy. Method Female gastroenterology trainees and consultant gastroenterologists within 5 years either side of CCST were invited to participate as mentees. Consultant gastroenterologists of both genders were invited to become mentors. 35 pairs of mentor:mentees were matched and completed the scheme over 1 year. Training was provided. Results The majority of the mentees found the sessions useful (82%) and enjoyable (77%), with the benefit of having time and space to discuss professional or personal challenges with a gastroenterologist who is not a colleague. In the longitudinal study of job satisfaction, work engagement, burnout, resilience, self-efficacy, self-compassion and work-life balance, burnout scale showed a small but non significant improvement over the year (probably an effect of small sample size). Personal accomplishment improved significantly. The main challenges were geography, available time to meet and pair matching. The majority of mentors surveyed found the scheme effective, satisfying, mutually beneficial (70%) and enjoyable (78%). Conclusion Mentorship is shown to be beneficial despite the challenges and is likely to improve the recruitment and retention of women into gastroenterology and leadership roles, but is likely to benefit gastroenterologists of both genders.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Author(s).

Dissecting disparity: Improvements towards gender parity in leadership and on the podium within the Canadian Orthopaedic Association,Hiemstra L.A.; ; Wittman T.; Mulpuri K.; Vezina C.; Kerslake S.,"Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to analyse the 15-year trend of women in leadership roles within the Canadian Orthopaedic Association (COA). This included not only leadership positions at the committee level in the association but also the more visible podium positions in the annual meeting programme: research podium and poster presentations, session moderators, panellists and faculty. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data on the numbers of male and female members were gathered from COA membership records for the most recent 5 years (2014-2018), as well as for 10 years previous (2009) and 15 years previous (2004). Male and female representation on COA committees, as well as the number of presenters at the annual meeting was calculated. Descriptive data were generated to compare the changes in gender representation over time. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In Canada, in 2018, 11.2% of orthopaedic surgeons were female. Within the COA, 17.6% of the members are female, with active female surgeons comprising 11.6% of the total membership.

"Scholarly Collaboration, Mentorship, and Friendship: A New Model for Success in Academic Medicine",Abramson E.L.; ; Naifeh M.M.; Stevenson M.D.; Li S.-T.T.,"Mentorship can be one of the most important factors in helping faculty members successfully advance academic careers. Finding effective mentorship, however, is extremely challenging and lack of mentorship may negatively impact productivity, promotion, and retention. Women, in particular, identify lack of mentorship as a major factor inhibiting career advancement, which in turn may be one element contributing to the significant gender gaps existing in academic medicine. Here, we describe a model of mentoring drawn from our personal experiences as 4 female faculty that has resulted in a successful collaboration spanning nearly a decade. This model combines different elements of mentoring models previously described in the literature into a single model of network mentoring. Our model aims to promote longitudinal, collaborative scholarship around a broad common research theme, provide long-term mentorship focused on successfully navigating personal and academic hurdles, and create a forum of mentorship for faculty at all academic ranks. Keys to the success of our model, The Accelerate Scholarship through Personal Engagement with a Collaborative Team (ASPECT) Model, are: 1) a shared overarching research goal that allows for multiple projects to be worked on over time; 2) regular, structured meetings; 3) a collaborative yet flexible arrangement with ""group accountability""; and 4) a focus on the human connection.

Men students felt comfortable with mentors who provided limited guidance, little psychosocial mentoring, and opportunities for informal interactions. In terms of peer relationships, women sought out the confidence of a few similar peers, while men were comfortable with a wide variety of peers.

Demographics of codes were compared by using chi-square analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Male faculty identified barriers that included negative views of leadership or leaders. Female faculty, especially those in clinical roles, expressed barriers related to role overload, including that the demands of their current positions prevented advancement or addition of further roles, no matter how desirable further roles may be. Women also shared that considerable self-promotion was required to receive acknowledgement of their work and support by leadership. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A proposed framework depicts male and female faculty's concerns on a continuum. No Obstacle and Process Concerns were relatively gender neutral, whereas large gender disparities occurred within the Barriers to Success theme. Women's barriers largely revolved around internal obstacles (I can't do any more), and men's barriers largely revolved around external factors (leaders are impeding my progress). Resources are needed to mitigate work overload specifically for female faculty, and to ensure that all faculty are both engaged in advanced career opportunities and encouraged to pursue leadership positions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2019,/,Journal of Women's Health,28,3,393EP  - 402,626825459,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2018.7252,30481114,#172,Ellinas 2019,"",""
Women in medicine mentoring and empowerment training program: A needs assessment and intervention in progress,Simone A.; ; Simone M.; Block L.; LaVine N.A.,"Needs and Objectives: Women face unique challenges throughout their careers as physicians, including disparities in salary and leadership positions. Interventions to address these issues have been made at the faculty level, however little has been done to address the same challenges for female residents. This is concerning, as many decisions determining career trajectory take place during residency. Thus, we conducted a needs assessment on gender in the workplace to establish a mentoring and empowerment training program to support female residents. Setting and Participants: A needs assessment survey was distributed amongst female internal medicine residents within the Northwell Health System. There residents were also the participants in our focus group and ongoing training program. Description: A targeted needs assessment, a combination of 3 validated surveys on workplace/gender culture, burnout and empowerment was sent to female residents. Surveys were sent to 60 female residents, and to date we have a 30% response rate. Preliminary Results show that 69% of respondents felt that women had fewer opportunities for professional development at work than men, 69% felt that men receive more organizational support than women, and 87% stated they would like to receive more support in the workplace. Data collection still is ongoing. These early Results reveal an opportunity to provide support and professional development to our female trainees. A focus group of five female trainees identified a need for a ""safe-space"" to discuss issues specific to being female residents. Participants identified desired topics, including negotiation, leading an effective team, work-life integration, public speaking, self-advocacy and addressing microaggressions and gender bias in the workplace. Based on this preliminary data, we developed a 6-session mentoring and empowerment training program for female internal medicine residents. Each session includes a learner-centered workshop on a topic from the focus group, and time for mentoring. Sessions are held at the hospital after working hours for ease of attendance. Evaluation: Three workshops have been held, with attendance ranging from 5-15 participants. Pre-and post-workshop surveys focused on perceived knowledge and comfort with topics covered will be given at each session, the Results of which are forthcoming. The needs assessment survey will be repeated at the end of the year to reassess participant's sense of support and opportunity for career advancement. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Our needs assessment shows a need amongst female residents for a place to receive support and career training. Our program provides a learner-centered, innovative way to provide this. Variability in attendance is attributed to variable resident schedules, and we plan to optimize schedules to enhance attendance going forward.",2019,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,34,2 Supplement,S865EP  - S866,629002932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11606.1525-1497,,#173,Simone 2019,"",""
Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Academically Productive Surgeons Mentor Dental Students,Jazayeri H.E.; ; Ganjawalla K.P.; Lee K.C.; Wu B.W.; Tannyhill R.J.,"Purpose: A mentor in academic surgery encompasses a supportive and supervisory role in a trainee's development during residency training, both in clinical and academic capacities, while the trainee often is tasked with seeking the mentor and being proactive in making the most out of their relationship (1, 2). However, the academic productivity of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) mentors sought by trainees is poorly understood. As such, the purpose of this study is to determine if a significant relationship exists between the involvement of trainees in research studies and the academic productivity (h-index) of the research mentor. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): To address the research question, the authors designed and implemented a retrospective cohort study. The study population was comprised of JOMS publications from January 2002 through December 2016. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that provided author affiliations and academic ranks. Studies with contributions from foreign institutions, private practices, and military organizations were excluded. The Scopus database was used to identify the h-index of the mentor at the year of the publication. The ScienceDirect database was used to query author affiliations. The primary predictor variable was the presence or absence of a trainee author. A trainee in this study was defined as an OMS resident or dental student. Secondary predictor variables included the year of publication, study topic, and study design. The primary outcome variable was the academic productivity, measured by h-index, of the study mentor. A mentor in this study was represented by the corresponding author. Descriptive statistics were calculated and stratified by trainee groups. T-tests were performed to compare the h-index of mentors of studies with or without trainees for each study topic and design using SPSS. Results and Outcomes: Of the 6398 articles that were published in JOMS from January 2002 to December 2016, 1341 met the inclusion criteria (21%). The mean h-index of the senior author from our sample was 19.2 14.4. In the cohort without trainees, the mean h-index was 18.8 14.3. The relationship between trainee contribution to a study and the h-index, or academic productivity, of the mentor was insignificant (P =.50). The mean h-index of the mentor on publications that included dental students was 23.0 14.7, which was greater than the mean h-index of 18.7 14.2 in studies without a dental student, indicating a strong statistical correlation (P <.005). The mean h-index of these articles was 18.9 14.4, while the mean h-index with no OMS residents was 19.6 14.3, with no statistically significant relationship between resident contribution and mentor h-index (P =.37). Regarding the secondary predictor variables, there was a significant relationship between the h-index and both study topic (P <.01) and study design (P <.05). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest an important relationship between the academic productivity of the research mentor and the contribution of dental students in scientific manuscripts published in JOMS. This mentor-mentee relationship appears to be beneficial for both parties: the mentored student ideally gains insight into the specialty, the scientific method, and research methodology, and the participating oral and maxillofacial surgeon benefits through increased academic productivity. Future studies might investigate avenues to encourage and strengthen these mentor-mentee relationships. Additionally, a better understanding of how to facilitate and improve these relationships may act as a tool to help address the disparity in gender and minority representation within our specialty.

Eliminating Institutional Barriers to Career Advancement for Diverse Faculty in Academic Surgery,Newman E.A.; ; Waljee J.; Dimick J.B.; Mulholland M.W.,"There is critical need to address achievement barriers in Academic Medicine. Although opportunities for professional development of women and underrepresented minority physician scientists are growing, academic promotion rates remain historically low. Moreover, underrepresented groups are not likely to advance to decanal and leadership positions. To eliminate institutional barriers to achievement for diverse faculty, strategies to strengthen environment, recruitment, professional development, and leadership were implemented.

Assessing Mentorship Experiences of Faculty at a Military Academic Center: Challenge and Opportunity,McMains K.C.; ; Rodriguez R.G.; Peel J.; Yun H.C.; True M.W.; Jones W.S.,"Objectives Mentor relationships are a key component of professional development within academic medicine. To date, there are no investigations into the prevalence and effects of mentor relationships within military academic medicine. This quality improvement initiative aimed to establish the prevalence and effects of mentorship, including whether sex differences exist among faculty at a military academic center, the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, and identify opportunities to improve faculty development efforts for mentorship to benefit faculty at this institution. Methods A 17-item survey was developed using an iterative process. Using the SurveyMonkey platform, the survey was distributed to each faculty member within the 33 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited programs. Results A total of 104 responses (26%) were received from 393 total faculty members, including 48 Air Force, 45 Army, 3 Navy, and 8 Contractor/Government Service respondents. Thirty-four respondents were women (33%) and 70 were men (67%). Only 42% of faculty reported currently having a mentor. Thirty-nine respondents (38%; 44% men and 27% women) received formal mentorship at their first staff physician position after residency training. Mentorship helped respondents the most in the areas of clinical skills, understanding departmental/institutional culture, professionalism/officership, academic promotion/advancement, and clarification of priorities/goals. When asked whether more effective mentorship would affect their own decision to remain on active-duty military service, 14% responded ""yes"" and 28% responded ""possibly."" Conclusions Increased mentorship has the potential to positively affect career development in military academic military medicine. Results from this study affirm previous reports that effective mentorship potentially represents a powerful tool for faculty retention.

Rationale and Models for Career Advancement Sponsorship in Academic Medicine: The Time Is Here; the Time Is Now,Gottlieb A.S.; ; Travis E.L.,"The business community has honed the concept of sponsorship and promulgated its utility for harnessing the talent of high-performing women and minorities whose contributions often go unrecognized within organizations. In recent years, academic medicine has begun to do the same. Whereas mentorship often centers on personal and professional development (e.g., skill building and goal setting), sponsorship focuses on enhancing the visibility, credibility, and professional networks of talented individuals. For upward career mobility, mentorship is limited in scope. Sponsorship, on the other hand, directly targets career advancement and is anchored in the sponsor's awareness of organizational structures and critical professional opportunities for junior faculty. Men are more likely to garner sponsors informally, and these sponsors tend to be male. Existing disparities between male and female medical faculty in achievement of academic rank and leadership roles, compensation, and research support suggest that high-performing women have a visibility gap. Such systemic inequity reflects a suboptimal business model that limits organizational potential. Formal sponsorship programs that match women with senior leaders facilitate access to beneficial relationships and institutionalize the value of equal opportunity. In this Perspective, the authors describe two successful sponsorship models that exist within academic medicine, the Society of General Internal Medicine's Career Advising Program and MD Anderson Cancer Center's Leaders' Sponsorship Program. They issue a call to action for much broader implementation of sponsorship programming to cultivate the advancement of all talented medical faculty and provide recommendations for such endeavors.",2018,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,93,11,1620EP  - 1623,624696276,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000002342,29979207,#177,Gottlieb 2018,"",""
Sex Differences in Faculty Rank Among Academic Surgeons in the United States in 2014,Blumenthal D.M.; ; Bergmark R.W.; Raol N.; Bohnen J.D.; Eloy J.A.; Gray S.T.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate sex differences in full professorship among a comprehensive, contemporary cohort of US academic surgeons. Summary of Background Data: Previous work demonstrates that women are less likely than men to be full professors in academic medicine, and in certain surgical subspecialties. Whether sex differences in academic rank exist across all surgical fields, and after adjustment for confounders, is not known. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A comprehensive list of surgeons with faculty appointments at US medical schools in 2014 was obtained from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) faculty roster and linked to a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, an online physician networking website, which contained the following data for all physicians: sex, age, years since residency, publication number (total and first/last author), clinical trials participation, National Institutes of Health grants, and surgical subspecialty. A 20% sample of 2013 Medicare payments for care was added to this dataset. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate sex differences in full professorship, adjusting for these variables and medical school-specific fixed effects. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among 11,549 surgeon faculty at US medical schools in 2014, 1692 (14.7%) were women. Women comprised 19.4% of assistant professors (1072/5538), 13.8% of associate professors (404/2931), and 7.0% of full professors (216/3080).

Creation of a successful professional development program for women in a major medical school pathology department,Gronowski A.; ; Burnham C.D.,"Introduction: According to 2015 AAMC data, the percentage of full professor faculty who are women in US medical schools is 22% and the percent full professor women within pathology departments is 26%. To improve promotion and retention of women in pathology, professional development for faculty and trainees at major medical schools is important. The percentage of women faculty at the full professor level at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is below AAMC average at 19% and within Pathology is 13%. Hence, professional development for women within the Pathology Department of WUSM is particularly important. Goals: Our goal was to create a women's professional development program within the Department of Pathology at Washington University School of Medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The 'Women of AP/CP', a forum for women faculty, residents, and fellows was created in November 2012. The forum meets at the University from 4: 00-5: 00 once per month and includes various topics, articles, books and invited speakers that cover a broad range of professional development subjects. After five years of activity, the success of the forum was assessed by surveying past attendees. A survey was created using Surveymonkey.com and sent to 65 women who had been invited to the forum over the five year period. Responses were received from 26/65 (40%) of women surveyed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Junior faculty constituted 42% of attendees, with fellows (35%), residents (27%), mid-career (23%) and senior faculty (4%) attending in descending frequency. 100% of responders indicated that they found the content valuable to their professional development. Virtually all attendees agreed that including both faculty and trainees enhanced their experience, with only one faculty indicating they felt inclusion of trainees diminished the experience. 95% of respondents found the time of day for the program (4 to 5 pm) to be appropriate. The content topics rated as most useful were 'Increased awareness of issues facing women in science' (95%), 'Increased knowledge of faculty development programs and resources' (89%) and 'Increased awareness of unconscious bias' (74%). A panel discussion with high profile successful women was the highest rated guest speaker event. 'Career development strategies' was the highest rated topic covered. 'Women Don't Ask' and 'Ask for It' by Linda Babcock & Sara Laschever were tied for the highest rated books reviewed, and 'Speaking out about gender imbalance in invited speakers improves diversity' (Klein R et al. Nature Immunology 2016;18: 475-77) was the highest rated article covered in the forum. A session on promotion by the department chairman was rated highly. Questions such as 'most valuable session' and 'suggestions for future sessions' were also addressed. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Here we describe the formation of a successful professional development program for women within a pathology department at a major medical school. The most valuable topics covered in this forum included unconscious bias and negotiation skills for women. This format could easily be replicated in any academic department. Knowledge of what topics women found most valuable can help direct the content and enhance successful outcomes of these types of professional development programs.",2018,/,Clinical Chemistry,64,Supplement 1,S191,624175210,,,#179,Gronowski 2018,"",""
Finding mentorship for the skull base trainee,Richardson A.M.; ; Armstrong V.L.; Morcos J.J.,"Background: More than half of medical students are women, but gender disparities continue to exist in neurosurgical and otolaryngology residency programs. This difference is more pronounced in neurosurgery, where women have lower entry rates and higher attrition rates compared with males (17 vs. 5.3%). A lack of role models and mentorship has been identified as barriers to success by female trainees in academic medicine. Some studies suggest that female trainees may benefit from female role models and/or mentors, while others contend that gender is irrelevant. Skull base pathology requires an interdisciplinary approach usually requiring input from neuroradiologists, otolaryngologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologist, oncologists, and neurosurgeons. Given the involvement of specialties with higher rates of female participation, we hypothesized that gender differences observed in neurosurgery would be less pronounced in the interdisciplinary skull base field. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was performed to identify the rates of female involvement at various career stages from applying to residency to chairing an academic program. <ovid:br/>Result(s): From 2012 to 2016, 19% of applicants per year to neurosurgical residency programs were female; 31% of applicants per year for otolaryngology. Currently there are nine neurosurgery programs with none female residents (2.9% of programs). The leadership of neurosurgery residency programs is mainly male-three female department chairs (2 interim; 2.8%) and seven female program directors (6.5%). Editorial boards of neurosurgery journals contain few women (JNS 0% female, JNS: Spine 0%, JNS: Pediatrics 17%, combined 5.7% female), with higher rates of women in otolaryngology (JAMA-Otolaryngology 25%, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 35%, Laryngoscope 19.6%, combined 24%). The Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B Skull Base has 8.3% females on the editorial board. Fellowship directors are largely male with only one female listed as a codirector of a neurosurgery fellowship while ENT has two females listed. The North American Skull Base Society (NASBS) annual meeting has female participation on the Scientific Program Committee, but sparse female representation on the Executive Committee, Directors at Large, and Board of Advisors (1 female in any of these roles over 2 years compared with 41 males). In 2016, women composed 9.6% of faculty and in 2017, 15.5% were female. Although female participation is increasing at multiple levels, the ranks of the ""master surgeons"" who speak at the NASBS national meeting are almost all male (1 female, 60 males with 2016 and 2017 participants combined). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): As compared with otolaryngology, neurosurgery has fewer females applying to residency, completing training, acting in leadership positions, and participating on editorial boards. More women are entering these fields than in the past and as this generation of surgeons finishes training, we will likely see an increase in female leadership. For women currently in training, an interdisciplinary field such as skull base surgery with comparatively higher rates of female participation, particularly at national meetings, provides trainees with networking opportunities and the identification of female mentors/role models even if they are of a different specialty.",2018,/,"Journal of Neurological Surgery, Part B: Skull Base",79,Supplement 1,,621380716,https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1633614,,#180,Richardson 2018,"",""

We carried out a cluster-randomized, multifaceted intervention to improve the success of women assistant professors at a research-intensive medical school. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-seven departments/divisions were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The three-tiered intervention included components that were aimed at (1) the professional development of women assistant professors, (2) changes at the department/division level through faculty-led task forces, and (3) engagement of institutional leaders. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between assignment and outcomes, adjusting for correlations induced by the clustered design. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Academic productivity and work self-efficacy improved significantly over the 3-year trial in both intervention and control groups, but the improvements did not differ between the groups. Average hours worked per week declined significantly more for faculty in the intervention group as compared with the control group (-3.82 vs. -1.39 hours, respectively, p = 0.006). The PhD faculty in the intervention group published significantly more than PhD controls; however, no differences were observed between MDs in the intervention group and MDs in the control group. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Significant improvements in academic productivity and work self-efficacy occurred in both intervention and control groups, potentially due to school-wide intervention effects. A greater decline in work hours in the intervention group despite similar increases in academic productivity may reflect learning to ""work smarter"" or reveal efficiencies brought about as a result of the multifaceted intervention.

Females in academia with the female mentors have a decreased likelihood of promotion: Results from a network analysis of academic generalists,Chaiyachati K.H.; ; Liao J.M.; Weissman G.E.; Hubbard R.; Morgan A.U.; Buehler A.; Shea J.A.; Armstrong K.,"BACKGROUND: While mentorship is critical for academic careers, the association between academic promotion and mentorship attributes is poorly understood. Moreover, we hypothesized that mentor attributes may affect the known gender disparities in promotion. We used network analysis methods to explore the relationship between mentorship and promotion among academic generalists trained in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Through online searches and contacting programs, we identified graduates of generalist-oriented fellowships (e.g., general medicine, RWJ Clinical Scholars Program) between 2002-2007. We manually extracted PubMed publication data and electronically surveyed graduates to obtain information about grants, academic rank, and their top 10 most influential career mentors at the 5-year mark post-fellowship. With respondent mentees and nominated mentors represented as vertices, and mentor relationships as edges, we constructed a generalist community graph and generated 2 network measures: percent of common gender dyads (i.e., gender concordant menteementor pairs) and mentor centrality (i.e., how connected a mentor is to other network mentees). Using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for respondent and training institution characteristics, we evaluated the impact of common gender dyads, mentor centrality, and the interaction between the two on promotion to associate professor or higher, 5 years post-fellowship. We also calculated ""gender assortativity"" for the community graph, a composite measure of mentee preference for the same gender mentors [range: -1 (pref. for opposite-gender) to 1 (pref. for same-gender)]. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In total, 162 graduates representing 19 institutions completed our survey (51% response rate). Among the 136 who remained in academia 5 years post-fellowship, the majority were female (65%) and white (67%). At the 5-year mark, respondents reported a median of 3 mentors (IQR 3-5) and 10 peer reviewed publications (IQR 4-18). Thirty-nine percent reported < $500 K in grants and 13% achieved associate professor or higher. In multivariable analysis, neither gender nor percent of common gender dyads independently predicted promotion. However, the association between common gender dyad and promotion differed formen and women respondents with an odds ratio (OR) of 8.61 for men and 0.06 for women (interaction term p-value = 0.03). Other significant associations with promotion included mentor centrality, publications, and grant dollars. The assortativity of the mentorship graph was 0.11 (p < 0.001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): We identified facets of mentorship that may affect early career promotion. While more work is needed, we found the relationship between promotion and common gender dyads varied by gender-female mentees are less likely to be promoted with more female mentorship compared to males mentees with more male mentorship.

We developed a tool to assess mentoring activities experienced by faculty and evaluated evidence for its validity., METHODS: The National Initiative on Gender, Culture, and Leadership in Medicine-""C-Change""-previously developed the C-Change Faculty Survey to assess the culture of academic medicine. After intensive review, we added six items representing six components of mentoring to the survey-receiving help with career and personal goals, learning skills, sponsorship, and resources. We tested the items in four academic health centers during 2013 to 2014. We estimated reliability of the new items and tested the correlation of the new items with a mentoring composite variable representing faculty mentoring experiences as positive, neutral, or inadequate and with other C-Change dimensions of culture., RESULTS: Among the 1520 responding faculty (response rate 61-63%), there was a positive association between each of the six mentoring activities and satisfaction with both the amount and quality of mentoring received. There was no difference by sex. Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from 0.89 to 0.95 across subgroups of faculty (by sex, race, and principal roles). The mentoring responses were associated most closely with dimensions of Institutional Support (r = 0.58, P < .001), Institutional Change Efforts for Faculty Support (r = 0.52, P < .001), Values Alignment (r = 0.58, P < .001), Self-efficacy (r = 0.43; P < .001), and Relationships/Inclusion/Trust (r = 0.41; P < .001)., DISCUSSION: Data demonstrated that the Mentoring scale is a valid instrument to assess mentoring.

Peer approaches to lupus self-management (PALS): A novel lupus peer mentorship intervention,Williams E.; ; Egede L.; Oates J.,"Background Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronicautoimmune disease that is associated with increased morbidity,mortality, health care costs and decreased quality of life. Whileevidence-based self-management interventions that incorporateboth social support and health education have reduced pain,improved function, and delayed disability among lupus patients,African Americans and women are still disproportionatelyimpacted by lupus. In the United States, African Americans havethree to four times greater prevalence of lupus, risk of developinglupus at an earlier age, and lupus-related disease activity, damage,and mortality compared with Caucasians, with the highest ratesexperienced by African American women. Persistent disparitiesmay be due to the non-responsiveness of existing programs tothe unique needs of African Americans and/or women with lupus.Peer mentoring interventions are effective in other chronic conditions that disproportionately affect minorities, such as diabetes,HIV, and kidney disease, but there is currently no empiricallytested peer mentoring intervention developed for SLE patients.Materials and methods A literature review, needs assessment,and interviews with patients guided the development of a peermentor training manual and a peer mentoring intervention. African American women with lupus are being recruited from theSLE database at the Medical University of South Carolina. Sevenmentors will be trained and paired with 21 mentees to providemodelling and reinforcement to participants by telephone for atleast 60 minutes every week for 12 weeks.

Mentoring in general surgery in Switzerland,Kaderli R.M.; ; Klasen J.M.; Businger A.P.,"BACKGROUND: Mentorship has been found as a key factor for a successful and satisfying career in academic medicine and surgery. The present study was conducted to describe the current situation of mentoring in the surgical community in Switzerland and to evaluate sex differences regarding the impact of mentoring on career success and professional satisfaction., METHODS: The study was designed as an anonymous national survey to all members of the Swiss Surgical Society in 2011 (820 ordinary and 49 junior members). It was a 25-item questionnaire addressing mentor-mentee relationships and their impact on the professional front., RESULTS: Of the 869 mailed surveys, 512 responses were received (response rate: 58.9%). Mentor-mentee relationships were reported by 344 respondents (68.1%) and structured mentoring programs were noted in 23 respondents (6.7%). Compared to individuals without mentors, male mentees exhibited significantly higher subjective career advancement (5.4+/-1.2 vs. 5.0+/-1.3; p=0.03) and career development (3.3+/-1.9 vs. 2.5+/-1.7; p<0.01) scores, but the differences for female mentees were not statistically significant (4.7+/-1.1 vs. 4.3+/-1.2, p=0.16; 2.5+/-1.6 vs. 1.9+/-1.4, p=0.26; respectively). The pursuit of an academic career was not influenced by the presence of a mentor-mentee relationship for female (p=0.14) or male participants (p=0.22)., CONCLUSIONS: Mentor-mentee relationships are important for the career advancement of male surgeons.

Women otolaryngologists representing diverse subspecialties, training, and practice environments were recruited via a purposive criterion-based sampling approach. Semistructured interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed via an inductive-deductive approach to produce a thematic content analysis. Results Among the 12 women interviewees, who represented 7 subspecialties, the majority were Caucasian (58%) and in academic practice (50%). The median residency graduation year was 2002 (range, 1982-2013). Participants expressed several challenges that women otolaryngologists face with respect to negotiation, including the absence of systematic formal negotiation training, gendered expectations that women experience during negotiations, and a perceived lack of power in negotiations. Obstacles to effective sponsorship included difficulty in the identification of sponsors and the influence of gender and related systemic biases that hindered sponsorship opportunities. Conclusion Notable gender disparities exist for negotiation and sponsorship in the midcareer stage for women otolaryngologists.

The Impact of Mentoring on Academic Career Success in Surgical Subspecialties: A Systematic Review,"Case, M; Herrera, M; Rumps, MV; Mulcahey, MK","INTRODUCTION: As of 2019, women comprise 52.4% of medical school matriculants, make up more than onethird of the active physician workforce, and nearly half of residents and fellows. Although the number of women physicians continues to increase, many surgical subspecialities, including orthopaedic surgery, have not seen a substantial increase in the percentage of women physicians. This may be due to a lack of mentorship. Efforts within the medical community to decrease the burden of gender bias on women include attempts to increase access to mentorship opportunities. Effective mentoring is a critical aspect of any resident physician's training. The purpose of this study was to analyze the most important aspects of mentorship in the academic advancement of female surgical subspecialists. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in July 2022 using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database, Scopus, and Web of Science.10 Search terms can be found in Appendix 1. An initial abstract screen of each article was conducted by 3 authors. Studies were included if they focused on mentorship of women in academic surgery, were published from 2000-2023, were peer-reviewed articles in the English language, and conducted in the United States. Two reviewers screened each article based on the criteria; the remaining studies were then reviewed in full text. After the full text screen, the eligible articles underwent data extraction and quality assessment using AXIS tool or CASP checklist. The results were then analyzed and synthesized. Additionally, risk of bias was assessed using the 2018 version of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: Several common themes among the 10 studies were identified. Six (60%) studies discussed the impact of mentorship on career success. One of the most important ways that mentors assist mentees is by serving as positive role models. Two (20%) studies noted that goal-setting assistance is one of the most helpful ways mentors can provide guidance. Guidance with academic politics (such as funding and research priorities) was identified as a major contribution by mentors in two (20%) studies. The second most common theme was female mentors (6; 60%). Most studies (9; 90%) agree that it's important for women surgeons to have female mentors. The importance of multiple mentors was explored in 4 (40%) papers. Three (30%) studies addressed the issue of balancing work and life responsibilities among female surgeons. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that female surgical subspecialists value mentorship in regard to career development, managing work-life balance, and academic productivity. Although many studies found that female physicians were more likely to express the desire for a same-sex mentor, these female subspecialists were also more likely to report not only a lack of mentorship but a lack of available female mentors. Effective mentoring from multiple mentors, preferably some of whom identify as female, may improve career advancement in female surgical subspecialists and promote gender equality in these fields. More research is needed to establish a baseline of knowledge on how mentoring specifically affects quantitative aspects of career development, such as research productivity and promotions, to continue to equilibrate these historically male-dominated subspecialities.",2024,,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,81,12,,WOS:001342713600001,10.1016/j.jsurg.2024.09.011,,#226,Case 2024,"",""
Mentors and Role Models: the Role Female Medical Educators Serve for Female Medical Students,"Christensen, HR; Bognar, ES","Discussion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has moved to the forefront in medical education, and in particular, efforts toward gender equity have emphasized the need for more women faculty and physicians.

Mentoring program: women supporting women,"RuizCantisani, MI; Lara-Prieto, V; García-García, RM; Ortiz, MG; Flores, EGR; Romero-Robles, LE","Gender equity and inclusion have been relevant topics in the agenda of the companies, organizations and universities. As a university and particularly with engineering, science and technology programs, it is relevant to implement actions that encourage this culture of gender equity in a STEM environment. The main initiatives are related to mentoring programs, which seek to develop and empower women through women themselves. The research aims to identify the factors that influence the impact generated by the mentoring process in the different stakeholders: teachers, researchers and high school students. The mentoring model is composed of three key elements: (a) massive session with life testimonies of engineering and science students, (b) massive session with the testimonies of mentors and mentees, and (c) the mentoring sessions in small groups or one-to-one. The methodology is of a mixed nature and is composed of 4 stages: (1)design of the mentoring program based on the research of literature review and interviews with companies that has experience in mentoring programs, (2) implementation of the mentoring program with high school students and women STEM professors mentors, (3) evaluation of the impact of the program with interviews with mentors, observation, focus groups with mentors and mentees, and surveys, (4) definition of the impact factors and improvement areas of the program. The findings in the different stages allowed to integrate the factors that impact the mentoring process and its involved stakeholders. Some of the factors that influence the impact of the mentoring program are: the role of the mentor and its characteristics, the mentee profile, its commitments and interests, the impact of the life testimony both professional and personal, the type of needs that arise for the mentees and for the mentors, the time of attention, and the interaction.",2021,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON),,,558-562,WOS:000689064100082,10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453944,,#229,RuizCantisani 2021,"",""
"Mentoring for women starting a PhD: a ""free zone"" into academic identity","Stroude, A; Bellier-Teichmann, T; Cantero, O; Dasoki, N; Kaeser, L; Ronca, M; Morin, D","Purpose - Despite increasing numbers of women attaining higher levels in academic degrees, gender disparities remain in higher education and among university faculty. Authors have posited that this may stem from inadequate academic identity development of women at the doctoral level. While gender differences may be explained by multiple and variable factors, mentoring has been proposed as a viable means to promote academic identity development and address these gender gaps. A ""StartingDoc program"" was launched and supported by four universities in French-speaking Switzerland. The purpose of this paper is to report the experience of one of the six ""many-to-one"" mentoring groups involved in the StartingDoc program in 2012-2013.Design/methodology/ approach - This study is based on the description of a group experience within a university-based mentoring scheme offered to women entering in their PhD program in French-speaking Switzerland. It is examined using a qualitative, narrative case study design.Findings - Themes from the narrative analysis included the four dimensions of the Clutterbuck model of mentoring ( guiding, coaching, counselling, networking), as well as an additional five emerging themes: first expectations, process, sharing, building identity, and unmet expectations. The qualitative analyses suggest that mentoring can be an effective tool in supporting professional identity development among female doctoral students. However, further work is needed to elucidate the most effective strategies for developing and retaining women in academia.Originality/ value - While a many-to-one mentoring group has been theorized and is recognized as an effective means of supporting doctoral experience, its implementation in French-speaking Switzerland is in its infancy. This study provides insights into the value of such a mentoring scheme dedicated to women at the very beginning of their doctoral studies.

Women mentoring women,"Chang, C; Watt, TMF; Fiedler, AG; Worrell, SG","The year 2017 was monumental for women in medicine. For the first time in history, women comprised more than 50% of medical school matriculates and 41% of general surgery residents.1 Women also made enormous strides in national surgical leadership. Dr Leigh Neumayer became the first female chair of the American College of Surgeons Board of Regents and Dr Diane Farmer became the first fe-male chair of the American College of Surgeons Board of Governors.2 Until 1970, women made up only 6% of any medical school class and 2% of all surgical residents in the United States.3 Currently, 24 women are chairs of de-partments of surgery at academic institutions across the United States (https://www.womensurgeons.org/page/ FemaleSurgeryChairs), including Cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Christine Lau.2 Although the gender gap is narrowing, this is not true across all surgical subspecialties.

Paving the way and passing the torch: mentors' motivation and experience of supporting women in optical engineering,"Kodate, N; Kodate, K; Kodate, T","The phenomenon of women's underrepresentation in engineering is well known. However, the slow progress in achieving better gender equality here compared with other domains has accentuated the 'numbers' issue, while the quality aspects have been largely ignored. This study aims to shed light on both these aspects via the lens of mentors, who are at the coalface of guiding female engineers through their education and subsequent careers. Based on data collected from 25 mentors (8 men and 17 women from 8 countries), the paper explores their experiences of being mentors, as well as their views on recommended actions for nurturing female engineers. The findings reveal that the primary motivation for becoming a mentor was personal for men and women. Many mentors from countries with relatively lower female labour participation rates perceive their roles as guarantors of their mentees' successful future career paths, and a similar trend can be found in mentors in academia.

This qualitative case study sought to better understand mentoring relationships between faculty doctoral mentors and STEM doctoral students. This research emphasizes the role of mentoring as part of an intervening strategy for doctoral retention and suggests culturally responsive mentoring as a means to improve the experiences of PhD underrepresented minority (URM) students. This study addresses a gap in the literature related to culturally responsive mentoring and the STEM disciplines.The findings were developed from four qualitative research focus group interviews. Focus group interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by the research team. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method, an iterative process to extrapolate key words and identify significant patterns [1]. This study uses critical inquiry as a theoretical framework. Our findings revealed that mentoring takes place within a complex environment framed by systems of inequity grounded in race and gender. Three themes were constructed from the data: mentoring as a biased environment, lack of responsiveness to student needs, and relational tensions. This paper briefly examines one theme: mentoring as a biased environment. The data highlight how biased standpoints result in a shift in the learning experience. Bias may be based on race, gender, or age, and may be implicit or explicit. Within this environment doctoral students are challenged to navigate spaces such as classrooms and laboratories that can be wrought with difficulties springing from gender and race.This paper is relevant to mentoring and STEM as it acknowledges that mentoring is a heavily nuanced practice with important cultural implications relative to PhD STEM students and faculty.",2020,,2020 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2020),,,,WOS:000646660800329,,,#255,IEEE 2020,"",""

Thus, recruiting and retaining female surgeons remains an important challenge to meet the need for surgeons and increase the quality of care. The participations were female medical students between their third and fifth academic year. In this study, we applied the well-established psychological theory of planned behavior (TPB) which suggests that the intention to perform a behavior (e.g. pursuing a career in surgery) is the most critical and immediate predictor of performing the behavior. We investigated whether a two-part short-mentoring seminar significantly increases students' intention to pursue a career in a surgical or related specialty after graduation. Method: The mentoring and role-model seminar was conducted at 2 days for 90 minutes by six inspiring female role models with a remarkable career in surgical or related disciplines.

A follow-up survey was administered 12 months later (T2). Results: The mentoring seminar positively impacted female students' attitude towards a career in a surgical specialty. Female students reported a significantly increased positive attitude (p < .001) and significantly higher self-efficacy expectations (p < .001) towards a surgical career after participating in the mentoring seminar. Regarding their career intention after the seminar, female students declared a significantly higher intention to pursue a career in a surgical specialty after graduating (p < .001) and this effect seems to be sustainable after 1 year. Conclusion: For the first time we could show that short-mentoring and demonstrating role models in a seminar surrounding has a significant impact on female medical student decision<acute accent>s to pursue a career in a surgery speciality.

This study investigates factors associated with burnout among highly successful early career physician-researchers in Japan.MethodAmong 1790 physician awardees of Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists by the Japanese Ministry in 2014-2015, 490 participated in this cross-sectional survey in 2016 (usable response rate 23.8%). The primary outcome was psychological burnout, measured by the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (i.e., personal burnout, work-related burnout, and patient-related burnout). ""Workplace resources"" in our study refers to the presence of career education in the workplace, promotion of gender equity, well-being consultation services on ""career and work,"" ""research,"" ""harassment,"" and/or ""mental health,"" as well as the presence of a role model in the workplace who has perceived good work-life balance.ResultsAmong 408 physician-researchers (75% male, mean age 37yrs), personal burnout scores were slightly higher in women than in men (mean score, 41.9 points vs. 36.7 points, difference, 5.2, 95% confidence interval, 0.5-9.9, p=0.029), but work-related and patient-related burnout scores did not differ significantly between genders. Over half of women (64%) and men (58%) had a mentor (p=0.374). In multivariable general linear regression models, personal burnout scores were higher for women (beta =4.98, p=0.045), and lower among those who had a mentor (beta=-5.82, p=0.010) and whose workplaces had well-being consultation services (beta=-0.79, p=0.022).

The new mentee: Exploring Gen Z women medical students' mentorship needs and experiences,"Li, CLD; Veinot, P; Mylopoulos, M; Leung, FH; Law, M","PurposeThe incoming Canadian cohort of medical students is comprised mainly of individuals from Generation Z (Gen Z; born between 1997 and 2012), with greater than 50% of applicants identifying as female. A gap remains in our understanding of Gen Z women learners in their challenges in navigating medical education, their expectations for their medical careers and the influences that have impacted their worldview. This study explored the needs, values, and experiences of Gen Z women medical students and the impact of these factors on mentorship expectations among this population that will soon be entering the workforce.MethodsUpon receiving ethics approval from the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board, semi-structured interviews were conducted (February-May 2021) with 15 Gen Z women students from 14 English-speaking Canadian medical schools who had given written consent to participate. An iterative constant comparative team approach was utilised in which the interview guide and sampling were adjusted as the data evolved. Transcripts were line by line coded into categories, then grouped into themes using descriptive analysis.ResultsThese socially aware learners described how society had afforded them greater opportunities for expression, which gave them a sense of feeling advantaged over older generations. However, participants paradoxically expressed feelings of powerlessness and commented on tensions they experienced when interacting with older generation physician mentors, especially during conversations on social justice issues. They also highlighted instances of biased mentorship specific to their gender. Participants emphasised a desire for inclusive mentorship that considered the mentee's identity and intersectionality.ConclusionsThe growing number of women learners in Canadian medical schools necessitates a re-evaluation of mentorship delivery. Mentors must adapt by integrating Gen Z ideals to overcome mentorship challenges.",2024,,CLINICAL TEACHER,21,3,,WOS:001112887800001,10.1111/tct.13697,,#262,Li 2024,"",""
Increases in female academic productivity and female mentorship highlight sustained progress in previously identified neurosurgical gender disparities,"Taha, B; Sadda, P; Winston, G; Odigie, E; Londono, C; Greenfield, JP; Pannullo, SC; Hoffman, C","OBJECTIVE A meta-analysis was performed to understand disparities in the representation of female authorship within the neurosurgical literature and implications for career advancement of women in neurosurgery.METHODS Author names for articles published in 16 of the top neurosurgical journals from 2002 to 2019 were obtained from MEDLINE. The gender of each author was determined using automated prediction methods. Publication trends were compared over time and across subdisciplines. Female authorship was also compared to the proportionate composition of women in the field over time.RESULTS The metadata obtained from 16 major neurosurgical journals yielded 66,546 research articles. Gender was successfully determined for 96% (127,809/133,578) of first and senior authors, while the remainder (3.9%) were unable to be determined through prediction methods. Across all years, 13.3% (8826) of articles had female first authorship and 9.1% (6073) had female senior authorship. Female first authorship increased significantly over time from 5.8% in 2002 to 17.2% in 2019 (p < 0.001). Female senior authorship also increased significantly over time, from 5.5% in 2002 to 12.0% in 2019 (p < 0.001). The journals with the highest proportions of female first authors and senior authors were the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (33.5%) and the Asian Journal of Neurosurgery (23.8%), respectively. Operative Neurosurgery had the lowest fraction of female first (12.4%) and senior (4.7%) authors. There was a significant difference between the year-by-year proportion of female neurosurgical trainees and the year-by-year proportion of female neurosurgical first (p < 0.001) and senior (p < 0.001) authors. Articles were also more likely to have a female first author if the senior author of the article was female (OR 2.69, CI 2.52-2.86; p < 0.001). From 1944 to 2019, the Journal of Neurosurgery showed a steady increase in female first and senior authorship, with a plateau beginning in the 1990s.CONCLUSIONS Large meta-analysis techniques have the potential to effectively leverage large amounts of bibliometric data to quantify the representation of female authorship in the neurosurgical literature. The proportion of female authors in major neurosurgical journals has steadily increased. However, the rate of increase in female senior authorship has lagged behind the rate of increase in first authorship, indicating a disparity in academic advancement in women in neurosurgery.",2021,,NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS,50,3,,WOS:000624871900004,10.3171/2020.12.FOCUS20939,,#263,Taha 2021,"",""

Mentoring programs can improve women's motivation and persistence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career pathways. However, mentorship programs consist of multiple components that vary in complexity and cost, which can limit scalability. Here we present results from a randomized experiment with 158 undergraduate women majoring in a geoscience field to identify the critical elements of a successful mentorship program. The combination of three factors was necessary to increase mentoring, motivation, and persistence: inspiration through exposure to geoscience careers via female role models, inoculation through training on how to grow their mentor network and overcome obstacles, and an introduction to a local female geoscientist mentor.

Mentorship in Medicine and Other Health Professions,"Henry-Noel, N; Bishop, M; Gwede, CK; Petkova, E; Szumacher, E","Mentoring skills are valuable assets for academic medicine and allied health faculty, who influence and help shape the careers of the next generation of healthcare providers. Mentors are role models who also act as guides for students' personal and professional development over time. Mentors can be instrumental in conveying explicit academic knowledge required to master curriculum content. Importantly, they can enhance implicit knowledge about the ""hidden curriculum"" of professionalism, ethics, values, and the art of medicine not learned from texts. In many cases, mentors also provide emotional support and encouragement. It must be noted that to be an effective mentor, one must engage in ongoing learning in order to strengthen and further mentoring skills. Thus, learning communities can provide support, education, and personal development for the mentor. The relationship benefits mentors as well through greater productivity, career satisfaction, and personal gratification. Maximizing the satisfaction and productivity of such relationships entails self-awareness, focus, mutual respect, and explicit communication about the relationship.

Effects of mentor-mentee discordance on Latinx undergraduates' intent to pursue graduate school and research productivity,"Morales, DX; Grineski, SE; Collins, TW","Owing to an undergraduate demographic transition in STEM, Latinx students are likely to work with faculty from different backgrounds when participating in undergraduate research experiences (UREs). However, the effects of mentor-mentee demographic discordance on student STEM development are unclear. This paper examines how mentoring discordance affects Latinx students' intentions to pursue graduate school and research productivity. We collected data from participants in a multiyear, multi-institutional URE program (n = 171 dyads), which we analyzed using multivariable generalized estimating equations. Results indicate that compared with gender concordance, gender discordance was associated with a 17% increase in intent to pursue graduate school for Latina students. Compared with racial/ethnic concordance, racial/ethnic discordance was associated with a 38% increase in intent to pursue graduate school for Latino students. When paired with gender discordant mentors, Latina students were 70% less likely to present their URE projects at a professional conference. When faculty mentors were culturally competent and interacted with mentees frequently, Latinx students became more interested in pursuing graduate school. Because mentors from different demographic backgrounds contribute to the development of Latinx STEM students in varied ways, URE program directors should integrate opportunities for multiple mentorships.",2021,,ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,1499,1,54-69,WOS:000642321100001,10.1111/nyas.14602,,#268,Morales 2021,"",""

It has been associated with numerous benefits including personal development, increased career satisfaction, and reduced stress and burnout. The purpose of this study was to assess orthopedic resident attitudes regarding mentorship and to determine if there were sociodemographic differences.DESIGN: A total of 243 orthopedic surgery residents completed this 25-item mixed response questionnaire.RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds of residents conveyed that their training program either had a formal or informal mentorship program, and 95.8% of residents indicated that they believed mentorship played an important role with respect to their development as an orthopedic resident. Minorities were more likely to have a mentor that was obtained while they were in medical school, less likely to have multiple mentors, and more likely to be dissatisfied with the quality of mentorship in residency. Females were more likely to pursue a mentor on their own. Overall, 31% of orthopedic residents were classified as experiencing burnout. There was no difference in the prevalence of mentorship in respondents experiencing burnout, but they were more likely to be unsatisfied with the quality of mentorship in residency. Finally, only two-thirds of residency programs have mentorship programs despite the fact that the vast majority of orthopedic residents believe that the mentorship plays an important role in their development as surgeons.RESULTS: Given these findings, future work should focus on identifying and addressing race and sex-based mentorship disparities while simultaneously working to improve access to mentorship for all residents.

Professional development for STEM educators: A bibliometric analysis of the recent progress,"Ahmed, SAM; Zhang, WL; Ma, HL; Feng, ZC","STEM teacher professional development (STEM-TPD) has become a hot topic of educational research. To evaluate the main characteristics, status and trends of this educational field and to provide new insights for future studies, this review applies a bibliometric analysis of relevant publications. The Web of Science (WoS) core collection database was used as the source of bibliographic data for the period 2011-2021; specifically, 776 articles published in 232 journals were selected for this review. The bibliometric analysis was then carried out using Bibliometrix and VOSviewer to explore trends and patterns in the STEM-TDP literature. It is essential to note that the analysis does not account for the quality of the selected studies. However, it presents the results using various perspectives such as citation, co-citation, spatial and lexical networks based on frequencies, network analysis and descriptive patterns. The findings show that the number of relevant publications has grown significantly in recent years, in particular from 2015 to 2021. The findings, based on citation metrics, highlight the most influential authors, institutions and journals in the area. Authors from different countries have contributed to this research area, but there is a low volume of international collaboration among them. The analysis also reveals the dynamic changes in trends, keywords and themes in this research area. The review concludes with some recommendations for future research, and the suggested implications may also benefit other stakeholders in STEM education. Rationale for the studyContext and Implications Implications for researchers, practitioners and policy makersWhy do the new findings matter? STEM education has garnered researchers' interest over the past two decades, but there are few reviews of STEM teacher professional development (STEM-TPD) publications. Therefore, this bibliometric review sought to investigate the expansion of STEM-TPD research. It also serves as a roadmap for future TPD research in STEM education.This comprehensive bibliometric study analysed 776 research publications on STEM-TPD that were published in journals that were indexed by WoS. The findings shed light on recent developments, patterns and trends in STEM-TPD research, as well as international collaboration in STEM-TPD research.The overall findings may benefit the researchers, editorial board, and publishers to focus more on some emerging research themes, which can guide the focus of future research. STEM researchers should consider conducting more ambitious, high-quality empirical research that is likely to yield robust results. They can investigate higher-order thinking skills and other issues related to equity, gender inequality, and teacher attrition. The results also inspire researchers and research institutions to boost international collaboration. Similarly, policy makers and higher education institutions should implement more reforms to educational policies and teacher preparation programmes to improve and sustain STEM education.",2023,,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,11,1,,WOS:000985193200007,10.1002/rev3.3392,,#270,Ahmed 2023,"",""

Ambiguous promotion criteria, increased workloads because of service or citizenship tasks, and a lack of sponsorship are among the barriers that inhibit midcareer faculty's growth into the high-visibility roles needed for career advancement. In addition, issues faced by women midcareer faculty members may be further exacerbated by barriers such as biases, a disproportionate share of family responsibilities, and inequities in recognition and sponsorship. These barriers contribute to slower career growth and higher attrition among women midcareer faculty and ultimately an underrepresentation of women among senior leadership in academic medicine. Here, we describe how a mentoring program involving individuals (eg, mentors, mentees, and sponsors) and departments/institutions (eg, deans and career development offices) can be used to support midcareer faculty. We also provide recommendations for building a mentoring program with complementary support from sponsors targeted toward the specific needs of women midcareer faculty. A robust midcareer mentoring program can support the career growth and engagement of individual faculty members and as a result improve the diversity of academic medicine's highest ranks.",2022,,JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS,42,3,197-203,WOS:000844281500010,10.1097/CEH.0000000000000419,,#281,Keating 2022,"",""
How mentoring and a shift in mindset and practices can help navigate fast-paced science,"Bercht, AL; Kamm, R","In the competitive realm of academia, the pursuit of meaningful knowledge often collides with the imperative to publish quickly and frequently, sidelining patient investigation and deep understanding. This article aims to share critical insights into this issue, sparking further discussions about the challenges of fast-paced science and cultivating a more ethical scientific landscape, one that values exploration and ingenuity over rushed output and flashy headlines. The narrative traces the growing disillusionment of the first author with the prevailing publish-or-perish culture and her concerns about its impact on research quality and genuine collaboration. The article showcases how a mentoring programme for women postdoctoral researchers and network activities have aided her in navigating these challenges and carving out her career path. Her experiences are enriched by the perspectives of the second author, the coordinator of the mentoring programme. Through one-on-one mentoring, get-togethers, and workshops, the first author gained the inspiration, skills, and encouragement necessary to rekindle her commitment to science. The lesson learned is the importance of providing scientists with a guided, safe, and brave space for open dialogue about individual concerns and general working conditions in academia. Examples are provided that illustrate potential strategies and practices for challenging the status quo. By nurturing an environment that puts quality before quantity, academia can pave the way for transformative discoveries and profound understanding across all career levels.",2024,,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,,,,WOS:001309414200001,10.1093/icesjms/fsae121,,#282,Bercht 2024,"",""
Mentoring and sponsorship in higher education institutions: men's invisible advantage in STEM?,"O'Connor, P; O'Hagan, C; Myers, ES; Baisner, L; Apostolov, G; Topuzova, I; Saglamer, G; Tan, MG; Caglayan, H","This article is concerned with the source of men's invisible advantage in the male-dominated disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). It is suggested that this advantage has been obscured by combining sponsorship and mentoring. The research asks: Are men or women most likely to be mentored? Is it possible to distinguish between mentoring and sponsorship? Is there gender variation in either or both of these depending on the source - whether from the academic supervisor, line manager or other senior academics? This qualitative study draws on interview data from 106 respondents (57 men and 48 women) at high, mid and early levels, in four universities: one each in Bulgaria, Denmark, Ireland, and Turkey. It shows that both men and women received mentoring from their PhD supervisor, albeit with slightly different reported nuances. Men were more likely than women to receive sponsorship in that relationship. Both men and women received sponsorship from the Head of Department, whose wider responsibilities may have reduced homophily. Men were more likely than women to receive sponsorship and mentoring from senior men, with most women indicating a lack of access to such senior academics. By distinguishing between mentoring and sponsorship, this article contributes to our understanding of the way male dominance in STEM is perpetuated and suggests the source of men's invisible advantage in STEM.",2020,,HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT,39,4,764-777,WOS:000496587300001,10.1080/07294360.2019.1686468,,#283,O'Connor 2020,"",""
Mentorship Is Not Enough: Exploring Sponsorship and Its Role in Career Advancement in Academic Medicine,"Ayyala, MS; Skarupski, K; Bodurtha, JN; González-Fernández, M; Ishii, LE; Fivush, B; Levine, RB","Purpose To explore how sponsorship functions as a professional relationship in academic medicine. Method The authors conducted semistructured interviews with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine faculty in 2016: department chairs (sponsors) and faculty participants of an executive leadership development program (proteges). Using editing analysis style, the authors coded interview transcripts for thematic content; a coding framework and themes were derived using an iterative process. Results Five themes were identified from 23 faculty interviews (12 sponsors, 11 proteges): (1) Mentorship is different: Sponsorship is episodic and focused on specific opportunities; (2) Effective sponsors are career-established and well-connected talent scouts; (3) Effective proteges rise to the task and remain loyal; (4) Trust, respect, and weighing risks are key to successful sponsorship relationships; (5) Sponsorship is critical to career advancement. Sponsorship is distinct from mentorship, though mentors can be sponsors if highly placed and well connected. Effective sponsors have access to networks and provide unequivocal support when promoting proteges. Effective proteges demonstrate potential and make the most of career-advancing opportunities. Successful sponsorship relationships are based on trust, respect, mutual benefits, and understanding potential risks. Sponsorship is critical to advance to high-level leadership roles. Women are perceived as being less likely to seek sponsorship but as needing the extra support sponsorship provides to be successful. Conclusions Sponsorship, in addition to mentorship, is critical for successful career advancement. Understanding sponsorship as a distinct professional relationship may help faculty and academic leaders make more informed decisions about using sponsorship as a deliberate career-advancement strategy.",2019,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,94,1,94-100,WOS:000454199200023,10.1097/ACM.0000000000002398,,#284,Ayyala 2019,"",""
Pediatric Emergency Medicine and Mentoring,"Bechtel, K; Langhan, ML; Levine, D; Hanson, J","BackgroundWomen in medicine have reported gender-specific obstacles to career success, such as a dearth of mentors and role models. Pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) is a female-dominated subspecialty of pediatrics yet is still impacted by gender inequality in many areas. No previous study has explored mentoring experiences of women PEM physicians and the impact on their career trajectory. We sought to explore the experiences of female PEM physicians with mentorship to determine aspects of mentoring that were successful or unsuccessful.MethodsThis was a qualitative study with criterion sampling of female PEM physicians. Members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Emergency Medicine completed semistructured interviews in 2022, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Our research team consisted of 3 PEM physicians. Using the constant comparative method, we analyzed transcripts by inductively developing codes, grouping codes into categories, and refining codes, descriptions, and group assignments to identify themes. Interpretations of and relationships among themes were iteratively discussed and revised by the team.ResultsTwenty-two participants were interviewed via telephone. The mean age of participants was 44 years old, and the majority (73%) identified as White, non-Hispanic, and at the rank of assistant professor (45%). Four themes were identified: (1) benefits of mentorship (recognition of need for mentorship and finding professional success), (2) finding mentors (processes to find mentors and mentor roles), (3) characteristics of successful mentors (personal and professional), and (4) impact of mentorship (career advancement or career sabotage).ConclusionsWe identified 4 themes that could be incorporated into mentoring programs and are associated with successful experiences for women PEM physicians.

It was assumed that the specific many-to-many group-mentoring condition examined in our study would be more effective than the one-on-one mentoring condition with respect to (a) the proportion of STEM communication and (b) the extent of STEM-related networking, both of which are important predictors of successful mentoring. Furthermore, the authors (c) expected more growth in elective intentions for the group-mentoring participants and (d) assumed that participants' centrality in their respective STEM networks would predict this increase.

UNPACKING GENDERED DISCOURSE IN MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WeAreHERe CAMPAIGN,"Colombelli, A; Falzea, L; Montorsi, A; Temporin, G","This research paper conducts a Critical Discourse Analysis of the Instagram campaign run by WeAreHERe, a peer -to -peer mentorship program designed for women high school students and first -year university students at Politecnico di Torino. The study scrutinizes 92 posts shared on the WeAreHERe Instagram page during the academic year 2021-2022. The primary goal of the research is, first, to bridge an existing gap in the literature by connecting studies on stereotypes, biases, and mentorship as a constructive means to promote women's role models with research on gender -based structural oppression. Secondly, this study aims to enhance the WeAreHERe campaign through a comprehensive analysis, ultimately providing insights for shaping future policies about mentorship programs for female students in STEM fields. The analysis showed that most of the posts focus on the individual level rather than on structural oppression and the role models they depict are presented as relatable rather than unique humans. Even when the motivational posts acknowledge the existence of a gender -oppressive structure they seldom mention it clearly, failing to uncover the generative link between this structure of oppression and gender biases and stereotypes. The results show that the literature on stereotypes and biases could be enriched by an approach focused on structural oppression. From these results we developed some guidelines that could help the WeAreHERe campaign - and other similar campaigns that aims at fighting stereotypes about women in the STEM field - to tackle issues of systematic oppression. The use of role models is more effective when it highlights systematic oppression and favours the creation of communities that would help bringing systematic change.",2024,,FEMINISMO-S,,43,177-212,WOS:001173532500001,10.14198/fem.2024.43.08,,#289,Colombelli 2024,"",""
Faculty Development and the Emergency Medicine Educator: A National Needs Assessment,"Karademos, JE; Yarris, LM; Jordan, J; Kuehl, D; Buchanan, J; Gottlieb, I; Mayersak, RJ; Jones, D","Background: Faculty development (FD) encompasses structured programming that aims to enhance educator knowledge, skill, and behavior. No uniform framework for faculty development exists, and academic institutions vary in their faculty development programming, ability to overcome barriers, resource utilization, and achievement of consistent outcomes. Objective: The authors aimed to assess current FD needs among emergency medicine educators from six geographically and clinically distinct academic institutions to inform overall faculty development advancement in emergency medicine (EM). Methods: This crosssectional study assessed FD needs among EM educators. A survey was developed, piloted, and distributed to faculty via each academic institution's internal e-mail listserv. Respondents were asked to rate their comfort level with and interest in several domains of FD. Respondents were also asked to identify their previous experience, satisfaction with the FD they have received, and barriers to receiving FD. Results: Across six sites, 136/471 faculty completed the survey in late 2020 (response rate of 29%): 69.1% of respondents reported being satisfied overall with the FD they have participated in, and 50.7% reported being satisfied with education FD specifically. Faculty report higher comfort levels and interest in several domains when satisfied with the education-specific FD they have received compared with those who report not being satisfied. Conclusions: EM faculty report generally high satisfaction with the overall faculty development they have received, although only half express satisfaction with their education-related faculty development. Faculty developers in EM may incorporate these results to inform future faculty development programs and frameworks. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"Impact of Mentorship, by Gender, on Career Trajectory in an Academic Anesthesiology Department: A Survey Study","Warner, LL; Gali, B; Oxentenko, AS; Schroeder, DR; Arendt, KW; Moeschler, SM","Introduction: Mentorship has been identified as a key component of success in business and in academic medicine. Methods: After institutional review board approval of the study, an email survey was sent to anesthesiologists in one anesthesiology department to assess mentorship status. A survey link was sent to nonrespondents at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. All participants were deidentified. The identification of a mentor was compared by gender, academic rank, and years of practice. Results: Among 233 anesthesiologists, 103 (44.2%) responded to the survey. More than 90% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that having a mentor is important to career success. Of the 103 respondents, 31 (30%) indicated they had a mentor. Overall, 84% of the identified mentors were men; however, this percentage differed significantly between men and women respondents (95% versus 60%; P = .03). Characteristics associated with having a mentor included younger age (P = .007), fewer years since finishing training (P = .004), and working full time (P = .02). For respondent age and years since finishing training, there was some evidence that the association was dependent on the gender of the respondent (age-by-gender interaction, P = .08; experience-by-gender interaction, P = .08). Discussion: Anesthesiologists in this department believed that mentorship led to more academic success.

PEDAGOGIES OF REFLECTION: DIALOGICAL PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT SCHOOLS IN ISRAEL,"Kizel, A","This chapter discusses a form of pedagogy of reflection suggested to be defined as the dialogical-reflective professional-development school (DRPDS) - a framework that develops and empowers students by engaging them in a process of continual improvement, responding to diverse situations, providing stimuli for learning, and giving anchors for mediation. The pedagogy of reflection relates to dialogue not only from a theoretical historical context but also by way of example - that is, it offers empowering dialogues within the traditional teacher-training framework. This chapter outlines the importance of the pedagogy of reflection in the multicultural educational space of the preservice education field in Israel, analyzing the first university PDS model. The pedagogy of reflection in the context of the educational dialogue of educators is outlined as a tool for student empowerment, achieved through a community of learners who dedicate space to the development of their whole personality within the profession, taking a moral stance toward the educational discourse, minimizing judgmentalism and prejudice, creating national/gender equality with the goal of examining the fundamental question of educational performance, and reinforcing their sense of organizational belonging within the system. In these contexts, the chapter is based on the elements of dialogical philosophy exemplified in the thought of Burbules, Nelson, Isaacs, Bohm, and Heckmann and the reflective basis of educational and organizational performance exemplified in the writings of van Manen. The chapter also presents two examples from a project in which teaching units based on dialogue and reflection were developed within a dialogic community that represents in its very being collective empowerment, the possibility of coping with problems that are too large for an individual to solve on his/her own, and an alternative to sealed and alienated organizations.",2014,,"INTERNATIONAL TEACHER EDUCATION: PROMISING PEDAGOGIES, PT A",22,,113-136,WOS:000371827400007,10.1108/S1479-36872014000002200910.1108/S1479-3687201422,,#294,Kizel 2014,"",""
Negotiating mentoring relationships and support for Black and Brown early-career faculty,"King, NS; Upadhyay, B","In this essay, we share historical and structural components of mentoring within institutions of higher education and grapple with technical and moral obligations of support. We argue for more humanizing approaches that embed personal, social, and cultural aspects of mentoring, and seek to disrupt the purposes of mentoring, and for whom? Using a critical approach, we promote justice-oriented and equity-driven models of mentoring that account for excessive teaching loads and service commitments for faculty at minority-serving institutions and Black and Brown faculty at predominantly White institutions. Current promotion and tenure publish or perish models neglect the intellectual and scholarly contributions made through teaching and service and therefore hold the same level of expectations for engagement in and dissemination of research. We share our own stories as Faculty of Color navigating institutional structures during the promotion and tenure process, while also negotiating incongruent cultures of our personal and professional lives. Furthermore, we address the need for mentoring and networking within exclusionary spaces to support the productivity and critical research agendas of Black and Brown faculty that often challenge the white heteronormative cultures of our institutions, professional organizations, peer-reviewed journals, and prestigious funding mechanisms. Implications of this essay include an acknowledgment of oppressive systems that early-career Black and Brown faculty often navigate and a call for diverse mentoring programs and supports that conform with and validate our lives and needs.

"""It's good for the soul:"" Perceptions of a formal junior faculty mentorship program at a large academic cancer centre","Croke, J; Tosoni, S; Ringash, J","Background: Mentorship fosters professional and personal growth; however, the components essential to program success remain unclear. Our objective was to evaluate and explore the impact of a junior faculty mentorship program within an academic radiation oncology department. Materials and Methods: In 2016, our institution implemented a junior faculty mentorship program consisting of: (1) an orientation handbook; (2) faculty development sessions; and (3) direct, one-to-one selection of a mentor. Confidentiality agreements are signed, a goals template is provided, and meeting dates are tracked. Mentors/mentees were invited to participate in a program evaluation using mixed methodology: a questionnaire followed by a one-on-one semi-structured interview to explore perceptions of the program. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Descriptive statistics summarized questionnaire results and thematic analysis summarized interview results. Results: Eleven junior faculty have selected 10 mentors. Of these, 17 completed the evaluation questionnaire (81%) (7 mentors, 10 mentees; 5 women, 12 men) and 13 were interviewed (62%) (5 mentors, 8 mentees; 3 women, 10 men). The majority (80%) have participated in the program for >2 years. Although most mentees report additional mentors, 30% report this as their sole mentorship relationship. Four themes emerged: (i) Components of an Ideal Mentoring Relationship, (ii) The Value of Mentorship, (iii) Sponsorship, in addition to Mentorship and (iv) Cultivating Departmental Bonds and Boundaries. Conclusion: Implementation of a junior faculty mentorship program within an academic radiation oncology department is feasible.

Exploring the Impact of a Women's Mentorship Program in Surgery: Perspectives and Experiences of Mentees and Mentors,"Moeckel, C; Oxford, M; Cooper, A","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a formal women's mentorship program in surgery at a single institution, evaluating its perceived benefits, challenges, and impacts from the perspectives of both mentees (medical students) and mentors (resident and attending surgeons). DESIGN: This study utilized a qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences and perspectives of participants in a women's mentor- ship program in surgery. Medical students, residents, and attending surgeons who had participated in the mentorship program were invited to be interviewed. Interviews were conducted virtually and audio-recorded for subsequent transcription and analysis. SETTING: The study was conducted at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Penn State Health is a tertiary-care facility. PARTICIPANTS: 14 mentees (medical students) and 7 mentors (resident and attending surgeons) who had participated in the mentorship program were interviewed. RESULTS: Mentees valued the mentorship program for its networking opportunities, career guidance, and structured goal setting. They appreciated having women mentors who provided unique insights and support in navigating challenges specific to women in surgery. The program's flexibility and session frequency allowed mentees to explore multiple specialties early in their education. Mentors appreciated the program's flexibility and the chance to mentor motivated students early in their careers. They highlighted the importance of gender-specific mentorship and the opportunity to facilitate practical experiences like shadowing and research. Challenges included occasional communication gaps, suggesting the need for more check-ins from program leaders and a structured event to facilitate initial connections and enhance continuity in mentor-mentee relationships. CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the effectiveness of a formal women's mentorship program in surgery, as perceived by both mentees and mentors. Recommendations included maintaining flexibility, organizing an annual structured event, and promoting continuity in mentorship relationships. (J Surg Ed 82:103338.

We came together explicitly mindful of and valuing our differences - one woman and two men; our ethnocultural heritages being Greek, African, and English, with different trajectories towards our professional positions; and we highlight differentials in privilege emerging along lines of gender, race, and class. Emergent themes include: 'the visible - invisible spectrum of privilege,' 'the historic present,' and 'power with versus power over.' As an ongoing, highly relational form of encounter, this project highlighted the benefits this approach can bring in the ongoing development of therapists. Participation facilitated the revelation of more unconscious or unarticulated material. We found the duoethnography depended upon our mutual negotiation of trust and preparedness to be vulnerable in the encounter. Recognising that each dialogue brings unique configurations of similarity and difference, we thus argue for greater uptake of duoethnography methods in counselling and psychotherapy training and research.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS,22,,,WOS:001080046300001,10.1177/16094069231199903,,#299,Hills 2023,"",""
Creation of a Professional Development Program for Women in a Major US Medical School Pathology Department,"Gronowski, AM; Burnham, CAD","Background: Improving promotion and retention of women in pathology at major medical schools is important, especially in schools and departments that are below Association of American Medical College averages for these metrics. Our objective was to create a professional development program for women within the Department of Pathology at Washington University School of Medicine and to assess its perceived value.Methods: A forum for women faculty, residents, and fellows was created and has been in place for 5 years. The forum meets once per month; the content includes various topics, articles, books, and invited speakers and covers a broad range of professional development subjects. The success of the forum was assessed by surveying attendees. A survey was created with Surveymonkey.com and sent to 65 women who had been invited to the forum over the 5-year period.Results: Responses were received from 26/65 (40%) women surveyed. junior faculty constituted 42% of attendees, with fellows, residents, midcareer faculty, and senior faculty attending in the descending order of frequency. All responders found the forum valuable. The most valuable content can be broken into 2 major themes: (a) issues facing women in medicine (such as unconscious bias) and (b) tools for improving professional development (such as negotiation skills for women).Conclusions: Survey responses and comments indicate that this forum is perceived as extremely valuable. This format and content could easily be replicated in any academic department. Knowledge of what topics women found the most valuable can help direct the content and enhance successful outcomes of this type of professional development program.",2018,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED LABORATORY MEDICINE,3,3,498-506,WOS:000501130200017,10.1373/jalm.2018.026823,,#300,Gronowski 2018,"",""
STEM mentoring and the use of the principles of Adult Mentoring Inventory,"Feldhaus, C; Bentrem, K","Purpose - The purpose of this convergent parallel mixed methods paper is to explore the mentoring experience within the context of a science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) specific mentoring program for urban, at risk, high school youth, using the Principles of Adult Mentoring Inventory (PAMI) as an instrument that modeled effective mentoring behavior. The study took place at a large, urban, Midwestern university in the USA.Design/methodology/approach - A research design was developed and both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in parallel, analyzed separately and then merged to determine results. The PAMI instrument that measures six constructs of mentor effectiveness was administered to STEM mentors as a pre/post-test and enabled researchers to collect quantitative data. Researchers used focus groups to collect qualitative data in the form of transcribed interviews. This study sought to inform STEM mentoring program development by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data independently and simultaneously in order to confirm findings. Researchers used a convergent parallel mixed methods design to first, reinforce and corroborate the findings given the small sample size (n = 8); second, minimize alternative interpretations from data gathering and analysis, third, make clear various factors contributing to the effectiveness of STEM mentoring.Findings - Throughout the mentoring experience, mentor perceptions of their mentoring abilities increased to be in the ""more highly effective"" range within PAMI. In five of the six constructs the results indicated mentors scored lower on the pre-test than they did on the post-test of the PAMI, meaning mentor perceptions of mentoring abilities improved overall during the course and the mentoring experience. Common themes from both quantitative and qualitative results were developed, are discussed using the PAMI constructs as organizers, and include communication, information, and gender differences.Originality/value - This study added to the dearth of literature and investigations surrounding STEM mentoring. Many studies have concentrated primarily on mentoring but few have investigated the concept of STEM mentoring program best practices. The results of this study provided a multidimensional look at STEM mentoring programs that impact urban, at risk, high school youth.",2015,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTORING AND COACHING IN EDUCATION,4,3,213-235,WOS:000218739300005,10.1108/IJMCE-11-2014-0039,,#301,Feldhaus 2015,"",""
Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Results From the Radiation Oncology Academic Development and Mentorship Assessment Project (ROADMAP),"Holliday, EB; Jagsi, R; Thomas, CR; Wilson, LD; Fuller, CD","Purpose: To analyze survey information regarding mentorship practices and cross-correlate the results with objective metrics of academic productivity among academic radiation oncologists at US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited residency training programs.Methods and Materials: An institutional review board-approved survey for the Radiation Oncology Academic Development and Mentorship Assessment Project (ROADMAP) was sent to 1031 radiation oncologists employed at an ACGME-accredited residency training program and administered using an international secure web application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies. Data collected included demographics, presence of mentorship, and the nature of specific mentoring activities. Productivity metrics, including number of publications, number of citations, h-index, and date of first publication, were collected for each survey respondent from a commercially available online database, and m-index was calculated.Results: A total of 158 academic radiation oncologists completed the survey, 96 of whom reported having an academic/scientific mentor. Faculty with a mentor had higher numbers of publications, citations, and h- and m-indices. Differences in gender and race/ethnicity were not associated with significant differences in mentorship rates, but those with a mentor were more likely to have a PhD degree and were more likely to have more time protected for research. Bivariate fit regression modeling showed a positive correlation between a mentor's h- index and their mentee's h- index (R-2 = 0.16; P<.001). Linear regression also showed significant correlates of higher h- index, in addition to having a mentor (P=.001), included a longer career duration (P<.001) and fewer patients in treatment (P=.02).Conclusions: Mentorship is widely believed to be important to career development and academic productivity. These results emphasize the importance of identifying and striving to overcome potential barriers to effective mentorship.

Perceptions Regarding Mentorship Among General Surgery Trainees With Academic Career Intentions,"Myers, SP; Littleton, EB; Hill, KA; Dasari, M; Nicholson, KJ; Knab, LM; Neal, MD; Horvath, KD; Krone, M; Hamada, GG; Rosengart, MR","OBJECTIVE: Effective mentorship may be an opportunity to mitigate career de-prioritization, improve stress management, and bolster professional growth. Relatively few studies address specific challenges that occur for general surgery trainees. We conducted a focus group based investigation to determine facilitators/barriers to effective mentorship among general surgery residents, who are intending to pursue an academic career.DESIGN: A semistructured focus group study was conducted to explore residents' attitudes and experiences regarding (1) needs for mentorship, (2) barriers to identifying mentors, and (3) characteristics of successful mentor-mentee interactions. Subjects self-identified and were characterized as either ""Mentored"" or ""Nonmentored."" Transcriptions were independently reviewed by 3 coders. Inter-rater reliability between the coders was evaluated by calculating Cohen's kappa for each coded item.SETTING: General surgery residents from 2 academic tertiary hospitals, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and University of Washington, participated.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four general surgery trainees were divided into 8 focus groups.RESULTS: There were no gender-based differences in mentoring needs among residents. Barriers to establishing a relationship with a mentor, such as lack of exposure to faculty, and time and determination on the part of both mentor and mentee, were exacerbated by aspects of surgical culture including gender dynamics, criticism, and hierarchy. Successful relationships between mentee and mentor were perceived to require personal/professional compatibility and a feeling that the mentor is invested in the mentee, while conflicts of interest and neglect detracted from a successful relationship.CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations demonstrate the importance of surgical hierarchy and culture in facilitating interpersonal interactions with potential mentors. Further studies will be necessary to determine how best to address these barriers. (C) 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The VIP has been shown as a cost-effective intervention to significantly reduce CVD mortality. However, little is known about the effectiveness of a digital solution to tailor risk communication strategies for supporting behavioral change. STAR-C aims to develop and evaluate a technical platform for personalized digital coaching that will support behavioral change aimed at preventing CVD.Methods: STAR-C employs a mixed-methods design in seven multidisciplinary projects, which runs in two phases during 2019-2024: (i) a formative intervention design and development phase, and (ii) an intervention implementation and evaluation phase. In the 1st phase, STAR-C will model the trajectories of health behaviors and their impact on CVDs (Project 1), evaluate the role of the social environment and social networks on behavioral change (Project 2) and assess whether and how social media facilitates the spread of health information beyond targeted individuals and stimulates public engagement in health promotion (Project 3). The findings will be utilized in carrying out the iterative, user-centered design, and development of a person-tailored digital coaching platform (Project 4). In the 2nd phase, STAR-C will evaluate the implementation of the coaching programme and its effectiveness for promoting behavioral change and the spreading of health information across social networks and via social media (Project 5). The cost-effectiveness (Project 6) and ethical issues (Project 7) related to the coaching programme intervention will be evaluated.Discussion: The STAR-C research programme will address the knowledge and practice research gaps in the use of information technologies in health promotion and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention programmes in order to narrow the health inequality gaps.Ethics: STAR-C has received approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr. 2019-02924;2020-02985).Dissemination: The collaboration between Umea University and Region Vasterbotten will ensure the feasibility of STAR-C in the service delivery context.

Our results show that heterogeneity stemming from research orientation is helpful. Academics who bridge between the quest for fundamental understanding and socio-economic relevance attain career success. Yet heterogeneity stemming from gender hinders careers: female academics face problems securing tenured positions and full professorships. Mentor-mentee heterogeneity only helps in early career transitions, but hampers advancement later on.

Exploring the factors affecting career progression in informal faculty mentoring sessions within mentor and mentee relationships: a qualitative study,"Niazi, M; Mahboob, U; Shaheen, N; Gul, S; Saeed, MHB; Kiyani, A","BackgroundMentoring plays a pivotal role in mentees' professional advancement. However, the factors that affect career progression in informal mentoring relationships, especially with respect to faculty members, have not been extensively explored. This study aimed to explore the factors that affect career progression in informal faculty mentorings within mentor and mentee relationships.MethodologyA Qualitative Exploratory Study was designed and conducted from May to October 2023. Faculty members with informal mentoring relationships were recruited through purposive sampling. Seven faculty mentors and eight faculty mentees from various institutions participated in the study. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data, which were audio-recorded and verbatim transcribed. The transcripts were then analysed using NVivo Software and coded. Braun and Clark's framework was used for the thematic analysis. The study adhered to the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) checklist to ensure comprehensive and transparent reporting of the qualitative research process.ResultsA total of 76 codes emerged which were classified into six themes: (1) an ideal mentee, (2) an ideal mentor, (3) factors promoting the relationship, (4) the role of gender, (5) factors deteriorating the relationship, (6) overcoming barriers / trust-building strategies. Within each theme, mentor-mentee needs and behaviours were identified, which could lead to positive or deteriorating outcomes.ConclusionFactors affecting career progression in informal faculty mentoring sessions include mentees' positive mindset, internal motivation and clarity of vision, mentors' skills, reputation, and role modelling. Effective communication, trust, respect, and clear goals are also essential. Challenges, such as busy schedules, cross-gender mentoring, and societal biases, affect these relationships.

"How the Menstrual Cycle Can Be Utilized During Sports Training, Performance, and Recovery through Wearable Technology: A Narrative Review for Researchers, Physicians, Coaches, and Athletes","Hunter, NN; Smith, MA","The menstrual cycle (MC) serves as a vital indicator of overall health and metabolic function, regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and involving a complex interplay of hormones. Understanding these hormonal dynamics is crucial for deciphering an individual's physiological status and performance potential, particularly in athletes. Studies regarding the MC's impact on athletic performance and training often lack inclusivity, standardized methodologies, and inconsistent biological definitions, hindering comprehensive conclusions. Moreover, societal inequalities contribute to the underrepresentation of female athletes in research, exacerbating the lack of understanding regarding female physiology in sports medicine. Leveraging wearable technology presents a promising avenue for both tracking MCs and optimizing athletic training/recovery. Wearables offer real-time monitoring of biometrics that often correlate with hormonal fluctuations, and lifestyle trends (diet, sleep, stress) aiding in personalized training schedules and performance optimization. Integrating data collected by MC dynamics and wearable technology into athletic training has the potential to decrease the generally perceived negative impacts MC has on athletic performance. Addressing gaps in research methodologies and promoting awareness among athletes, coaches, and healthcare professionals are essential steps toward maximizing the potential of MC-informed training strategies.",2024,,SEMINARS IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE,42,02,73-80,WOS:001338971300001,10.1055/s-0044-1791508,,#317,Hunter 2024,"",""

It explores the efficacy, benefits, and barriers within a national pharmacy professional organization mentorship program.MethodsThe mentor and mentee experiences in the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Ambulatory Care Practice and Research Network (PRN) from program years 2019-2022 were assessed using an anonymous online survey, employing a mixed-methods approach. The survey featured quantitative Likert scale and qualitative free-response questions. In addition, publicly available online sources provided data for postprogram placement outcomes of learner participants in the program. Summary statistics were computed from the quantitative data, and content analysis was applied to the qualitative data.ResultsOf the 356 invited program participants, 48 mentors (32.7%) and 18 mentees (8.6%) responded to the survey. Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed on the program's effectiveness, contributing to a high postprogram placement rate in residencies and ambulatory care positions, emphasizing the program's success in supporting career progression. Respondents recognized significant benefits like career development and professional satisfaction. Notable demographic disparities, especially in age, gender, and race, were observed among participants. The study also identified logistical challenges that impeded the program's full potential.ConclusionDespite limitations, including a low number of responses, the study revealed that remote mentorship may positively affect professional development and well-being. The data supports the program-impacted respondent involvement and professional growth.

The Role of Gender and Distance Mentoring in the Surgical Education Research Fellowship,"Falcone, JL; Croteau, AJ; Schenarts, KD","OBJECTIVE: The nature of the mentor-mentee relationship is important in the pursuit of successful research projects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mentor-mentee relationships in the Surgical Education Research Fellowship (SERF) based on gender and geographical distances regarding program completion. We hypothesize that there are no differences for SERF program completion rates based on gender pairs and distances between pairs.METHODS: This was a retrospective study from 2006 to 2011. Mentor-mentee rosters were retrospectively reviewed for program completion, demographics, and PubMeD indexing. Time zone differences and geographic distances between pairs were found with online applications. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables and non-parametric statistics were carried out using alpha = 0.05.RESULTS: Of the 82 individuals accepted into the SERF program, 43 (52%) completed the SERF program during the study period. There were no differences in program completion rates based on fellow gender and gender pairing (all p > 0.05). Different-gender pairs that completed the program (n = 17) were indexed more frequently on PubMed than same-gender pairs that completed the program (n = 24) (41% vs 12%, p = 0.04). There were no differences in program completion based on time zone differences (p = 0.20). The median distance between pairs completing the program (n = 35) was greater than that for pairs not completing the program (n = 36) (1741 km [IQR: 895-3117 km] vs 991 km [IQR: 676-2601 km]; p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Completion of the SERF program was independent of mentor-mentee gender pairs and time zone differences. There was greater geographical distance separating mentor-mentee pairs that completed the SERF program compared with pairs that did not complete the program. Distance mentoring is a successful and crucial element of the SERF program. (C) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Role of mentorship, career conceptualization, and leadership in developing women's physics identity and belonging","Rosenberg, JL; Holincheck, N; Fernández, K; Dreyfus, BW; Wardere, F; Stehle, S; Butler, TN","The percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees in physics (25%) in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from 2 institutions: a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, consistent with the existing literature, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people. While the data on how career conceptualization contributed to the building of identity is limited, there are some connections to recognition and competence, and it will be an interesting avenue of future exploration.",2024,,PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,20,1,,WOS:001187566500001,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.010114,,#323,Rosenberg 2024,"",""
Library Staff are More Motivated to Engage in Professional Development When Encouraged by Library Leadership,"Bussell, H","Objective - This study explores whether there is a correlation between academic library leaders' support for professional development and their employees' professional self-esteem and motivation to participate in professional development.Design - Survey questionnaire.Setting - Academic libraries in Norway.Subjects - 1,637 full time equivalent (FTE) staff.Methods - The theoretical framework for this study is knowledge management. The author defines this as ""The creation and subsequent management of an environment which encourages knowledge to be created, shared, learnt, enhanced, and organized for the benefit of the organization and its customers"" (Sarrafzadeh, Martin, & Hazeri, 2006, p. 624, quoted on p. 3). An anonymous quantitative survey was made available to staff working in Norwegian academic libraries. The survey included questions about to what extent their leader encourages them to attend conferences, to what extent their leader understands their skills and competencies, personal belief in their own skills and competencies to perform their work tasks, and number of professional development activities they attended in 2015 (including conferences, continuing education seminars, and interdepartmental seminars).Main Results - 626 survey responses were collected, for a 38% response rate. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Over 50% of all survey respondents reported high satisfaction with their professional skills and competencies. There is a difference when broken down by gender, with 77% of men reporting confidence in their professional skills versus 63% of women. Education level, on the other hand, does not make a difference. The study found a correlation between perception by library staff that their library leader has a ""good overview"" of their professional skills and staff members' confidence in their ability to perform their job well. Library staff with leaders who encouraged professional development were more likely to participate in external professional development activities. Participation in internal professional development activities was not affected by library leaders' encouragement.Conclusion - When library staff are encouraged by library leadership to participate in professional development, they are more likely to do so. Library staff who perceive that their library's leaders recognize and value their professional skills and competencies have a higher sense of professional self-esteem. Library leaders can use knowledge management to come to a better understanding of the knowledge and skills their staff members already possess, and to encourage communities of practice and the sharing of knowledge in the organization. This recognition can result in employees who are happier and more motivated to learn.",2019,,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,14,1,59-61,WOS:000461297600006,10.18438/eblip29534,,#324,Bussell 2019,"",""
Assessing the diversity-related professional development needs of pre-service teachers,"Toms, OM; Reddig, K; Jones-Fosu, S","Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the diversity-related professional development needs of pre-service teachers in our college. According to a report released in 2017 by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), minorities accounted for 20 per cent of all public elementary and secondary school teachers in the United States during the 2015-2016 school year. The same report noted that 51 per cent of all public elementary and secondary school students in the USA were nonwhite during the same school year. Schools will continue to become increasingly more diverse as it relates to the student population. Students of color are expected to make up 56 per cent of the student population by 2024 (Digest of Education Statistics, 2013). With the changing demographics of US schools, pre-service teachers must be prepared to teach, interact and support students and families whose cultures, beliefs and lifestyles may differ from their own. Cultural competence is having an awareness of one's own cultural identity perceptions and views about difference, and the ability to learn and build on the varying cultural and community norms of students and their families (Munoz and Graybill, 2015). The mere presence of diverse communities on college campuses is not sufficient in promoting positive educational outcomes related to diversity (Museus, 2008). Design/methodology/approach Qualitative survey research was used to assess diversity related professional development needs of pre-service teachers. Students were asked an open-ended question: 'Please list topics of diversity training that should be offered to students in the college' After the question, a text box was provided to allow respondents to provide a unique answer. This approach, as opposed to providing a list of predetermined responses to select from gave respondents the freedom to say exactly what they felt should be offered. Findings After analyzing the 163 open-ended responses provided by students six themes emerged. The themes were offering diversity-related professional development in the areas of disability/mental illness, cultural competence/awareness, LGBTQAI+/gender, facilitating conversations about diversity, discrimination and race/ethnicity.Research limitations/implications - The sample came from one university; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other predominantly white universities. Future research should collect data at other universities or the schools within the university system to determine the needs for other campuses. The results of such a study will always be limited in scope but they do describe the needs at the targeted University. The response rate was low, 24 per cent. The reasons for the low response rate are unclear. Other survey techniques, such as mail surveys or face-to-face meetings, may be more successful in obtaining a higher response rate. Practical implications - Teacher preparation programs should assess students' perceptions, knowledge and experiences as it relates to diversity, and survey pre-service teachers to determine gaps in the diversity training currently being offered. Diversity training must be intentional to prepare pre-service teachers to meet the demands of the diverse classroom. Social implications Future research should aim to assess pre-service teachers' beliefs about diversity throughout the entirety of teacher preparation programs by assessing pre-service teachers in multiple classes and participants who attend independent diversity training opportunities. To address the rapid increase in cultural and ethnic diversity in education worldwide, pre-service programs should target and challenge pre-service teachers' beliefs to assure equitable education to diverse students.

Navigating Barriers and Mentoring Support: The Career Goals of Women Doctoral Students in Chemistry,"Zhang, Qiyue","In chemistry, women are still underrepresented in the postbaccalaureate stages. However, there has been limited discussion in STEM education that treats chemistry as a singular discipline and explores doctoral students' experiences from a mentoring perspective. This qualitative research study investigated how contextual factors (i.e., social barriers and social support) and personal factors (i.e., being a female student) influence students' motivation and career goals in chemistry based on the Social Cognitive Career Theory, with an emphasis on mentoring experience as one of the contextual factors. Fourteen women doctoral students were interviewed. The findings revealed that women students rarely planned to stay in academia because of the barriers they experienced, such as the overwork norm. Women students faced microaggressions, such as others questioning their ability, a lack of sense of belonging, and unequal involvement in administration work. Mentoring support as a format of social support can mitigate these challenges. However, students' needs were nuanced depending on their developmental stages.

Activity for CUREs to Increase Student Understanding and Application of Responsible Authorship and Publication Practices,"Wilson, Kristy J; Mitchel, Alexis","Professional development of scientists is enhanced by training students in responsible conduct of research earlier in their careers. One aspect of responsible conduct of research is authorship ethics, which concerns granting of credit to those who make intellectual contributions to the research. The activity discussed in this article emphasizes how authorship ethics can be integrated with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) and includes an adaption that could also be used for independent research students. The activity allows students to reflect upon inequalities and problems seen in scientific authorship, including gender bias, failure to credit effort (ghostwriters), and inclusion of authors that did not meaningfully contribute to the work (honorary/gift authorship). Themes seen in student reflections on how they could demonstrate ethics in authorship included: determining authorship by contribution, appropriate attributions on curriculum vitas (CV) and posters, different credit levels, understanding authorship criteria, and tracking contributions. Themes seen in student reflections on the importance of authorship were proper authorship credit distribution, authorship impacting career opportunities, and accountability in research. In the activity, students also created attributions for a poster to be presented from their research. We found that most students were able to create attributions that were correctly formatted, included the same authors, and positioned authors in the same order as other group members, matching what was presented on the finalized poster. We found that students' reflection on authorship and this professionalization of their activities in their CURE led to modest increases in their view of themselves as scientists.",2024,,Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education,25,2,,3112180391; EJ1437973,,,#329,Wilson 2024,"",""

Professional STEM societies provide students with a range of resources that help them persist in STEM, though qualitative research shows that such societies geared toward queer and trans students may offer less professional and academic resources and prioritize identity management. The objective of our research is to identify, among queer and trans students, whether there are differences between how TNBGNC+ students and gender majoritized students access resources important in STEM persistence across professional society types, including those societies organized to serve women, racial/ethnic minoritized groups, queer and trans groups, as well as those science societies and chapters without a stated group focus. The society resources we focus on include: sense of community, social networking, professional resources, leadership skills, academic resources, reduced isolation related to identities, and perceptions that societies in which they may participate are helpful to them in their degree progress. This study offers an analysis of survey data from 477 queer and trans STEM undergraduates relating to their participation in STEM professional societies. To conduct this research, we embraced and enacted recommendations by scholars on strategies and frameworks to queer our methodology, survey, and analysis. We found that at oSTEM, TNBGNC+ students may not be benefitting to the same extent as gender majoritized students when it comes to feeling in community with other members and having opportunities for social networking. However, TNBGNC+ students may benefit more from a reduction in isolation related to their identities. Differences in how SWE served TNBGNC+ students echoes previous work, and may speak to the society's organization around the cisgender, patriarchal framework. SHPE's relative success with TNBGNC+ students also reproduces existing work, suggesting the society may be more largely scaffolded for more affirming environments writ large. As well, that science in comparison to industry chapters were more beneficial to TNBGNC+ students brings forward possible differences between science and industry chapters, in which the former may be influenced more by the scholarship and science of gender, while the latter, with its more business and public focus, could be more influenced by dominant narratives in STEM. This work has implications for societies when it comes to enacting policies to cultivate more inclusive community environments and buttress potentially unequal access to social networking as well as professional and academic resources.

Influence of a Multiphase Inquiry-Based Learning Project on Students' Science Literacy,"Machado, Crystal; Nahar, Lizoon","Globally, fewer students are choosing careers in science. In developing countries like Bangladesh, this attrition is often attributed to limited access to laboratories, lack of qualified science teachers, and limited use of student-centered strategies (SCS). Educators are attempting to design professional development programs to empower teachers with innovative teaching methods that will eventually boost enrolment in STEM-related fields. With this end in mind, we designed a six-month-long grant-funded project that equipped five urban schools in Bangladesh with 20 science toolkits. We also provided 20 science teachers and five site coordinators with ongoing professional development to support use of these toolkits with 109 students for inquiry-based learning (IBL). Using an explanatory sequential design, we analyzed quantitative and qualitative data from three surveys. We also used transcripts from interviews with five site coordinators and four Zoom panel presentations to understand the numeric findings. While quantitative analysis with SPSS revealed that teacher-centered strategies (TCS) continue to be widespread in Bangladesh, we noted that the IBL project influenced student outcomes in several ways. The qualitative data confirmed that teachers who receive training and support over an extended period implemented SCS quite effectively. Both quantitative and qualitative findings revealed that a shift from TCS to SCS enhanced students' ability to hypothesize, experiment, and make real-life connections. In this paper, we describe statistically significant differences in the students' knowledge across curriculum type and gender. We also describe the influence of the project on student attitudes.",2023,,"Journal of Education in Science, Environment and Health",9,3,206-223,2901458027; EJ1398596,,,#340,Machado 2023,"",""
A Study on Scientific Thinking Skills and Professional Experience of Teachers,"Saparbaikyzy, Sholpan; Assilbayeva, Fatima; Botabayeva, Ademi; Kim, Olga; Akparova, Zhanna; Bekbayeva, Malika","Scientific thinking is considered as a cognitive process in which the underlying causes of a basic problem are solved. It is of great importance for teachers to have scientific thinking skills to improve their professional lives, to create effective learning environments, to continuously question the events and processes in the classroom, to carry out research, to identify problems and to produce solutions. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a significant difference between teachers' scientific thinking skills and variables such as gender, seniority and branch. The research was conducted based on the comparative descriptive survey model. The data obtained concerning the demographic characteristics of the teachers were analyzed with frequency and percentage techniques. In the analyses between the demographic characteristics of the subjects and their scientific thinking skills, arithmetic mean, t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which were selected according to the characteristics of the groups, were used. For the research, the Scientific Thinking Skills Scale developed by Göktürker (2005) was adapted into Kazakh and applied to the teachers.

Research Trends and Issues of Engineering Design Process for STEM Education in K-12: A Bibliometric Analysis,"Ali, Muhammad; Tse, Alex Wing Cheung","The study performed a bibliometric analysis on research literature related to 'engineering design process' (EDP) that has emerged as a popular approach for STEM education in K-12. The literature comprised 142 journal articles published from 2011 to 2021. There are three objectives of the study. Firstly, to identify the leading research trends of EDP for STEM education that have developed since the release of ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"" in 2011. This framework is pivotal as it paved the way for the establishment of the ""Next Generation Science Standards"" in the United States. Secondly, to discern possible research issues on the aforesaid topic by analyzing the research trends. Lastly, to identify publications and authors that have generated prominent citation impact. Since EDP is an emergent approach for STEM education, fulfilling these three objectives can be conducive in facilitating future researchers to build upon the past foundation of research. In this study, the bibliometric data was identified and exported from ""Web of Science Core Collection"": a database with rich scientific literature.

English Language Teaching (ELT) Appraisal in the Trifocal System of the Philippine Education: Basis for Policy and Advancement Program,"Baesa-Alfelor, Xenia S.; Ocampo, Darrel M.","This study explored the English Language Teaching appraisal of teachers in the trifocal Philippine education system in the Bicol Region as a basis for policy and advancement programs. This study used the descriptive-comparative-associational method using a content-validated and reliability-tested questionnaire. The frequency and percentage technique, weighted mean, Chi-Square, and Anova Test of Variance were used in the data treatment. Findings revealed that ELT teachers were predominantly females with 73.97%, CHED, 80.21%, DepEd, and 71.43% TESDA along age groups of early and mid-30s and 46 years above. They served the agencies for less than 10 years, mostly married. Professionally, these teachers were still pursuing post-graduate education and attending training. Along with appraisals on their professional and work responsibility, ELT Trifocal teachers very evidently performed their professional and work responsibilities; on the delivery system, respondents conveyed the mastery and application of theoretical and pedagogical knowledge; on their communicative competencies, they were classified as experts. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference among ELT teachers' appraisal in the three systems (F--value 2.21< t-value 3.35; 5% level of significance). It follows that Philippine education has maintained an undeviating quality of ELT teachers regardless of which system of education they belong. The result showed no variations in ELT competencies despite differences in modalities, urgencies, and the attainment of quality education. Findings also unveiled that the ELT teachers' appraisal and integration of ICT to language teaching are directly associated with their age, sex and civil status, and educational attainment. The higher the educational attainment, the higher the integration of ICT in language teaching. With these results, a policy development for the Professional Advancement Program in ELT was crafted.",2023,,Online Submission,3,1,40-48,2890033013; ED631210,,,#343,Baesa-Alfelor 2023,"",""
Facilitating the Success of Women's Early Career Grants: A Local Solution to a National Problem,"Stoop, Chatanika; Belou, Rebecca; Smith, Jessi L.","Grant funding is essential to the advancement of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields with certain grants viewed as especially prestigious and career formative.

Impact on Student Learning, Perception of the Discipline, and Gender Gaps","El-Hamamsy, Laila; Bruno, Barbara; Audrin, Catherine; Chevalier, Morgane; Avry, Sunny; Zufferey, Jessica Dehler; Mondada, Francesco","Background: Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) for all is critical to broaden participation and promote equity in the field. But how does the introduction of CS and CT into primary school curricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students? Methodology: We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) programme from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning and perception data from three studies with, respectively, 1384, 2433 and 1644 grade 3-6 students (ages 7-11) and their 83, 142 and 95 teachers. Results: Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as pre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers' demographics or motivation on student learning, with teachers' perception of the CS-PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless, gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls differently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). Conclusion: This article highlights how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and supports the importance of (i) early introductions to CS for all; (ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes; and (iii) having developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of students.",2023,,International Journal of STEM Education,10,,,2890009351; EJ1395521,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-023-00438-3,,#351,El-Hamamsy 2023,"",""

A robust instrument that can help administrators and teacher educators gauge the levels of TIB among their teachers will facilitate the promotion of innovative behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This study tested a multidimensional innovative behavior inventory (IBI), innovation support inventory (ISI) and innovation output (IO) in a developing nation (India) context with public school teachers (n = 34,754), for reliability, validity, measurement invariance and structural invariance across caste, gender and subject groups. Findings: The IBI, ISI and IO showed good reliability and validity along with full measurement invariance at configural, metric and scalar levels. With respect to the structural parameters, the inventories exhibited invariance of factor variance and covariance, but not of factor means. Practical implications: Teacher innovative behavior (TIB) is seen by developing country education administrators as a tool to address difficult problems. With better measurement, it will be possible to identify teachers who need training in creativity and entrepreneurial behavior, teachers who might have developed innovative practices that could be used for teacher development, and ways of promoting competition among teachers.

Navigating Contrapower Harassment in the Sport Classroom as Graduate Teaching Associates: A Collaborative Autoethnography,"Johnson, Emily J.; Beasley, Lauren","While teaching, many graduate teaching associates (GTAs) are exposed to contrapower harassment, as it is common in higher education. Contrapower harassment occurs when a person with more authority is harassed by a person with less authority. In the sport studies classroom, experiences of contrapower harassment are magnified for women, as they are underrepresented in this space. Man-dominated sport environments often see higher rates of harassment. Research has focused on women faculty experiences of harassment in the classroom yet neglected the experiences of women GTAs. This collaborative autoethnography focuses on the experiences of contrapower harassment for two women GTAs in a sport studies department. Collaborative autoethnography allowed the researchers to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, in the context of the sport studies classroom, through a combination of self and collective analysis. Interwoven throughout our myriad experiences was the expression of uncertainty in the face of contrapower harassment.

Investigation into early childhood and primary STEM education highlights teacher professional development as a priority, with a key focus on the awareness of gender issues. This study explores whether and how the STEM practices of early childhood teachers change and develop towards supporting girls' STEM engagement through Conceptual PlayWorlds as a model of practice. Through an educational experiment, the study design involved professional development workshops introducing teachers to the Conceptual PlayWorld model for the intentional teaching of STEM, with ideas on how to engage girls through the five characteristics of a Conceptual PlayWorld. Interview responses of seven teachers and one assistant principal regarding their experience of teaching STEM through Conceptual PlayWorlds are analysed in line with the cultural-historical approach. Findings highlight the teachers' developing consciousness regarding girls' STEM engagement through participation in the professional development workshops and Conceptual PlayWorlds, creating a shift in their teaching practices towards becoming more agentic in actively engaging girls with STEM.

Yet, little is known about how students access lucrative STEM careers and leadership positions via community colleges. This study explores the factors that may promote computing leadership identity among upward transfer students, focusing specifically on gender differences in upward transfer computing student experiences. Methods: This study relies on longitudinal survey data from N = 1,955 computing majors across 15 universities in the United States. I used linear regression with tests of two- and three-way interaction terms to examine how factors associated with computing leadership identity might differ by upward transfer student status and gender. Results: Findings highlight how faculty mentorship, peer support, and involvement in student groups might shape leadership identity among all computing students. Other findings show that time spent working for pay is ""positively"" associated with leadership identity for non-transfers but ""negatively"" associated with leadership identity for upward transfer students. Significant three-way interactions show that parent career and sense of belonging in computing are uniquely associated with leadership identity for upward transfer women. Conclusions: This study identifies contextual factors that are uniquely associated with computing leadership identity for upward transfer students, while identifying ways in which institutions can increase upward transfer students' access to college experiences that are positively associated with leadership identity for all students.

Predictors of Student Academic Success in the Corequisite Model,"Andrews, Da'Mon; Tolman, Steven","The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of community college student academic success in corequisite English and mathematics courses. Academic success was defined dichotomously on a pass or fail basis. The population included 1,934 students enrolled in at least one corequisite English and/or mathematics course at a community college between the fall semester of 2015 and summer semester of 2018. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the following predictors: a student's sex, race, age at time of enrollment, Pell Grant recipient status, first-generation college student status, high school grade point average (HSGPA), placement test scores, academic major, time spent receiving academic tutoring; and corequisite course faculty employment status. The two strongest predictors of student academic success in corequisite English courses were: (1) HSGPA and (2) being female. The three strongest predictors of student academic success in corequisite mathematics courses were: (1) HSGPA, (2) corequisite course faculty employment status, and (3) mathematics course based on major. The strongest predictor in both logistic regression analyses was HSGPA. It is recommended that educational leaders use HSGPA as a metric for placing students in the corequisite model.

However, research has not yet explored factors that promote Ph.D. aspirations among upward transfer computing students, resulting in missed opportunities to support this unique group. Objective: We examine the predictors of upward transfer computing students' Ph.D. aspirations, focusing on how these patterns might be unique for upward transfer women. Method: Relying on longitudinal survey data from upward transfer students across 15 research universities, we use logistic regression with interaction terms to identify the predictors of Ph.D. aspirations. Findings: We found that Ph.D. aspirations were especially frequent among upward transfer women, 14% of whom aspired to earn a Ph.D. Other results highlight the importance of faculty encouragement for graduate study in predicting all upward transfer students' Ph.D. aspirations.

Spatial Development Program for Middle School: Teacher Perceptions of Effectiveness,"Power, Jason Richard; Sorby, Sheryl A.","International comparisons suggest that middle school American students compare poorly to their international peers in tasks that require spatial skills. This deficiency in spatial skills is more prominent in females and has been linked to a lack of developmental activities influenced by gender norms. These deficiencies are especially concerning as increased spatial skills have been repeatedly linked to success in technology and broader STEM learning environments. In females, increased spatial skills have also been linked to positive affective outcomes. Formalised approaches to spatial skill development in middle school are rare and their effectiveness is often limited due to a failure to incorporate the perspectives of practitioners when developing said programs. This paper analyses teacher perceptions of a program designed to address spatial skill development in middle school children.

However, there is minimal research about how mentoring programs influence the development of the social community outcomes of connectedness, satisfaction, social capital, resilience, and communities of practice, or whether these outcomes differ among demographic groups. Purpose: This work examines the social community outcomes of undergraduate engineering mentoring program participants and makes recommendations for programs based on participant experiences and outcomes. Methods: In this exploratory multi-methods study, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine social community among participants in a mentoring program for undergraduate engineering students. More specifically, we administered a survey and conducted interviews to examine the five social community outcomes among engineering undergraduate participants in the University of Michigan's Michigan Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (M-STEM) Academies.

Facilitating the Self-Determination of Undergraduate Women in Physics: The Role of External Validation,"Nehmeh, Ghada; Kelly, Angela M.","Background: The representation of women in physics majors is persistently low despite ongoing calls for reforms to improve gender equality. This article builds upon prior research by applying the sociocognitive construct of self-determination in analysing women's experiences leading to their choice of physics study, along with factors affecting their behavioural persistence and physics identity. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine variables affecting women's physics identities and persistence in pursuing their physics degrees. Factors were explored that impacted the self-determination of women in physics, that is, how their personal resources and socialisation facilitated regulatory behaviours to be successful in the major. Sample: Six women physics majors were recruited from a research university in the Northeast U.S., where all had participated in undergraduate physics research. Design and Methods: This qualitative cross-case study focused on undergraduate women to analyse factors that influenced their experiences in the major. Data collection focused on motivation and support, challenges they encountered, and how they overcame them. By examining these factors, common themes were identified regarding their recruitment and retention in physics, specifically in terms of social integration and external validation. Interview transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological approach to generate a set of integrated themes providing a theoretical explanation for physics major selection and persistence that incorporated aspects of competence, autonomy and social relatedness. Results: The support of faculty, research opportunities and peer socialisation were factors that contributed to the development of self-determination. Hindrances that impacted women's undergraduate experiences included negative gender stereotypes, persistent self-doubt, minority status and unwelcoming classroom cultures. Self-determination was characterised by social integration, confidence, and individual and collective agency.

This study examined 513 pre-service teachers' attitudes towards STEM in terms of multiple variables (department, class level, gender, having a traineeship, or information about STEM) and investigates the relationship between participants' attitudes and academic grade point averages. Participants were pre-service preschool, classroom, science, and mathematics teachers that can be considered the basis of the STEM pipeline. Data were collected via a survey and were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson product-moment correlation. Results show that pre-service science teachers, senior pre-service teachers, and participants who had information or a traineeship about STEM had more positive attitudes towards STEM. There was no relationship between attitudes and grade points. It was also seen that the attitudes towards engineering-technology explain the most variance in the attitudes towards STEM. Therefore, the teacher preparation programs should give more attention to integrate the courses of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and help the pre-service teachers (regardless of their departments) to realize the connectedness of STEM subjects.",2021,,International Journal of Technology in Education,4,2,200-228,2550767271; EJ1297989,,,#407,Kartal 2021,"",""
Using Data Analytics to Investigate Attendees' Behaviors and Psychological States in a Virtual Academic Conference,"Wu, Jiun-Yu; Liao, Chen-Hsuan; Cheng, Tzuying; Nian, Mei-Wen","Amid the pandemic of coronavirus diseases, virtual conferences have become an alternative way to maintain the prosperity of the research community.

Comprehensive Sexual Education and English Language Teaching: An Endeavour from Southern Argentina,"Banegas, Darío Luis","Since the enforcement of Law 26,150 (Congreso de la Nación Argentina 2006) through which a national programme on comprehensive sexual education (CSE) was created, the Argentinian educational system must include perspectives, contents, and discursive practices around CSE across the curriculum in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and initial teacher education. English language teaching is not the exception. In this context, CSE is envisaged as a space for encounters among learners, adults, areas of knowledge, public policies, religious beliefs, and cultural traditions in a framework where human rights, gender diversity, respect, and the right to information from early education is central. In this account of classroom inquiry I describe how CSE has brought together educators and authorities to act accordingly to develop innovative teaching practices that respond to Law 26,150. I draw on notions of language-driven content and language integrated learning (CLIL) to describe the practices and initiatives implemented in one Argentinian province to support teachers' professional development and classroom practices.

Effects of Mentoring Relationship Heterogeneity on Student Outcomes in Summer Undergraduate Research,"Morales, Danielle X.; Grineski, Sara E.; Collins, Timothy W.","Faculty-mentored summer undergraduate research experiences (SUREs) have been shown to increase the diversity of students pursuing research careers. No existing studies have approached the issue of broadening participation in STEM research training by focusing on mentoring relationship heterogeneity (MRH) in the context of SUREs. Increasing MRH occurs when a mentee does not match a mentor in terms of gender and race/ethnicity and when the mentee's research experience depends on relationships with multiple mentors. Drawing on data from a multi-sited SURE program, we examine the effects of MRH on student satisfaction and science identity. Results indicate that students' satisfaction was not significantly affected by MRH. Greater MRH predicted reduced science identity development, but high quality faculty-undergraduate mentoring interactions moderated this negative impact. MRH has the potential to become a positive influence on student training.

Exploring Digital Literacy Levels and Technology Integration Competence of Turkish Academics,"Ayyildiz, Pinar; Yilmaz, Adem; Baltaci, Hasan Serif","Today's individuals are expected to have skills in many areas as a natural consequence of the advances that have been taking place in society and technology. Particularly in developed countries, these skills are also called 21st century skills. Critical, creative and reflective thinking, problem solving and keeping up with the digital age (digital literacy) are some of these skills. Universities play a significant role in raising qualified individuals in our country. Updating the training programs, keeping up with the era and having a say in the digital world makes it a necessity for people who give education in these areas to be competent. From this point of view, this study aimed to explore the digital literacy levels of Turkish academics working in faculties of education and the perceptions of students towards technology integration competence of the academics. In this study, quantitative cross-sectional design was preferred. While selecting the participants, purposeful sampling method was used, and two different participant groups (academics and prospective teachers) were included in the process. Two scales with validity and reliability in the literature were used as data collection tools in the research. In the data collection process, firstly, a survey was administered to academics working in faculties of education, and then another one was conducted with prospective teachers. The results obtained were subjected to quantitative data analysis via SPSS 24 and AMOS 24 software, and descriptive and inferential statistics were generated.

"Mentoring Style, Self-Description, and Academic Achievement in English Class","Simanungkalit, Ate Gueen; Rondonuwu, Joppi Jacobus","The study intended to examine student mentoring, self-description, and academic achievement in a selected private university in Jakarta, Indonesia. There were 150 respondents in the study. The 2 instruments used for collecting data were adopted from Cohen (1995) for identifying the mentoring style of the mentors of the students, and from Marsh (1999) for identifying self-description of the students. The analysis of data employed descriptive statistics (independent t-test) as well as ""Chi""-square, One-way ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA. The research inquiries focused on the following issues: (1) identifying the mentoring style, self-description, and academic achievement of the students; (2) the relationship of mentoring style, self-description, academic achievement, and demographic profiles; and (3) the interactive effects--individual and joint--of mentoring style, self-description, and student academic achievement. The findings of the study showed that 2 mentoring styles were predominant among their mentors: relationship emphasis and mentor model; students perceived themselves with a self-description focused on spiritual values, and students had high academic performance. Both male and female students perceived similar mentoring styles among their mentors, while, 1st year and 2nd-year students perceived mentoring style to be different among their mentors. In self-description, differences were found between genders while there was no difference found between 1st and 2nd-year students. There was no difference found between gender and year of study in the academic achievement, the students showed high performance. Mentoring style and self-description did not have a significant individual or joint difference in academic achievement. Since the students, as a whole had high academic achievement, this study seemed to suggest that the different mentoring styles did not have a difference in their academic achievement. However, that did not mean that mentoring did not work. On the contrary, it seemed that mentoring, regardless of style--based on the high academic achievement scores--did work. However, there was also the possibility that high achieving students might not need mentoring for improving their academic achievement. [Note: The page range (1-10) on the PDF is incorrect.

Given that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) GTAs spend a significant amount of time with undergraduates, measurable impacts on student outcomes have the potential to contribute to the success of undergraduates who have been underrepresented in STEM fields. This study evaluated the effects on academic performance of GTA (n = 50) matching for first-year students (n = 976) in an introductory biology lab course at a Hispanic-serving institution. There was no significant difference in academic performance for students who matched with the gender, race/ethnicity, income, and first-generation status of their GTAs. Results were consistent across multiple cohorts of students, after including statistical controls for prior academic performance and other demographic characteristics and accounting for the nested structure of the data.

An Undergraduate STEM Interdisciplinary Research Program: Factors Predictive of Students' Plans for Careers in STEM,"Tan-Wilson, Anna; Stamp, Nancy; Button, Elizabeth; Khasawneh, Mohammad T.; Rezaeiahari, Mandana","In a year-long undergraduate research program, life science majors were paired with majors in the other STEM disciplines of computer science, engineering, mathematics and physical sciences, to work on interdisciplinary life science projects. Typical teams had one undergraduate in a life science and one from another STEM discipline, along with faculty and graduate student mentors from each of those disciplines. In a survey at the end of the program, undergraduates indicated their career plans: 74% staying in STEM, 26% moving to non-STEM, with most of the latter in healthcare. In the summer phase, the average and range of the total number of interactions between undergraduates and all of their mentors was about the same for students in both career groups. However, students differed in whether they tended to interact more frequently with mentors in their own discipline, or to interact with closer to equal frequency with mentors in both disciplines. Binary logistic regression analysis showed this differential frequency of interaction with mentors by discipline to be predictive of students' career decisions, with students in the non-STEM career group interacting much more within their own discipline and the students in the STEM career group tending to interact almost as frequently with mentors in both disciplines. Analysis also showed that, compared to students who planned on non-STEM careers, those who planned on STEM careers self-reported lower ease of communication with team members but higher ratings for their program experience. Consistent with national data, the student's area of study was predictive: 56% of the life science and 91% of the other STEM majors planned for STEM careers. However, inconsistent with the predominance of men in the STEM workforce, in our program where there were almost equal numbers of men and women in both the life sciences and other STEM fields, there was no gender difference in career choice: 72% of the men and 76% of the women indicated their intention to pursue careers in STEM.",2020,,Journal of STEM Education: Innovations and Research,21,2,19-26,2488225120; EJ1272808,,,#420,Tan-Wilson 2020,"",""

"Role Models, Mentors, and Media Influences","Kearney, Melissa S.; Levine, Phillip B.","Children from low-income backgrounds are less likely to have economically successful role models and mentors in their own families and neighborhoods, and are more likely to spend time with media. In this article, Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine review the theoretical and empirical evidence on how these external forces can influence children's development. The authors also document income-based differences in exposure to social influences. They show that well-designed programs involving role models, mentors, and the media can be deployed deliberately, effectively, and often inexpensively to improve children's social and economic outcomes. After highlighting the theoretical reasons why role models, mentors, and the media could alter a child's life trajectory, the authors report a descriptive analysis showing differences over time and across income class in exposure to these influences. They show that compared to children four decades ago, today's children spend much more time in school and with media, and less time with parents, peers, and other adults. They also show that young children with low socioeconomic status (SES) spend considerably more time exposed to media and considerably less time in school, as compared to higher-SES children, and encounter very different role models in their neighborhoods. Kearney and Levine focus on large-scale analyses that credibly claim that a specific intervention had a causal impact on children's outcomes. The beneficial impact of role models is evident in teachers' ability to positively influence the educational performance and career decisions of students who share the teacher's gender or race. Children who participate in formal mentoring programs see improvements in their school performance and are more likely to avoid the criminal justice system. Exposure to specific media content with positive messaging can lead to improved social outcomes. The authors conclude that interventions designed to improve the social influences encountered by children can make an important contribution toward the goal of increasing rates of upward mobility for children in low-income homes in the United States.",2020,,Future of Children,30,1,83-106,2459015999; EJ1262726,,,#424,Kearney 2020,"",""

Factors Influencing Participation of Underrepresented Students in STEM Fields: Matched Mentors and Mindsets,"Kricorian, Katherine; Seu, Michelle; Lopez, Daniel; Ureta, Elsie; Equils, Ozlem","Background: Women and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The goal of this pilot study is to better understand the beliefs and experiences of underrepresented US students pursuing STEM. Our focus was to gain insights into their mentorship experiences and preferences regarding having mentors who are gender and ethnicity matched. Environmental and psychological factors associated with participants' decision to pursue STEM, such as family influences, academic mindsets, and attitudes towards STEM, were also studied. Methods: We developed a survey tool based on published literature and established instruments, including measures of STEM belonging, science identity, and growth mindset, as well as measures assessing students' views on their STEM participation. We surveyed members of a STEM-focused non-profit who were in college, graduate school, or were recent graduates. Results: Forty-eight adults currently pursuing STEM responded to the survey. The majority (71%) were female and nearly all (96%) identified as an ethnic minority. Most reported knowing someone of their same gender (68%) or ethnicity (66%) with a STEM career who served as a role model. The majority (54%) stated that meeting a STEM professional of their own gender and ethnicity would be effective encouragement to pursue STEM. A similar percentage (56%) believed that media exposure to gender- and ethnicity-matched STEM professionals would be effective encouragement. Most (73%) demonstrated a growth mindset and had strong family support to pursue STEM (68%). Only two-thirds (66%) felt they belonged in STEM careers, and 30% agreed that people in their STEM classes are a lot like them. Conclusion: This study contributes additional information on the views and experiences of diverse students actively pursuing STEM. Most participants indicated the importance of meeting and being mentored in STEM by those of their same gender and ethnicity, either in person or through media.

"Assessing Gender Gaps in Educational Provision, Research and Employment Opportunities in the Transport Sector at the European Level","Pirra, Miriam; Carboni, Angela; Diana, Marco","Serious gaps are found when evaluating the recognition and inclusion of gender aspects in transport strategies, research and innovation. Similar issues can be spotted in the transport labor market, where only 22% of workers are women at the European level. The roots of these limitations are in the low participation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) studies and, therefore, in the traditionally male-dominated transport field occupations. Stemming from the European project TInnGO, the current paper proposes a descriptive analysis to evaluate the gender gaps in educational provision and research in ten European countries. Specific indicators, such as percentages in the gender composition or the presence of university courses dealing with mobility and transport, have been defined and their availability in different countries is verified. In addition, a desktop review of practices for encouraging and supporting women in STEM studies is operated, underling characteristics such as the kind of initiative, the methods and tools used, the target group or the type of promoter.

To increase the number and diversity of students engaging in computer science, young children need opportunities to develop interest and foundational understandings, including computational thinking (CT). Accordingly, elementary teachers need to understand CT, and how to integrate it into their practice. We investigate how to best support elementary teachers in learning to integrate CT into their science teaching through a CT professional development experience for elementary teachers. The professional development consisted of two parts: a professional development workshop and a science teacher inquiry group.

How Not to Scare off Women: Different Needs of Female Early-Stage Researchers in STEM and SSH Fields and the Implications for Support Measures,"Cidlinská, Katerina","Women researchers are underrepresented in almost all research fields. There are disciplinary differences in the phase in which they tend to quit their academic career: in the natural and technical sciences (STEM), it is in the postdoctoral phase, whereas in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) it is during the doctoral phase. This is indicative of disciplinary differences in the barriers women face in their careers. Related studies on these barriers are more numerous in the STEM field, which in turn limits the scope of potential policies and measures that address the needs of women in the SSH field. This article aspires to contribute to an understanding of the obstacles women from different fields face in their careers and to offer a reflection on various support measures. Using qualitative data (interviews, focus groups, workshop notes, evaluation forms) from a Czech mentoring programme for female junior researchers across all fields, the subsequent analysis reveals disciplinary differences in the perceived career path obstacles in research as well as the attitudes held towards it. Furthermore, the analysis points to the reasons for these obstacles and attitudes by using the concept of professional identity, a useful tool for identifying the barriers to the development of professional career ambitions. Additionally, the analysis utilises Becher and Trowler's categorisation of SSH and STEM fields into rural and urban categories, enabling one to reflect on the social, cognitive and power features of these fields and the influence these features have on the conditions for the start of an academic career. In order to motivate women to complete their PhD and to apply for a job in academia, this article argues that measures should be taken in the SSH field to promote the involvement of women in the academic community right from the start of their PhD, and therefore, along with mentoring, sponsorship is also needed. In the natural and technical sciences, it is crucial to present women in the late doctoral and early postdoctoral phase with positive female role models -- not as token superstars, but as young researchers who are just a few career steps ahead and who have managed to balance their career with a family in the frame of an egalitarian partnership. Furthermore, it is necessary to increase the gender sensitivity of these female researchers in order to prevent feelings of scientific inefficacy arising from the discrepancy between their own intended biography and priorities, and the normative notion of the ""proper"" scientist, which is strongly masculine instead of gender-neutral. Recommendations are also included for transforming this normative notion of the ""proper scientist"" -- a precondition for wider structural changes within the entire academic environment -- into a more gender-neutral one.",2019,,Higher Education: The International Journal of Higher Education Research,78,2,365-388,2461136595; EJ1222188,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-018-0347-x,,#441,Cidlinská 2019,"",""

These results suggest the ability of design-based science curricula to close the achievement and attitudinal gaps towards STEM in some student demographics. Additionally, our data revealed that continued PD can have positive effects on student attitudinal outcomes, suggesting long-term PD as an avenue to improve science education.",2019,,Journal of Science Education and Technology,28,2,104-117,2228679055; EJ1206559,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-018-9751-3,,#457,Lie 2019,"",""

Examining Teachers' Knowledge of Line Graph Task: A Case of Travel Task,"Patahuddin, Sitti Maesuri; Lowrie, Tom","Teachers should possess a robust knowledge of graph interpretation in a world that requires increasingly scientific citizens. This study aimed to investigate teachers' knowledge of interpreting a context-based line graph, by understanding the types of difficulties teachers have in interpreting such graphs. The study also sought to determine whether there were gender differences in teachers' graph interpretation skills and determine whether these interpretation skills were different among teachers with varying teaching experiences. Sixty-one teachers from ten districts in one Indonesian province participated in this study. Empirically derived items were developed to identify the teacher's conceptual understanding of line graphs with Curcio's (""Journal for Research in Mathematics Education,"" 18(5), 382-393, 1987) level of interpretation applied to explain the difficulties encountered. This study revealed that most of the teachers had difficulty answering questions that required 'reading beyond the data'. Specifically, these teachers interpreted the graph as an iconic representation of a real event rather than an abstract representation of data (i.e., speed vs. time). Performance differences in teachers' understanding of the graph were dependent on the grade level they taught, with differences especially evident in the interpretation of moderate and difficult items. There were no differences in teachers' understanding by gender or years of teaching experience. The results highlight the importance of focusing on teacher professional development centering on teachers' knowledge of graph comprehension.",2019,,International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,17,4,781-800,2228672393; EJ1207525,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10763-018-9893-z,,#459,Patahuddin 2019,"",""
VEX Robotics Competitions: Gender Differences in Student Attitudes and Experiences,"Sullivan, Amanda; Bers, Marina Umaschi","Aim/Purpose: Educational robotics competitions are a popular way to increase students' interest in science and engineering during their K-12 years. However, female students are typically underrepresented in these competitions. The goal of this study is to determine differences in the experiences of male and female robotics competition students in order to better support female students and increase their representation in competition leagues. Background: VEX Robotics Competitions are one of the fastest-growing educational robotics competitions available to middle school and high school students around the world. Despite growing numbers of participants, VEX programs have a noticeable lack of female participants. In order to create a more diverse and representative program, it is important to investigate why fewer female students participate in the competitions and what can be done to better support female students. Methodology: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from VEX mentors and students through online surveys. A total sample of N=675 VEX mentors and students participated (n=47 students and n=628 mentors). The surveys asked scaled, multiple choice, and free response questions. Through these surveys, the following research questions are answered: (1) What (if any) are the differences between male and female student experiences with VEX?; (2) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' confidence in their technical ability?; and (3) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' performance on VEX related robotics team tasks? Contribution: This study contributes to the growing body of work on engaging female students, and other underrepresented students, in STEM fields such as programming, engineering, and robotics. Findings: Results demonstrate the male students outnumber female students and male mentors also outnumber female mentors in this sample. Male students are significantly more confident in their general technical ability and their ability to put things together (p<0.05) and students of both genders generally wished to have more female students on their teams. Results also indicate that mentors generally perceive their female students as requiring more help and that they are less engaged with construction tasks as compared to male students. Recommendations for Practitioners: VEX mentors should focus on enhancing female students' confidence with the construction and building aspects of robotics and ensuring they get the same experience with these tasks as male students. They should consider providing supplemental hands-on training sessions, within or outside of regular team sessions, for students who wish to build confidence and experience in these areas. Recommendations for Researchers: Researchers should continue to explore the experiences of female students in robotics competitions, including differences based on grade level, mentor gender, and more. Researchers should additionally look at female students who are not a part of robotics teams (or who have left a robotics team) to understand why these teams do not appeal to them. Impact on Society: Women are still underrepresented in engineering and computer science professions. In order to bridge this gap, it is critical to find effective ways to reach girls in their K-12 years to build their confidence and interest in these fields before they reach college. This study points out critical areas where robotics competition teams should focus on building female students' confidence. Future Research: The findings in this paper present research from year 1 of a multi-year longitudinal study. Future research will continue to track the mentors and students in this study in order to gain information on retention and change over time.",2019,,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,18,,97-112,2228654625; EJ1204800,,,#460,Sullivan 2019,"",""

Professional Development for a Middle School Mathematics-Infused Science Curriculum,"McHugh, Luisa; Kelly, Angela M.; Burghardt, M. David","Contemporary research has suggested that for students to compete globally, pedagogy must shift to emphasize the infusion of mathematics into science instruction to strengthen understanding. Innovative professional development programs are necessary to achieve this goal, particularly with respect to teaching graphing skills in the context of science. Although there is literature to substantiate that students respond positively in terms of interest, there has been little evidence to support improved science performance when both subjects are integrated. This large-scale quasi-experimental study examined impacts of a mathematics-infused science curriculum on students' science attitudes and achievement (N =1695). Data were collected from science assessments and attitudes surveys in mathematics-infused 8th grade science classrooms and compared to those from students in non-integrated settings. Data revealed positive student outcomes, including the ability to understand mathematics-infused scientific concepts (F(1, 1693) = 17.02, p < 0.001), higher confidence in graphing, and greater agreement with the notion that mathematics is a valuable tool in learning science (F(1, 1693) = 33.76, p < 0.001). Females outperformed males in science but there were no significant differences in achievement between students from high and low needs schools. Data from a single infused unit taught within one school district (n = 136) revealed similar science achievement findings with a large effect (F(1, 134) = 37.18, p < 0.001), though gender was not a significant predictor.

A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics and independent sample t-tests. The descriptive statistics were used to identify teachers' perceptions toward Web 2.0 applications and their usage. The t-test was used to investigate the differences in perceptions between groups due to gender, and experience using computers and the Internet. The results showed that teachers have high perception toward Web 2.0 tools and services, but the extent to which they use Web 2.0 applications is somehow moderate. Moreover, no statistically significant differences in perception toward Web 2.0 were detected due to gender or experience using computers and the internet. Recommendations and suggestions for improving Web 2.0 integration into teaching and learning are proposed. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted the quantitative research approach using a questionnaire for data collection. The questionnaire was designed to investigate teachers' perceptions of using Web 2.0 applications as a method for teaching and learning purposes. Findings: The results showed high self-perception of teachers toward Web 2.0 and their use for improving students' performance, which can be attributed to their awareness of Web 2.0 importance and benefit in education. On the other hand, results indicated a low use of most of Web 2.0 tools such as microblogging, audio file sharing, photo sharing and content developing. Again, these findings can be attributed to the lack of professional training on using Web 2.0. In addition, the results did not show significant differences between male and female teachers in using Web 2.0 applications with the exception of two items. Neither did the results show any significant differences between teachers who are beginners in using computers and the internet and teachers who are advanced. This could be because beginner users of computers and the internet have the same motivation as the advances users pertaining to teaching. Originality/value: There must be an extensive training for teachers on how to use Web 2.0 tools to enhance their teaching. Infrastructure for the internet should be available so that teachers can use Web 2.0 without worrying about the technology infrastructure at their schools. More research studies should be conducted regarding the use of Web 2.0 by teachers and students alike. A qualitative and quantitative method of data collection should be used when investigating different aspects of Web 2.0.

Modification and Assessment of a Residential Summer Program for High School Women,"Cloutier, Aimee; Yew, Guo Zheng; Gupta, Siddhartha; Dissanayake, Kalpani; Monaco, Paula","The importance of reducing the gender gap in engineering programs by recruiting and retaining female students is well recognized. Although women hold roughly half of all jobs in the United States, only 24% of STEM jobs are occupied by women. The problem is even more pronounced for engineering, where women held about 12% of jobs as of 2013 (Corbett & Hill, 2015). Consequently, interactive, hands-on outreach programs are a common tool used by universities to encourage interest in engineering from K-12 students. Engineering--Get Into Real Learning (E-GIRL) is a week-long, residential summer program offered by Texas Tech University for female high school students. The primary goal of the program is to help participants make informed decisions about engineering majors and careers. To this aim, the purposes of the program are: (1) to offer a platform for female high school students to learn about the various disciplines of engineering offered at Texas Tech University and other universities; (2) to provide a realistic university experience, including coursework, social, and professional development opportunities; and (3) to provide hands-on exposure to a real-world engineering problem. E-GIRL ran for the second time in the summer of 2016, based on the favorable support it received in 2015. Primary components of this year's program were a multidisciplinary group project focused on the theme of CO2 capture and storage, as well as a series of two-hour classes taught by university faculty and graduate students in the following six engineering disciplines: chemical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This paper presents the multidisciplinary structure of the program and its connection to the project that was assigned to program participants. The curriculum structure, the in-class activities, and the method of delivery for each discipline are explained in depth. The assessment of the program's second year, including comparisons to the results from the first year and modifications to the program based on feedback from previous program participants, are discussed. Assessment was conducted through engineering skills assessment questionnaires, which required students to self-evaluate their competence in 18 skill sets before and after the program. These skill sets are qualities often identified to be important for engineers, and encompass traits associated with problem solving, project management, teamwork, and communication skills. Key results show improved self-assessment for most of the engineering skills after the program. Additionally, the skills that did not show improved self-assessment ratings after the program were consistent throughout both years. Qualitative results show a more matured and complete understanding of engineering and the individual engineering disciplines upon completion of the program. Through oral presentations, participants demonstrated in-depth engagement with the environmental conservation theme of the project. The environmental conservation theme is consistent with the participants' aspirations for considering an engineering career and championing sustainability, which was highlighted by program participants in 2015 as a desired additional focus of the program. Overall, the program provided an opportunity for participants to experience the multidisciplinary nature of engineering, aided participants' understanding of the roles of individual engineering disciplines, and furnished a realistic preview of student life in a university.

"Undergraduate Research Experiences: Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions--A Case Study at a Hispanic-Serving Institution","Rodríguez Amaya, Laura; Betancourt, Tania; Collins, Kristina Henry; Hinojosa, Orlando; Corona, Carlos","Background: Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have been proposed as means to increase the retention and engagement of minority--and more specifically Hispanic--college students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. This study explores the impact of student characteristics such as gender, classification, ethnicity, and first-generation status on UREs of STEM students through four specific constructs that current literature deem particularly important: (1) research experiences, (2) mentoring experiences, (3) awareness of research opportunities and activities, and (4) perceptions on research. These constructs are here forth referred to as Experiences, Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions. The study was conducted at a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) in Texas, United States (U.S.), where the overall increase in enrollment has been driven by growth in Hispanic student numbers, reflecting the demographic shift of the state and the nation. Results: Participants were recruited to be part of a STEM open house. Thirty-five students participated in the Undergraduate Research Experiences: Mentoring, Awareness, and Perceptions Survey (URE MAPS). This exploratory case study sought to look at student characteristics such as gender, classification, ethnicity, and first-generation status as predictors of UREs. Results show that classification and ethnicity student characteristics are statistically significant predictors of UREs. Although gender and first-generation status regression analysis did not show statistically significant results, crosstabulations looking at correlation among variables yield interesting results. Seven percent of the female respondents responded that they ""somewhat agree"" with the statement that research is a lonely activity in comparison with 23% of males. The majority (60%) of all respondents who ""strongly agreed"" with the statement that ""research is only for future scientists"" were Hispanic, indicating a need to clarify such misconceptions to encourage Hispanic student participation. Most self-identified first-generation participants, of whom 80% were female, reported awareness of faculty research activities, again pointing out gender as an important factor among students' relationship with their professors. Although less than 23% of students noted current participation in mentorship, most of those did report positive impact of this relationship on their attitude and perspective toward their major. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size and inherent bias in the characteristics of the STEM open house participants, regression analysis informed by crosstabs analysis revealed some important findings. The research suggested higher-than-expected awareness of Latinos and first-generation students of institutional research activities; however, this awareness has not translated in engagement in research activities. The data also indicates the critical need for high-impact UREs and mentorship relationships, as well as for efforts to battle student preconceptions of who can benefit from such experiences. Although this case study focused on LatinX students (LatinX is a gender-neutral term for people of Latin American heritage used in the U.S.) in the U.S., retention of historically underrepresented students in STEM disciplines is a concern shared by many countries around the world. The successful recruitment, retention, and eventual success of students in STEM degrees depend greatly on the type of pathways and support that are offered.

Mapping Changes in Support: A Longitudinal Analysis of Networks of Pre-Service Mathematics and Science Teachers,"Bokhove, Christian; Downey, Christopher","In England teachers of secondary school mathematics and science are in short supply and it is important to understand how pre-service teachers develop and maintain networks of support during their training year and the impact these networks can have on their training outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine how changes to the size and composition of these support networks during the training year are associated with programme outcomes. The paper draws on social network theory to examine the nature of the support networks that develop around each pre-service teacher, and examines how supportive ties were initiated, maintained, and broken over the course of the training year. A survey design was utilised to collect data at four time points across the 2014-2015 academic year from a total cohort of more than 75 pre-service teachers. At all four time points, participants were asked to nominate those peers and others to whom they had turned during the previous month for different aspects of support.

Factors Contributing to the Retention of Natural Mentors among Underrepresented Students across the First Year of College,"Negrete, Andrea; Griffith, Aisha N.; Hurd, Noelle M.","The current study examined characteristics of natural mentoring relationships (NMRs; i.e. mentoring relationships that develop organically with adults in one's pre-existing social network) among underrepresented college students as contributors to NMR retention across the first year of college.

Each participant could report up to five natural mentors and a total of 550 NMRs were reported. We found that more frequent contact and greater relational closeness with natural mentors during the Fall semester of mentees' first year of college increased the likelihood that NMRs were retained through the Spring semester of the first year.

The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. Compatibility, defined as the degree to which instructors perceive the CMS as being consistent with their existing values, past experiences, and current or future teaching needs, was statistically significantly associated with willingness to complete online and in-person CMS training after controlling for other factors.

Resilient Learners in Schools Serving Poor Communities,"Frempong, G.; Visser, M.; Feza, Nosisi; Winnaar, L.; Nuamah, S.","Introduction: Through the education for all initiative, a number of education systems have been able to provide access to their students at the basic education level. The major challenge is that most of these learners, especially, those from poor families who attend schools with limited resources are often not successful. However, in South Africa, quite a few of these learners succeed against all odds. We characterized these students as resilient and wonder what drives their success. Method: Our analysis employed the South Africa 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and simple descriptive statistics to profile these resilient students. TIMSS was conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The TIMSS data included information on learners' socioeconomic background characteristics, their mathematics and science achievement, and their schooling characteristics. Using these data, we were able to estimate learners' socioeconomic status that was used as a proxy of poverty. We used a crosstabulation to identify poor learners in poor schools who were successful learning mathematics and developed the characteristics of these learners. Results: Our profile indicates that a typical resilient learner is a girl who does not speak the language of classroom instruction at home. This learner tends to not only value and like mathematics but also expressed confidence about her ability to learn mathematics.

"A ""Scientific Diversity"" Intervention to Reduce Gender Bias in a Sample of Life Scientists","Moss-Racusin, Corinne A.; van der Toorn, Jojanneke; Dovidio, John F.; Brescoll, Victoria L.; Graham, Mark J.; Handelsman, Jo","Mounting experimental evidence suggests that subtle gender biases favoring men contribute to the underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including many subfields of the life sciences. However, there are relatively few evaluations of diversity interventions designed to reduce gender biases within the STEM community. Because gender biases distort the meritocratic evaluation and advancement of students, interventions targeting instructors' biases are particularly needed. We evaluated one such intervention, a workshop called ""Scientific Diversity"" that was consistent with an established framework guiding the development of diversity interventions designed to reduce biases and was administered to a sample of life science instructors (N = 126) at several sessions of the National Academies Summer Institute for Undergraduate Education held nationwide. Evidence emerged indicating the efficacy of the ""Scientific Diversity"" workshop, such that participants were more aware of gender bias, expressed less gender bias, and were more willing to engage in actions to reduce gender bias 2 weeks after participating in the intervention compared with 2 weeks before the intervention. Implications for diversity interventions aimed at reducing gender bias and broadening the participation of women in the life sciences are discussed.",2016,,CBE - Life Sciences Education,15,3,1-11,1871579945; EJ1110076,https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.15-09-0187,,#500,Moss-Racusin 2016,"",""
Determinants of Teachers' Attitudes towards E- Learning in Tanzanian Higher Learning Institutions,"Kisanga, Dalton H.","This survey research study presents the findings on determinants of teachers' attitudes towards e-learning in Tanzanian higher learning institutions.

The Benefits of Attending the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS): The Role of Research Confidence,"Casad, Bettina J.; Chang, Amy L.; Pribbenow, Christine M.","The Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) is designed to support undergraduate students' professional development as future scientists. Juniors, seniors, and postbaccalaureates who attended ABRCMS during 2008-2011 were emailed a link to an online questionnaire in which they reported their experiences at the conference. Attendees reported many ABRCMS-provided benefits. Frequency of attending or presenting at ABRCMS is positively related to science self-efficacy, research confidence, sense of belonging in science, and intentions to pursue a research degree in graduate school. Increased research confidence predicts graduate school plans and intentions for a research career in science; however, men were slightly more likely to intend to pursue a research career than women, likely due to higher research confidence. Although all attendees benefited from ABRCMS, underrepresented minority (URM) students had higher science self-efficacy and sense of belonging in science after attending ABRCMS than non-URM students. This finding demonstrates the effectiveness of ABRCMS as an intervention to increase the representation and success of URMs in science. Results highlight the importance of attending a minority-oriented research conference where URMs can develop their science self-efficacy, research confidence, and sense of belonging in science.

Assessing the First Two Years' Effectiveness of Statway®: A Multilevel Model With Propensity Score Matching,"Yamada, Hiroyuki; Bryk, Anthony S.","Objective: Statway is a community college pathways initiative developed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching designed to accelerate students' progress through their developmental math sequence to acquiring college math credit in statistics. Statway is a multifaceted change initiative designed to address the complex problems that impede student success. Specifically, it is a one-year pathway program through which students acquire college math credit. Instructors use research-based learning principles to improve the content and pedagogy for student learning and incorporate social-psychological interventions to sustain student engagement and persistence. In addition, language supports for students' accessibility to mathematics learning are integrated into the curriculum. Professional development resources assist faculty as they teach new content utilizing unfamiliar pedagogies. Statway is organized as a networked improvement community intending to accelerate educators' efforts to continuously improve. This study was aimed to assess the effectiveness of Statway during its first two years of implementation. Method: We applied a multilevel model with propensity score matching to control for possible selection bias and increase the validity of causal inference. Results: We found large effects of Statway on students attaining college math credit with persisting effects into the following year as Statway students also accumulated more college-level credits. These improved outcomes emerged for each gender and race/ethnicity groups and for students with different math placement levels. Conclusion: This study provided robust evidence that Statway increases student success in acquiring college math credit and enhances equity in student outcomes.

Factors Associated with College Coping among High Achieving Scholarship Recipients from Adverse Backgrounds,"Wolniak, Gregory C.; Rekoutis, Panagiotis","Background/Context: Studies have shown that students from low-income backgrounds are particularly at risk of not succeeding in college and that, once in college, students from the lowest socioeconomic groups complete college at a fraction the rate of student from the highest socioeconomic groups. College presents unique challenges for students from adverse backgrounds. To adequately support such students in college, we must first understand the kinds of programs and support services that enable students from adverse backgrounds to cope with stressors encountered during college. Purpose /Objective: The purpose of the study was to improve understanding of the factors that enable students from adverse backgrounds to cope with the college environment in pursuit of a bachelor's degree. The analyses addressed the following research questions: (1) Among students from adverse backgrounds, do the services and supports encountered during college enhance their ability to positively cope with the college environment? (2) Are the associations between college services and supports, and positively coping with the college environment conditional on gender, identifying as a student of color, year in college, or level of adversity experienced prior to college? Research Design: The study utilized multivariate regression techniques to analyze survey data. The first analytic stage involved regressing each of the three Coping with the College Environment Scales on distinct blocks of variables. The second analytic stage tested for conditional effects by gender, identifying as a student of color, the number of adversities experienced prior to college, and HAA Scholarship application year as a proxy for year of initial college entry. Conclusions/Recommendations: The study's main findings include: having a mentor while in college as well as during high school had a positive influence on college coping; self-efficacy significantly and positively influenced all three dimensions of coping with the college environment; and several relationships differed between females (vs. males) and first-year (vs. other) students. Overall, the study responds to calls for additional research in this arena, builds on the literature on college coping, readiness and success, and extends previous validation research on dimensions of coping with college through analysis of a robust sample of college students. The study reaffirms the importance of college scholarship programs in providing researchers a lens through which to study and learn from unique populations of students.",2016,,Teachers College Record,118,1,,1773216329; EJ1086274,,,#525,Wolniak 2016,"",""
Perceptions about the Role of Race in the Job Acquisition Process: At the Nexus of Attributional Ambiguity and Aversive Racism in Technology and Engineering Education,"Niemann, Yolanda Flores; Sánchez, Nydia C.","This study explored the role of race in the negative job acquisition outcomes of African American graduates of a federally funded multi-institution doctoral training program. Because the credentials of African American graduates were similar, equal to, and/or, in some cases, exceeded those of their white peers, qualifications were ruled out as contributing to negative job outcomes. Further examination indicated that among the likely factors accounting for job acquisition outcomes were: tokenism; aversive racism; microaggressions; and inadequate professional development for graduates entering a White-male-dominated field. Recommendations for practice suggest amending graduate programming to include anticipatory socialization relative to being a member of a historically underrepresented group in the field, and mentorship that can help diffuse the impacts of tokenism and facilitate career success in academia.",2015,,Journal of Technology Education,27,1,41-55,1826518177; EJ1087889,,,#526,Niemann 2015,"",""

This quasi-experimental study evaluated the longitudinal effects of a 3-year, school-based, health promotion intervention (i.e. nutrition and physical education, classroom physical activity, professional development and health promotion for teachers and families, and strengthening wellness policies and family/community partnerships) on children's health behaviors in four, rural, low-socioeconomic status elementary schools. A total of 999 kindergarten to third-grade children participated in data collection consisting of 4-day pedometer tracking and previous-day fruits and vegetables consumption recall from baseline in January, 2011 through 12 follow-up assessments ending May, 2013. The mixed-effects regression models showed that children's nutrition and physical activity behaviors significantly improved over the 3-year intervention. The percentages of children who met the nutrition recommendation increased from 11 to 23% for girls and 12 to 23% for boys, while the percent who met the physical activity recommendation increased from 1 to 16% for girls and 3 to 7% for boys.

Girls and Computing: Female Participation in Computing in Schools,"Zagami, Jason; Boden, Marie; Keane, Therese; Moreton, Bronwyn; Schulz, Karsten","Computer education, with a focus on Computer Science, has become a core subject in the Australian Curriculum and the focus of national innovation initiatives. Equal participation by girls, however, remains unlikely based on their engagement with computing in recent decades. In seeking to understand why this may be the case, a Delphi consensus process was conducted using a wide range of experts from industry and academia to explore existing research and interventions, recommending four key approaches: engaging girls in the Digital Technologies curriculum; addressing parental preconceptions and influences; providing positive role models and mentors; and supporting code clubs for girls. Unfortunately, all of these approaches have been widely implemented, and while individually successful at the scale of their implementation, have failed to systemically improve female participation in computing. The only discernible difference between initiatives to improve female participation in computing and the successful approaches in other fields such as science, has been the availability of a compulsory developmental curriculum beginning from the start of school, and it is this that may provide a scaffold that sustains female engagement over critical periods such as adolescence, when participation in computing begins to dramatically decline.",2015,,Australian Educational Computing,30,2,1-14,1773225596; EJ1084644,,,#529,Zagami 2015,"",""

ADVANCing the Agenda for Gender Equity,"Laursen, Sandra L.; Austin, Ann E.; Soto, Melissa; Martinez, Dalinda","In recent years, women's representation in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has grown at the undergraduate level, with STEM degrees earned by US women reaching parity in some fields and making notable progress in others. Yet the faculty with whom these undergraduates interact in classes and labs are much less diverse: Across the STEM fields, women represent only a third of US faculty. A STEM workforce that does not match the nation's demographics means the nation is not discovering and developing all the available scientific talent that can help to solve important global problems. So how can universities create environments that support the success of women scholars in STEM disciplines? Increasing the representation and involvement of STEM academic women requires not only efforts to support the aspirations, advancement, and success of individual women but also system-wide efforts to identify and remove organizational constraints that lead to gender biases in institutional policies and processes. This need for a system-wide approach is the premise of the US National Science Foundation's ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) program, as well as similar efforts in other countries. This study examines the work and experiences of ADVANCE IT grantees as examples of institutions that have tackled these problems in a systemic fashion and achieved some success. The authors examined the approaches to organizational change taken by these institutions, focusing on the following questions: (1) What strategies have been used to create institutional environments that encourage the success of women scholars? (2) Which strategies work and which don't? Why? and (3) What strategies should be included in a change plan?

It also discusses the evidence used to support the development of the resources, the support provided for teachers and parents and an initial evaluation following their use. Design/methodology/approach: Tyfu i Fyny/Growing Up are interactive bi-lingual (Welsh and English) SRE teaching resources for primary schools suitable for students aged five to 12 years. These resources comprise of two components, an interactive electronic web-based programme and a floor mat illustrating a naked boy and girl. The electronic web-based programme is used to introduce puberty changes, loving relationships, conception, pregnancy and birth and is suitable for students aged nine to 12 years. The floor mat is suitable to be used with students aged between five and 12 years. Teaching activities can include naming body parts, discussing gender differences, personal safety, distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate touching, discussing puberty changes and other health promotion activities as well as delivering aspects of the National Curriculum for Wales. Findings: The results from the initial evaluation undertaken with year six students and teachers demonstrates how the resources have impacted on the teaching and learning experiences of primary teachers and students. It also demonstrates how the teacher training sessions and using the Tyfu i Fyny/Growing Up resources have increased teachers' confidence in delivering SRE.

Method: A phenomenological case-study approach incorporating interviews, both individual and focus group, and journals served to obtain participants' perspectives. Traditional data analysis, coding, thematic category development, and interpretation techniques were used. Results: Participants provided critical experiences, enlightening perspectives, and specific recommendations regarding their socialization into the kinesiology academic field and profession. Four major thematic categories were derived from the data: (a) ""transition,"" when participants highlighted professional, academic, or personal shifts in perspectives occurring during studies; (b) ""negotiation,"" when participants pointed out experiences when significant consideration was given to the consequences, risk, and rewards of formal and informal interactions with peers, faculty, and administrators; (c) ""balance,"" during which participants described their struggles and successes with meeting academic, professional, and personal obligations; and (d) ""support,"" when participants identified emotional, financial, and professional resources that impacted their socialization.

Gender Dynamics in the Identification Process of Mentoring Relationships: An Empirical Investigation,"Abbas, Muhammad; Bajwa, Sami Ullah; Shahzad, Faisal; Rasheed, Muhammad Athar","This study brings a novel dimension to mentoring theory by exploring the relatively unexamined aspect of cross-gender infatuation between mentors and mentees. At the heart of the mentoring relationship, according to this study, lies personal identification, which is characterized by feelings of connectedness, belonging, and a strong desire to forge a relationship. To examine into this topic, the study employed phenomenological methods, conducting thorough interviews with a balanced group of 20 participants. This group included five male mentors, five male mentees, five female mentors, and five female mentees. The data gathered from these interviews were meticulously analyzed using first and second cycle coding techniques, and the findings are articulated through a process model. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, the study posits that gender differences play a crucial role in the process of personal identification within mentoring relationships. It examines situations where infatuation, driven by sexual desires, arises in one or both parties involved. The study discusses how societal gender norms often compel individuals to suppress these intimate desires. This suppression and avoidance can lead to sexual repression, manifesting as disruptive behavior and hindering the development of personal identification.

Assessing the Professional Development of Sexual Minority Graduate Students in the Sciences through a National Survey,"Platt, Lisa F; Scheitle, Christopher P; Dabbs Ellory","Studies suggest that sexual minority individuals in the sciences face challenges resulting from a heteronormative climate. Many of these studies have relied on data collected using non-representative methods that make it difficult to generalize findings or data that do not allow for comparisons to heterosexual individuals. This study presents data from an original, nationally representative survey of graduate students in the United States in five natural and social science disciplines: biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and sociology. The analyses find that students identifying with an ‘other’ sexual identity (e.g., queer, pansexual, asexual) report worse advisor relationships and a weaker sense of belonging in their science discipline as compared to heterosexual students. Gay or lesbian students report weaker identities as scientists compared to heterosexual students, but no differences are found in sexual minority students’ confidence in completing tasks related to science.

"It’s Not You, It’s Me: An Exploration of Mentoring Experiences for Women in STEM","Saffie-Robertson, Ma Carolina","Although the number of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) continues to grow, men still represent a significant majority of those employed in these industries. Mentoring programs have been identified as a useful tool to alleviate this gap and therefore have been developed in an effort to attract and retain women in STEM. However, research suggests that women are still being mentored less often than their male colleagues. To understand this issue in depth, 36 women holding managerial positions in STEM organizations in the United States and Canada were interviewed and their experiences with mentoring were discussed. The results suggest that women do have access and indeed find potential mentors but they perceive significant barriers that prevent these initial meetings from developing into long-term mentoring relationships. Specifically, four Barriers to the Development of Mentorship (BDM) were identified including: Need for Fit, Demonstrating Capability, Commitment of the Mentor, and Trust in the Mentor. BDM might help researchers and practitioners understand why women are under-mentored and consequently underrepresented in STEM workplaces. Implications of these findings are discussed, such as how to improve formal mentoring programs to overcome BDM and better serve women in STEM.",2020,,Sex Roles,83,9-10,566-579,2628406006,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-020-01129-x,,#548,Saffie-Robertson 2020,"",""
Exploring a Women-Only Training Program for Coach Developers,"Kraft, Erin; Culver, Diane M; Din, Cari","The following practice paper introduces an innovative women-only training program for coach developers in a Canadian provincial sport organization. The dearth of women in coaching and sport leadership positions informs the program as a whole and the participant perspectives on what is working, in practice, for them specifically in a way that could support future sport leaders interested in increasing gender equity in their sport organizations and leadership skills in their female leaders. The aims of the coach developer program are two-fold: to promote women in leadership and to create a social learning space for women to connect and support each other in their leadership development. The purpose of this practice paper is to discuss the supports that have enabled the facilitation of this program and to explore the value of a women-only training program. Two women (out of a total of 10) participating in the program and two leads facilitating the program were interviewed for their perspectives. The lessons learned touch on the types of value that were created (immediate, potential, and applied) and the specific supports (micro, meso, and macro) that enabled the facilitation of the program.

Identifying the barriers that STEM women face to progress their careers remains an important area of research. While previous studies have explored some of challenges associated with the gendered culture within higher education, less is known about the additional barriers faced by women with children. Using a survey of STEM women in the UK this study examines the influence motherhood has on women's perceptions of organisational support, mentoring and networking and identifies that STEM women with children are found to have less opportunity to engage with mentoring or to benefit from formal or informal networks within the institution.

"‘There’s a perfect way to do things, and there’s a real way to do things’: Attitudes, beliefs and practices of strength and conditioning coaches in elite international women's rugby union","Nolan, David; Horgan, Peter; MacNamara, Aine; Egan, Brendan","Optimal physical performance is a product of specific and tailored training. There are well-established sex differences in anatomical, physiological, and performance factors between biological males and females, which may have implications for physical preparation. A potential knowledge gap exists in relation to sex-specific differences in physical preparation because practitioners largely rely upon empirical evidence collected in male subjects for reference when devising interventions for female athletes. Therefore, this study explored the attitudes, beliefs and practices of strength and conditioning coaches (n = 8; M/F, 6/2) in elite level (international) women's rugby union using semi-structured interviews (mean ± standard deviation duration 59 ± 15 minutes). The interviews explored differences in coaching elite female rugby players compared to males, with specific focus on training methodologies and understanding of pertinent aspects of female physiology. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilised to generate a rich qualitative dataset. Analysis resulted in the identification of higher-order themes: developmental stage of women's rugby, physical preparation, and education. Additional subthemes were created to facilitate organisation and presentation of data. The majority of coaches consider sex-specificity when devising physical preparation interventions as a function of training experience, rather than physiological between-sex differences, yet there were conflicting, and often erroneous understanding of female-specific considerations. To the authors knowledge, this is the first study to investigate attitudes, beliefs, and practices in elite level strength and conditioning coaches regarding sex-specific differences, and as such, illustrates the current understanding and opinions of practitioners in international level women's rugby union.

"Addressing the gender politics of equity work in schools: The significance of affinity, criticality and mentorship","Keddie, Amanda","The gender politics of the current moment have revitalized forms of feminism and anti-feminism. New collective engagements reflect both the power and problematics of group identity politics to, on the one hand, mobilize political resistance in struggles for gender justice but, on the other hand, homogenize and alienate ‘others’. Mindful of these issues, this paper examines the group identity politics of the equity-focused clubs at an elite independent school in the USA. Drawing on interview data from 16 student leaders, the paper considers the gender dynamics within these clubs that both supported and undermined gender justice. The focus is on the polarizing of gender produced by the clubs that positioned equity as a minority issue, stigmatized homosexuality and presumed boys to be non-caring and not interested in equity. It is also on the school’s approaches to disrupting this polarization through teacher mentorship and critical discussion. In terms of addressing issues of gender justice, the paper highlights the significance of students being able to access such mentorship and critical discussion within a variety of spaces that support them to be heard and reflect their commonality of experience.

How men can excel as mentors of women,"Bickel, Janet","Most male professionals have more experience mentoring men than they do mentoring women, and their male mentees progress further than their female mentees. Yet, in academic medicine, men have few forums in which to discuss the gender related issues that they encounter. To address the gender-related questions that commonly arise, the author of this commentary offers perspectives and recommendations, consolidated from over 25 years of experience leading career and talent development programs, to assist men in successfully mentoring women. Her recommendations are organized around three questions: (1) How do women’s and men’s experiences in mentoring relationships tend to differ? (2) What interferes with the accurate evaluation of women’s skills? and (3) Is the current generation of female trainees still at a gender-related disadvantage? She argues that men’s ability to effectively mentor women depends to a great extent on their understanding of the challenges that women disproportionately face in developing their careers. Mentors who are skilled in adapting to the gender related needs of mentees will contribute to women’s retention and development in academic medicine, enhance the leadership capacity of their organizations and the profession, and extend their own legacies.

'It's always the bare minimum' - A qualitative study of players' experiences of tackle coaching in women's rugby union,"Dane, Kathryn; Foley, Geraldine; Hendricks, Sharief; Wilson, Fiona","Objectives: Tackle coaching forms a cornerstone of training in rugby and is designed to enhance performance and mitigate tackle injury. The athlete voice can help key stakeholders understand the psychosocial determinants that shape skill development in relation to tackle coaching. We aimed to capture player experiences of tackle coaching in women's rugby union. Design: Qualitative study using the grounded theory approach. Methods: Current women rugby union players, with at least 1-year senior level experience, were recruited from Europe, Africa and North America between December 2021 and March 2022 to participate in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed in line with grounded theory coding procedures. Results: The 21 players were aged 20–48 years with a mean 10.6 years of rugby playing experience. Analysis revealed that the experiences of tackle coaching that shaped women's tackle skill development and sense of preparedness ranged from constraining to empowering, and gender was a pivotal influence in creating meaning. Participants expected and accepted the bare minimum in tackle coaching as the price that they had to pay for inclusion in rugby. Conclusions: Participants' experiences of tackle coaching were entangled in inequitable club structures and cultures where men's rugby is the norm. Empowering tackle coaching in women's rugby union must be bespoke to the given context and the needs of women players.

Along with everybody else, coaches found themselves constrained to an at-home self-isolation, which limited their ability to normally engage with their profession and to interact with their athletes. This situation may also have impacted their own psychological well-being. With this study, we explored coaches’ perceptions of stress in relation to their emotion regulation strategies depending upon their gender and competitive level (elite vs. non-elite). A sample of 2272 Italian coaches were surveyed during the period of lockdown. Mean values for perceived stress and emotion regulation strategies were compared to normative data of the two instruments as reported in the original studies. Furthermore, two Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were completed to observe the potential differences in the coaches’ emotion regulation strategies and perception of stress. Finally, a blockwise regression analysis was run to assess how coaches’ emotion regulation strategies impacted upon their perception of stress. Both women and men reported higher levels of perceived stress than those reported in the normative data. Similarly, average scores for emotion regulation strategies were significantly different from those reported for normative data, in particular, coaches reported slightly higher use of emotion regulation strategies than participants in the original study. Significant gender-based differences emerged in terms of emotional regulations, with men adopting more suppression than women. No differences by competitive level were found. In terms of perceived stress, male coaches and elite coaches showed to be more in control of the situation (positive stress) than female coaches and non-elite coaches, respectively, while women experienced more negative stress than men. The blockwise regression evidenced how reappraisal resulted to be predictive in helping coaches to reduce their perception of stress, while suppression predicted higher stress perceptions.

Methods: A cross-sectional 27-item online survey was conducted with psychiatrists and psychiatric trainee members of the European Psychiatric Association. Results: A total of 561 psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees from 35 European countries participated representing a response rate of 52.8% for women and 17.7% for men from a total sample of 1,580. The specific challenges that women face in their professional development fall into two categories. One comprised women’s negative attitudes concerning their abilities in self-promotion and networking. The other identified environmental barriers related to lack of opportunity and support and gender discrimination.

A total of 327 undergraduate students volunteered to participate in this study, which included 16 weeks of lectures aimed at developing CT. The effects of SNS-based e-mentoring on CT development, the influences of each e-mentoring activity on CT development, and gender differences were analyzed using data on participants’ CT assistance scores and their utilization of e-mentoring activities.

To ensure the completeness of our search results, we engaged in snowballing and an expert-based search to identify additional studies of interest. Finally, data were collected from each study to address the research questions outlined above. Results: Using the methods outlined above, we identified 16 empirical studies, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies informed by a range of theoretical frameworks. Based on data collected from the primary studies in our sample, we identified 13 persistence factors across four categories: (I) social capital, networking, & support; (II) career & professional development; (III) pedagogical & programmatic interventions; and (IV) exposure & access. This data-collection process also yielded 26 recommendations across six stakeholder groups: (i) researchers; (ii) colleges and universities; (iii) the computing industry; (iv) K-12 systems and schools; (v) governments; and (vi) parents. Conclusion: This systematic mapping study resulted in the identification of numerous persistence factors for Black students in CS. Crucially, however, these persistence factors allow Black students to persist, but not thrive, in CS. Accordingly, we contend that more needs to be done to address the systemic inequities faced by Black people in general, and Black women in particular, in computing programs and professions. As evidenced by the relatively small number of primary studies captured by this systematic mapping study, there exists an urgent need for additional, asset-based empirical studies involving Black students in CS. In addition to foregrounding the intersectional experiences of Black women in CS, future studies should attend to the currently understudied experiences of Black men.",2023,12/,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,23,4,40 (42 pp.),,10.1145/3617896,,#573,Belle 2023,"",""
Participation pathways for women into university makerspaces,"Tomko, M.; Aleman, M.W.; Newstetter, W.; Nagel, R.L.; Linsey, J.","Background: Engineering education has observed considerable growth in academic makerspaces with initial data indicating significant potential for makerspaces to support learning. Purpose/Hypothesis: Given gender disparities in engineering as a professional community of practice (CoP) and indications for makerspaces as sites for learning, educational researchers need to forge a better understanding of women's pathways into makerspaces, including the barriers that inhibit and the catalysts that broaden participation. Design/Method: This study employed qualitative interviews with 20 women students who were identified as makers in order to gain insights into the characteristics of their pathways into university makerspaces. Results: Using grounded theory development, four major aspects of students' pathways emerged: (1) early forms of apprenticeship through mentors; (2) overcoming and resisting limiting gendered expectations imposed by others in early experiences in unfamiliar makerspace CoPs, resulting in failed articulations of related communities; (3) successful articulations of community grounded in making-centered coursework and personal passions; and (4) relationships in college that expanded access, leadership, and visibility toward fuller participation in makerspace CoPs. Conclusion: Educational interventions to broaden women's participation in makerspaces must be multipronged and attend to early childhood experiences, include supportive opportunities for women to participate in making in K-12 and university curricula, expand definitions of making to legitimize the arts and crafts as part of design, and create apprenticeship opportunities for women to mentor women in makerspaces. We must change the narrative of who makers are, what making is, and who belongs in makerspaces to reduce barriers and create inclusive making communities. © 2021 ASEE.",2021,/,Journal of Engineering Education,110,3,700-17,,10.1002/jee.20402,,#575,Tomko 2021,"",""
Undergraduate physics students' experiences: Exploring the impact of underrepresented identities and intersectionality,"Keblbeck, D.K.; Piatek-Jimenez, K.; Medina Medina, C.","Historically, physics has been a predominantly male field, with previous literature showing that there is little diversity among U.S. physics students at the undergraduate and graduate levels or among physicists within the work force. Recent research indicates that the lack of diversity in physics is partially due to an unwelcoming climate within physics departments, as well as differential experiences during college. Most physics education research that addresses the lack of underrepresented identities within the field has focused on the identities of women and people of color. There has been little research to investigate people with multiple underrepresented identities, including those such as socioeconomic status, first-generation college students, or learning disabilities. Furthermore, there has been even less research conducted to better understand the impacts of the intersection of these underrepresented identities and how it relates to experiences when pursuing a physics major. In order to address this gap in the literature, our research project has investigated undergraduate physics students' experiences to better understand what factors affect their experiences and how these may differ by the intersection of one's underrepresented identities. In particular, we explored how these identities impact their experiences as a physics major. To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with physics majors at one university to learn more about their college experiences regarding physics. Our findings suggest that there is a disproportionate number of obstacles when pursuing a physics major faced by those with a greater number of underrepresented identities. We conclude that there is a need for more equitable pedagogical practices and departmental policies within the undergraduate physics experience, in addition to a more ""human"" approach to mentorship, in order to foster an environment in which students with underrepresented identities can feel supported and thrive academically and professionally. In particular, we believe that dedicated formal pedagogical trainings that teach diverse teaching skills to accommodate students with different learning styles would be useful to many university physics instructors. This type of formal training would include annual workshops designed to educate faculty on how curriculum, pedagogy, and departmental practices can be altered to be more inclusive with the intent to ensure a more equitable and welcoming experience for all students. Additionally, incorporating mentorship programs that focus on a more individualized and natural support system would likely benefit all students, especially those with underrepresented identities, by creating a more welcoming and inclusive space within physics departments.",2024,/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,20,2,020120 (17 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.020120,,#577,Keblbeck 2024,"",""
Perspectives on the contributions of women to the hydrologic sciences and their changing demographics at USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges,"Rustad, Lindsey; Adams, Mary Beth; Dymond, Salli F.; Gregory, Margaret; Miniat, Chelcy F.","The increase in the frequency and severity of water crises around the world necessitates maintaining or augmenting investments in the hydrologic sciences, including in a trained, diverse workforce. The USDA Forest Service operates a network of 85 Experimental Forests and Ranges, Experimental Watersheds, and cooperating sites (EFRs), 31 of which include long-term hydrologic studies (HydroEFRs). The HydroEFRs are centers for hydrologic science and education and play a key role informing watershed policy and management. The goals of this study were to understand (1) how, broadly, the women associated with the HydroEFRs (including women in the Forest Service workforce and women with cooperating agencies or universities who have worked at HydroEFRs) have contributed to hydrologic sciences and (2) how, more specifically, the number and roles of women in the Forest Service workforce associated with the HydroEFRs have changed over time. Data were collected from the EFR Data Explorer, the USDA Forest Service Human Resources Management (HRM) Data Metrics and Analysis Team (DMAT), literature reviews, and questionnaires to USDA EFR scientists-in-charge and to women who were or had been involved in hydrologic sciences at EFRs. Results showed that women associated with the HydroEFRs have made significant contributions to the hydrologic sciences, including authoring or co-authoring over 3,000 publications, with over 170,000 citations since 1977 and an H-index of 181. In their own words, the women indicated that they were also active in contributing to hydrologic fieldwork, providing stewardship for long-term data, and contributing to the social capital of the HydroEFRs through teamwork, collaboration, and mentoring. For the Forest Service, trends in employment records from 1992 through 2021 showed a 55% contraction of the entire FS R&D workforce, including a 59% loss in the number of women in the FS R&D workforce, a 50% loss in the number of women associated with HydroEFR duty stations, and a 26% loss in the number of women in hydrology positions. During this period, there was a greater loss of both women and men in lower-graded positions relative to higher-graded positions in the FS R&D workforce, with serial implications for the ability of the workforce to collect data, produce basic science publications, and conduct syntheses. Although the ratio of women:men declined across the Forest Service and FS R&D, the ratio of women:men increased at the HydroEFRs (driven by a higher ratio of women:men at higher grade levels) and for management positions within FS R&D and at the HydroEFRs.When asked, women valued their contributions to the hydrologic sciences and envisioned a more equitable future for women in hydrology. Overall, results show that HydroEFRs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences, who, in turn, have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long-term research sites. As water crises around the world continue to escalate, building a strong, diverse workforce in the hydrologic sciences and supporting the places where they can conduct their research is important. © 2023",2023,,Journal of Hydrology,621,,,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129469,,#578,Rustad 2023,"",""
Women and men in the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine: workforce survey,"Bezak, Eva; Suchowerska, Roksolana; Claridge Mackonis, Elizabeth; Pillen, Heath; Ralston, Anna; Haworth, Annette; Suchowerska, Natalka","A survey was designed to determine aspirations, motivations and workplace experiences of both female and male members of the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). The survey collected both quantitate and qualitative data, including open ended questions. This paper reports the survey’s qualitative results. The research was approved by Ethics at University of South Australia and endorsed by ACPSEM. All 205 women (30% of total membership) and 440 men were invited to complete the survey online. The data for the qualitative analysis were responses to open-ended questions within the survey. 102 women and 150 men completed surveys were received, with 66 surveys analysed, before data saturation was reached. The survey revealed a number of themes that reflect concerns and opportunities identifying the direction for improving work-life balance and gender equity within the medical physics profession in Australasia. Issues around managing challenging workloads and professional development were amplified for women with children and child-rearing responsibilities, directly contributing to a reduction in work capacity and a reorientation of work-life priorities. The survey provides direction for strategies to improve work-life balance and enable equitable engagement in the profession. The first is to identify and develop role models that actively model successful work-life balance and flexibility in gender roles and in professional conduct. The second is to improve the management skills of current and emerging administrators, advocating for improved work conditions for medical physics professionals at an organisation level. Finally, efforts need to be made to establish flexible professional development and career progression opportunities amongst those that are unable to commit to large workloads, which is common for those with child-rearing responsibilities. The realisation of these strategic goals will reduce the identified barriers to full female participation in the workforce, and shift gender-based subcultures within the workplace. © 2018, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2019,,Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,42,1,33-41,,10.1007/s13246-018-0706-z,,#579,Bezak 2019,"",""

Findings In comparison to male participants, female I-Corps participants reported less entrepreneurial experience prior to the program, poorer team relationships during the program and lower entrepreneurial intention and technology commercialization readiness at both the beginning and the end of the program. However, no gender differences were found in positive or negative perceptions of the instructional climate or perceptions of program usefulness. Originality/value This study is unique as it is based on a large-scale dataset drawn from sites across the United States. The results support potential changes to I-Corps and similar programs, including providing more explicit instructions for tasks with which female participants have less prior experience than males (e.g. in applying for patents), offering guidance for team interactions, and providing mentorship to assess whether low self-efficacy is leading women to underestimate the potential success of their projects.",2022,/,International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship,14,1,117-41,,10.1108/IJGE-10-2020-0166,,#580,Epstein 2022,"",""

What we can learn from elite academic staff publication portfolios: a social network analysis,"Grant, M.J.; Lotto, R.R.; Jones, I.D.","Purpose- The study aims to construct an understanding of professional academic writing network structures to inform organisational strategic investment in academic staff development. Design/methodology/approach - Longitudinal social network analysis is used to examine the personalnetworks evident in the publication portfolios of a purposive sample of four international academics across each quartile of the SCOPUS defined area of General Nursing’s top 100 authors. Findings - Trends in the publication portfolios of elite academics across gender, sector and geographic location are presented. In the first years of successful writing for publication, authors collaborate within a single highly connected co-author network. This network will typically expand to include new co-authors, before additional separate co-author collaborations emerge (threeto fouryears). Authors experience steady growth in co-author numbers fourto sevenyears from first co-authored publication. After a period of rapid expansion, these collaborations coalesce into a smaller number of highly connected groups (eightto tenyears). Most collaborations occur within the higher education sector and across multiple disciplines including medicine, social sciences and psychology. Male co-authors are disproportionately represented in what is a predominantly female profession. Practical implications - The development of extended co-author networks, locally, internationally and across the higher education sector, enable authors to attain the marker of achievement required by universities and government funding bodies, namely sustained output of academic publications. Identified trends support the inclusion of investment in academic time and resources in higher education institutions strategic and operational plans to enable academic staff to develop interdisciplinary professional networks. In focussing this investment on gender equality, female academics will experience parity of opportunity in achieving their organisational and personal goals relating to professional academic writing. Medium-term investment may be required before the impact of that investment becomes apparent.

Undergraduate Engineering Students’ Understanding of Engineering Disciplines: An Empirical Study,"Onal, Sinan; Temko, Ezra","This study investigates the perceived familiarity with different engineering disciplines among engineering students at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville (SIUE), with a focus on disparities across gender, race, and academic majors. Data were collected via an online Qualtrics survey from undergraduate engineering students at SIUE during the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters. The survey, which achieved a 25% response rate with 275 completed surveys, assessed students’ ability to identify six key engineering disciplines. Quantitative analysis methods, including linear regression and multivariate analysis, were applied to examine how demographic factors influence students’ familiarity and identification skills. Weighted data were used in the analysis to correct for non-response bias related to gender, race, and major selection. Findings indicate notable disparities: male and White students exhibited higher familiarity compared to Female and Gender Queer (FGQ) students and students of color, especially Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. Students enrolled in broad-based and interdisciplinary engineering programs demonstrated better overall understanding than their peers in more specialized programs. The study confirms that perceived familiarity significantly predicts correct identification, suggesting that increased educational exposure to various engineering fields can enhance accuracy. These results underscore the importance of revising educational curricula to include more inclusive and comprehensive exposure to all engineering disciplines. Interventions such as redesigned coursework, expanded mentorship programs, and increased support for underrepresented groups are recommended to address the observed disparities. Future research should aim to validate these interventions and explore longitudinal trends in engineering education familiarity. © 2024 TEMPUS Publications.",2024,,International Journal of Engineering Education,40,5,1129-1149,,,,#587,Onal 2024,"",""

The slight influence on the career choice of women to pursue ICT derives from everyday use of computers and career information provided by role models and mentors, which are atypical, while, those women who did not choose a career in ICT did so because of their perception of the overabundance of required programming skills. Other barriers include environmental working conditions, infrastructure and electricity in the work area needed to support ICT related work.

“Simply the best”: Professors nominated by students for their exemplary technology practices in teaching,"Jorgensen, M.; Havel, A.; Fichten, C.; King, L.; Marcil, E.; Lussier, A.; Budd, J.; Vitouchanskaia, C.","Our goal was to explore the technology related pedagogical practices of college professors deemed by their students to be excellent in using technology in their teaching. We explored the views of 114 community/junior college professors who were nominated by their students as excellent in using technology in their teaching using both questionnaires and interview methods. Results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show no gender or years teaching in college differences in professors’ self rated proficiency or comfort with technologies. Results also show that most professors taught themselves how to use technologies with the help of online resources, through trial and error, and with help from colleagues and support staff. Challenges using technology were related primarily to technical problems, such as technologies not working and the institution’s computers and networks being slow. However, professors in our sample usually had a back-up plan and found ways to carry on even if the technology failed. Our findings report on the most and least frequently used technologies in face-to-face teaching, on how professors typically used the course management system, on how professors communicate with students, including the very small number who used social media to do this, and the likelihood of allowing students to use their personal mobile technology in class.

The Underrepresentation of Women in Computing Fields: A Synthesis of Literature Using a Life Course Perspective,"Main, J.B.; Schimpf, C.","Using a life course perspective, this literature review synthesizes research on women’s underrepresentation in computing fields across four life stages: 1) pre-high school; 2) high school; 3) college major choice and persistence; and 4) post-baccalaureate employment. Issues associated with access to, and use of, computing resources at the pre-high school and high school levels are associated with gender differences in interest and attitudes toward computing. At the college level, environmental context (classroom design, interactions with peers and role models, signals from stereotypical images) contribute to whether students will major in computing, whereas psychosocial factors (e.g., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) and departmental culture play a role in persistence in computing fields. As in other fields, issues associated with work-life conflict, occupational culture, and mentoring/networking opportunities play a role in women’s participation in the computing workforce. Several initiatives and programs have been implemented to address women’s underrepresentation in computing fields. While great strides have been made in making computing more accessible, the life course perspective highlights the importance of longitudinal studies in identifying students’ pathways to and through computing fields, as well as how interventions across life stages may intersect or cumulate to generate trends in computing participation.",2017,11/,IEEE Transactions on Education,60,4,296-304,,10.1109/TE.2017.2704060,,#596,Main 2017,"",""
Research of the college coaches evaluation index system based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model,"Chen, Jing Fei; Yang, Aimin; Zhou, Xin; Yan, Longge","In order to know how to choose the best college coach or coaches, a mathematic model will be built in this paper.

Exploring factors affecting academics’ adoption of emerging mobile technologies-an extended UTAUT perspective,"Hu, S.; Laxman, K.; Lee, K.","With the proliferation of technology and the Internet, the way education is delivered has undergone a rapid change in different educational settings. Whilst a large amount of research has investigated the implementation of mobile technologies in education, there is still a paucity of research from a teaching perspective across disciplines within higher education. For this reason, this study investigated the acceptance, preparedness and adoption of mobile technologies by academic faculties within higher education, using the context of China. Underpinned by the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Model, a large-scale quantitative survey investigated the factors affecting academics’ behavioural intentions and use for mobile technologies, and variations between different demographic groups. Findings suggested that the most significant factors affecting academics’ behavioural intention and behaviours of use were their performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and habit. Behavioural intention also affected how the faculty staff used their mobile technologies. Moreover, gender, age, teaching experience and discipline were found to be moderating factors.

Whether to flip Extreme Apprenticeship: which is more effective in programming instruction?,"Hopcan, S.; Polat, E.; Albayrak, E.","Programming knowledge is more important than ever in the digital world. However, teaching programming can be challenging, especially with novice learners. Considerable research has been conducted into the most effective methods for teaching programming. Extreme apprenticeship, a variation of cognitive apprenticeship, is a method that has been used in teaching programming at university level in recent years. Because this method focuses particularly on completing lots of exercises with coaching and guidance, it may solve many problems related to learning programming. Flipped learning can be useful for student preparedness and providing sufficient theoretical knowledge at the beginning of the course. This study compares the applications of the extreme apprenticeship method, flipped extreme apprenticeship, and traditional classroom, analyzing them at the university level in terms of their effects on academic achievement and engagement coupled with gender differences. The findings of the study indicate that the extreme apprenticeship and flipped extreme apprenticeship instructional methods improve academic achievement and student engagement in introductory programming more than the traditional method.

Analysis on the difference of college teachers' professional pressure and strategies to improve teachers' mental health under the expectancy theory,"Xiao Liang; Bautista, O.O.","BACKGROUND: Professional pressure is one of the most concerned issues in society. Teachers are a group of people with greater professional pressure. The pressure sources include students, schools and society. OBJECTIVE: This exploration aims to explore the professional pressure and mental health of college teachers. METHOD: Based on the expectancy theory, the professional pressure and mental health of different college teachers are investigated. The overall steps are as follows: the determination of topic, questionnaire design, questionnaire distribution and recovery, questionnaire data analysis to obtain results, as well as countermeasure analysis based on the results. RESULTS: The investigation suggests that the sores of college teachers' work pressure load, family life pressure, interpersonal pressure, physical and mental pressure, leadership and organizational factors pressure, career development pressure, scientific research, and professional title pressure are high. From senior to elementary, the pressure of teachers increases first and then decreases. The professional development pressure of liberal arts teachers is significantly higher than that of science teachers and engineering teachers (P0.05). Among science and engineering teachers, the professional development pressure of science teachers is relatively high. Men have better mental health than women (P0.05). Unmarried teachers have the best mental health status, followed by married and finally divorced (P0.05). The mental health of senior and elementary teachers is significantly better than that of sub-senior teachers and intermediate teachers (P0.05).

Impact of a Virtual Introduction to Radiation Oncology Lecture on Stimulating Specialty Interest among Diverse Medical Students at Multiple Institutions,"Mattes, M.D.; Gayed, G.; Thomas, C.R.; Deville, C.","Purpose/Objective(s)Many US medical students lack access to basic education in radiation oncology (RO). This is particularly common at schools with higher enrollment of students underrepresented in medicine (UIM), which may contribute to inadequate diversity in the RO workforce. We hypothesize that a virtual, cross-institutional lecture introducing students to a career in RO will be valuable to students less likely to have access to it otherwise, and increase their interest in RO as a career.Materials/MethodsA 1-hour, live, virtual, extracurricular lecture was offered to all (A) 15 US medical schools with at least 15% enrollment of UIM students per AAMC data, (B) 23 other medical schools lacking an affiliated RO residency program or department, and (C) a convenience sample of 22 medical student groups comprised of primarily UIM members at any US medical schools with contact information available online. Each lecture was promoted broadly, and the overall number of students invited is unknown. The lectures were given individually to each school by a singular academic radiation oncologist. A post-lecture electronic survey of 6 multiple choice and Likert-type questions was used to capture data from participating students. Descriptive statistics are reported. The Fisher's Exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare subgroups of students based on medical school year, gender, race, ethnicity, and presence of affiliated RO department.Results197 students from 13 institutions attended a lecture, and 114 responded to the survey (response rate 58%). Students' demographics included: 68% 1st years, 59% female, 42% white, 32% Asian, 13% Black, 15% Hispanic, and 61% from a school without a RO department. When coordinated by an UIM student group, 60% of respondents were UIM, as compared to 16% UIM respondents when promoted to all medical students (p p=0.05). Only 19 students (17%) reported previously hearing a RO lecture. 98 students (86%) expressed more interest in pursuing a career in RO after the lecture. There was no significant difference in interest in RO for any demographic subgroups of participants. 18 students (16%) contacted the speaker afterwards for guidance on research or mentorship opportunities locally or nationally.ConclusionVirtual RO exposure was feasible to deliver to students less likely to be exposed, and successfully stimulated interest in the specialty among most students regardless of their gender, race, or ethnicity. Sustainable pathways are needed to link these students to RO departments with mentors and sponsors who can help facilitate a more diverse RO workforce.

An exploratory study of instructors' perceptions on inclusion of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education,"Kumi-Yeboah, Alex; Amponsah, Samuel","The rapid growth of diverse learners in online learning has made it imperative for online instructors to incorporate multicultural resource curricula and instructional activities. This research aimed to explore online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education; examine how instructors integrate culturally responsive pedagogy strategies in the online learning environment; and explore the challenges in facilitating cross-cultural collaborative learning for students from different cultural backgrounds. Data were collected following a qualitative multi-site case study method with five academic disciplines (Education, Social Sciences, Engineering, Physical Sciences and Health Sciences) in 12 colleges and universities in the United States of America. In all, 60 in-depth and semi-structured interviews with instructors (26 females and 34 males) were obtained and analysed following a constant comparative analysis approach. Results reflected that the instructors used cross-cultural interactions to facilitate students' engagement and incorporated culturally responsive teaching. Besides, the findings revealed that most of the instructors integrated diverse and internationalized learning content to support diverse students and addressed the impact of multicultural education in online learning. It was, however, noted, that instructors in the physical science disciplines struggled to incorporate culturally diverse contents in their online classes. The findings of this study foster discourse on how best instructors could be aided to engage diverse students online more meaningfully. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Since studies of this nature are mostly undertaken in teaching and learning environments that are diverse in terms of student populations, both students and instructors are exposed to cultural differences in teaching and learning in multicultural/diverse online learning environments. Studies on multicultural/diverse online learning environments abound and have been undertaken for several years but the emphasis has mainly been to explore issues from the perspectives of students. Most online instructors assume that online learning provides equal opportunities to all students regardless of their cultural backgrounds and cultural differences; hence, instructors have mostly not been able to recognize cultural implications for students' learning to design inclusive instructional strategies to meet the learning needs of diverse students in online education. What this paper adds This study, unlike earlier ones with a similar focus, explored online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP), specifically with regards to the design, preparation and integration of multicultural learning contents and resources in online education. This study employed Scott et al.'s (2015) culturally responsive computing theory as a lens to connect students' prior learning experiences, knowledge, interests, strengths and weaknesses as a way to draw instructors' attention to how best diverse students can be aided to be innovative and succeed in the face of cross-cultural challenges they face studying online. The study also contributes to the instructors' understanding of culturally responsive pedagogical principles in online spaces that recognize global identities and cultural experiences to meet the needs of diverse students in an online learning environment. Implications for practice and/or policy Instructors must develop online courses with the focus to bridge students' geographical and cultural backgrounds so that students will have the opportunity to share and connect with peers in online classrooms for effective collaboration and communication. Institutions that offer online education must make concerted efforts to provide continuous professional development opportunities for instructors of online courses on impacts of culture/diversity in the online classroom, and strategies for creating conducive online learning environments that value cultural differences, and social/educational experiences in ways that support students' learning. Institutions and stakeholders, through policy initiatives, should make frantic efforts to afford instructors with comprehensive knowledge and understanding of CRP in online learning to avoid the assumption that students in online courses share similar learning characteristics and bring to the online learning the same experiences and cultural backgrounds. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.",2023,,British Journal of Educational Technology,54,4,878-897,,10.1111/bjet.13299,,#620,Kumi-Yeboah 2023,"",""
Quantitative datasets reveal marked gender disparities in Earth Sciences faculty rank in Africa,"Mosuro, G.O.; Omosanya, K.O.; Lawal, M.A.; Oussou, A.; Oshomoji, A.O.; Neh fru, I.M.; Ratshiedana, P.E.; Ndukwe, O.S.; Rapholo, M.T.D.; Eruteya, O.E.; Alao-Daniel, A.B.; Mohammedyasin, S.; Ajilore, O.; Abdulmalik, N.F.; Ben fredj, S.; Akinlalu, A.A.; Lawal, H.A.; Aturamu, A.O.; Waswa, A.K.; Oyeyemi, K.D.; Tahri, A.A.H.; Ibrahim, Y.Z.; Mituku, S.; Yaro, U.Y.; Ozigis, M.S.; Ibrahim, S.; Isah, H.","As in most disciplines of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM), gender disparity is prevalent in the ranking of Earth Sciences faculties at senior and advanced levels. (i.e., Associate and Full Professors). In this study, a robust database was mined, created, and analyzed to assess the faculty compositions of 142 Earth Science departments in 39 countries across Africa. The data were collected from verifiable online resources focusing on ranks and gender ratios within each department. The studied earth science departments cut across universities in northern, southern, central, eastern, and western Africa. Our data revealed that female faculty members are predominantly underrepresented in most of the departments documented and are markedly uncommon in senior positions such as Professors, associate Professors, and senior researchers compared to their male counterparts. On the contrary, female faculty members are predominant in the lower cadres, such as lecturers, teaching, and graduate assistants. The observed male to female ratio is 4:1. At the base of this gender gap is the lower enrolment of female students in Earth Science courses from undergraudate to graduate studies. To achieve gender equality in Earth Science faculty composition in Africa, we recommend increasing female students' enrollment, mentoring, awareness, timely promotion of accomplished female researchers, and formulation of enabling government policies. More work-related policies that guarantee work-life balance for female earth science academic professionals should be formulated to attract and retain more women into Earth Sciences careers.

Navigating the academic ladder as an early career researcher in earth and environmental sciences,"Alderson, Danielle; Clarke, Lucy; Schillereff, Daniel; Shuttleworth, Emma","There is growing concern in Higher Education around job security, work–life balance and inequalities, and early career researchers (ECRs) must make difficult trade-offs and life choices. Literature confirms that women navigating academia face additional challenges compared to their male counterparts. Few studies connected contractual circumstances, employment priorities and their impacts on the life choices of individual academics. We report results from a survey exploring the experiences of 37 ECRs who completed PhDs in the United Kingdom (UK) navigating the academic ladder in geomorphology and earth/environmental science, and contextualize these findings by drawing on personal experiences and wider literature. We find evidence of multi-directional pressures that have materially negative effects on individuals' life choices, including concern that academic employment is a barrier to living where and with whom one may want to. The level of precarity amongst survey respondents is stark in terms of number of years they have held fixed-term contracts (maximum 10 years), the number of individual contracts held (maximum 14) and number of different institutions worked at (maximum six). Women respondents were less prepared to be employed on precarious contracts and put more emphasis on job security when applying for academic posts, with men being generally more satisfied by financial aspects of university employment; which will amplify the leaky pipeline and gender gaps at more senior levels. We also find that perceived institutional prestige was a surprisingly low priority for the majority of respondents, and there were notable divergences between career advice given by more senior colleagues and the priorities of ECRs seeking guidance. We put forward a set of key considerations: improving policies on parental leave and flexible working; formalizing and improving mentorship; more considerate recruitment procedures; reducing contract precarity; and, transparency on pay and promotion. We believe these are within the scope of action by departments, laboratories and research groups. © 2022 The Authors.

Latin American women in chemical engineering: Challenges and opportunities on process intensification in academia/research,"Ramirez-Corona, N.; Calleja, A.C.A.; Segovia-Hernandez, J.G.; Aristizabal-Marulanda, V.","In the last years, different entities have developed programs to incentivize and involve women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In Europe, Asia, and Africa, only 30% of all professionals working on engineering research are women. In Latin American and the Caribbean countries, the panorama is more encouraging, nearly 50%. In this sense, this paper aims to analyze and highlight the woman's role in chemical and process engineering, especially in the process intensification area in the Latin American context. Initially, the document presents some historical data about relevant women. Then, statistic information is discussed on female researchers in the world, as well as in Latin American countries. The current work areas are also analyzed where there is a particular emphasis on intensified distillation configurations, biofuels and sustainable processes. Finally, some researchers that participated in the special issue solved a survey about their academic experiences. As noticed from the recovered answers, it is possible to claim that successful scientific women stimulate and inspire other women to exemplify transcendence. All academic family trees start with male mentors, but women have gained a relevant place in STEM fields; therefore, the structure will change and be more equitable in the future.

An Exploration of Sources Fostering First-Year Engineering Students' Academic Well-Being in a PBL Environment,"Chen, J.; Du, X.; Chaaban, Y.; Velmurugan, G.; Lyngdorf, N.E.R.; Norgaard, B.; Routhe, H.W.; Hansen, S.; Guerra, A.; Bertel, L.B.","Contribution: This article contributes to the literature surrounding first-year engineering students' academic well-being by proposing a conceptual framework guiding an understanding of supportive sources that foster students' academic well-being. A survey was designed and tested accordingly, and four factors that contribute to students' academic well-being were identified to inspire the improvement of a future course and curriculum design. Background: Prior research has pointed out that students' academic well-being has a significant impact on their persistence in their current study, learning experience, academic achievement, and competence development. However, limited studies have explored first-year engineering students' academic well-being and supportive factors in the field of engineering higher education. To support engineering students to become agentic professionals, it is meaningful to pay close attention to their academic well-being and help them to become purposeful learners at an early stage of their professional development. Research Question: 1) How can an instrument be developed and validated to characterize the sources of students' academic well-being in a project-based learning approaches (PBL) context? 2) What sources could foster students' academic well-being in a PBL context? Are there significant differences in age, gender, and discipline as a function of sources of academic well-being? Methodology: With the guidance of the conceptual framework with the domains of internal and external sources, a survey was designed based on a literature review and conducted in a PBL environment. The survey's content validity, construct validity, and reliability were tested using expert review, a pilot study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Cronbach's alpha. Findings: Supportive sources fostering students' academic well-being were reported in the factors of personal values, agentic action, interactions within the learning environment, and external support. Comparisons between gender, age, and discipline verified the different impacts of the four factors on fostering academic well-being.",2023,/,IEEE Transactions on Education,,,421-30,,10.1109/TE.2023.3273352,,#630,Chen 2023,"",""
An Intelligent Biology Classroom Model Integrating Vocational Education Resource Banks for Skill Certification in Biotechnology Training,"Li, Qiao","This study explores an innovative teaching model for biology education that integrates vocational training and skill certification, aligning with the needs of the biotechnology industry. The research focuses on the development and implementation of an ""intelligent biology classroom"" combining post-course competition and certificate-based teaching with vocational education resource banks. This approach emphasizes aligning biology curricula in higher vocational colleges with industry standards to enhance professional competency in biotechnology training. To actively promote the integration of vocational resource banks into biology education, this study introduces an intelligent teaching framework that leverages digital tools for resource management, curriculum delivery, and skill assessment. Empirical analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this model in enhancing biology education outcomes. Results indicate that the resource bank-based teaching approach significantly outperformed traditional methods in metrics such as basic biological knowledge (85.1 ± 11.9), species analysis (23.1 ± 5.4), and experimental design (7.9 ± 1.6). Furthermore, attributes such as ecological civilization literacy, gender, class attributes, and home location demonstrated significant differences, with P-values less than 0, suggesting the comprehensive impact of this teaching model on student learning outcomes. By integrating vocational education resource banks with biology teaching, this model strengthens the connection between classroom learning and industry-relevant skills, promoting ecological literacy, critical thinking, and professional development. This approach not only enhances the quality of biology education but also prepares students for the demands of the biotechnology workforce, contributing to improved talent cultivation and social service capacity in higher vocational education. This research highlights the potential of combining intelligent classroom models and vocational resource banks to transform biology education, ensuring alignment with the evolving needs of the biotechnology sector and fostering innovation in educational practices. © 2024, Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.

Graduate Student Women's Perceptions of Faculty Careers: The Critical Role of Departmental Values and Support in Career Choice,"Howe, Morgan E.; Kim, Melony M.; Pazicni, Samuel","While the number of women in undergraduate and graduate chemistry programs has increased in recent years, women remain under-represented and excluded in the ranks of faculty in chemistry higher education. This marginalization results from not only fewer women being offered faculty positions but also fewer women applying for these positions. To investigate the reasons why faculty positions are causing so many women to turn elsewhere for employment, a survey was designed based on the literature themes surrounding women's career choices, interviews with the current graduate student women in chemistry programs, and our previous work. The survey was grounded in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), and data were analyzed through a QuantCrit lens. Despite the existing literature focusing on the impact of having children on women's career decisions, the desire to have children did not appear among either the top priorities or the most important factors in predicting whether any of the 130 survey respondents were interested in a faculty career. Instead, faculty career interest was related to themes of overwork, high expectations from departments, and expected department emphasis on research despite an individual's interest in teaching and mentoring. Furthermore, women expressed a strong interest in maintaining work-life balance but low expectations for their ability to obtain a position that would allow it. They also reported a desire to work for a department that values mental health and diversity and supports its community members but similarly low expectations for their ability to find a department that shares these values. These themes suggest that chemistry departments must make fundamental changes regarding what is tangibly valued and rewarded within their systems if they wish to reduce the exclusion of women in faculty positions. © 2022 The Authors.

Understanding professional skills in engineering education: A phenomenographic study of faculty conceptions,"Beagon, Una; Bowe, Brian","Background: Globalization and socially complex problems will greatly affect the way engineers work in the future. Therefore, efforts to transform engineering education must focus on professional skills and engagement of faculty as key change agents. Purpose/Hypotheses: For engineering programs to address the needs of society, graduates must have the skills to tackle future challenges. Transformation will only be successful if faculty fully engage in all curriculum design aspects; however, little is known about how faculty view professional skills. This understanding is critical if we wish to support and encourage their participation in the transformation effort. This novel study reveals the qualitatively different ways faculty conceptualize professional skills. Design/Method: Phenomenography was selected as the most appropriate method to showcase the variations in faculty conceptions. The study selected 19 interview participants from 273 responses to an online survey. Results: Faculty revealed their conceptions of professional skills in six ways: communication skills, technical skills, enabling skills, a combination of skills, interpersonal behaviors, and acting professionally. Conclusions: Findings revealed a tension between technical and nontechnical skills. The study highlights that engineering education must focus on behaviors and interactions between people rather than technical skills alone. Further, there was a gendered difference in conceptions between women and men with women more likely to consider professional skills to be inclusive of behavioral aspects. The findings can help create future strategies for engineering education and can be used as a reflective tool for engineering faculty in efforts to transform engineering education. © 2023 The Authors.

"Towards a more inclusive future: a comprehensive assessment of gender diversity in nuclear medicine education, training and workforce","Brink, A.; Israel, O.; Nadel, H.; Arevalo-Pardo, M.; Kalinchuk, O.; Estrada-Lobato, E.; Naydenova, M.; Drace, M.; Paez, D.","The field of nuclear medicine has undergone remarkable advances, particularly with the introduction of new devices, radionuclides for imaging and therapy, new clinical applications, and emergence of medical evidence. As this dynamic field continues its rapid expansion, there is an urgent need to increase the number of well-trained professionals globally. Consequently, advocating for nuclear medicine as a thriving field of study and work for women becomes paramount in ensuring the establishment of a robust workforce capable of meeting the growing demands. True gender equality will only be achieved when there is equal representation across the spectrum of the nuclear medicine professions, including nuclear medicine technologists, radiopharmacists, radiochemist, medical physicists, nuclear medicine physicians, administrators, academics, and leaders. Currently, the workforce exhibits an imbalance, with females predominating among nuclear medicine technologists, while the number of female physicians, and those in leadership positions remains comparatively lower. There are various factors which contribute to the existing inequities. Societal expectations often impose traditional gender roles that somehow discourage women from pursuing a career in the science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including nuclear medicine. Additionally, prevailing unequal work conditions and gender biases within the workplace can create barriers that hinder women's professional growth and development. Ways of addressing inequalities includes ensuring female participation at all levels of education and training and promoting the field at undergraduate level in medical school. Mentorship programs have demonstrated great success in guiding and supporting women at various stages of their careers. Therefore, there is a need for their expansion and enhancement. Furthermore, female role models play a pivotal role in shattering gender stereotypes and inspiring other women to pursue careers in nuclear medicine and its related fields. By addressing the existing imbalances and fostering an environment that actively encourages and supports women, we can harness the full potential of all professionals, thus ensuring the ongoing progress and advancement of nuclear medicine.

Mentoring across differences in science education: Applying a brokering framework,"Haverly, C.; Brown, B.A.","Mentoring relationships in academia have traditionally been described as a dyad between a mentor and a mentee. The mentor provides the mentee with both technical and psychosocial support to move toward obtaining their Ph.D. or gaining tenure and promotion. While there is an embedded assumption that mentoring is best suited when people of common background support each other, scholars must consider the impact of mentoring across differences. Given the lack of diversity among senior faculty members in science education, and given the increasing diversity represented among graduate students and early career scholars in science education, inevitably mentoring relationships will be formed across differences in identities (race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability). In our essay, we focus on two focal points: we explore those aspects of mentoring relationships that research suggests are critical to the success of relationships built across differences, foregrounding lessons science education researchers can take from this literature and arguing that it is too much to expect one individual mentor to provide to any given mentee. Next, we propose a brokering framework, leveraging technological advances, to work toward more transformative mentoring outcomes at scale, particularly when mentoring across differences. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,/,Science Education,,,1135-48,,10.1002/sce.21720,,#642,Haverly 2022,"",""

Counterspaces for women of color in STEM higher education: Marginal and central spaces for persistence and success,"Ong, Maria; Smith, Janet M.; Ko, Lily T.","Counterspaces in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are often considered ""safe spaces"" at the margins for groups outside the mainstream of STEM education. The prevailing culture and structural manifestations in STEM have traditionally privileged norms of success that favor competitive, individualistic, and solitary practices—norms associated with White male scientists. This privilege extends to structures that govern learning and mark progress in STEM education that have marginalized groups that do not reflect the gender, race, or ethnicity conventionally associated with STEM mainstream success, thus necessitating spaces in which the effects of marginalization may be countered. Women of color is one such marginalized group. This article explores the struggles of women of color that threaten their persistence in STEM education and how those struggles lead them to search out or create counterspaces. It also examines the ways that counterspaces operate for women of color in STEM higher education, particularly how they function as havens from isolation and microaggressions. Using a framework of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and intersectionality theory and drawing on interview data from 39 women of color about their STEM higher education experiences, we describe five ways in which counterspaces operate: in peer-to-peer relationships; mentoring relationships; national STEM diversity conferences; STEM and non-STEM campus student groups; and STEM departments. Whereas most research has discussed counterspaces as racially or ethnically homogeneous social groups of peers at the margins, our research found that counterspaces vary in terms of the race/ethnicity, gender, and power levels of participants. We found that counterspaces can be physical settings, as well as conceptual and ideological. Additionally, we identified counterspaces both at the margins and at the center of STEM departments. Thus, our research expands the existing understanding of the types and functions of counterspaces and broadens the definition of what locations can be and should be considered counterspaces. © 2017 The Authors.
