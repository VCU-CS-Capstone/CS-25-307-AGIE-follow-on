Towards comparable ratings: Exploring bias in German physician reviews,"Kersting, J.; Maoro, F.; Geierhos, M.","In this study, we evaluate the impact of gender-biased data from German-language physician reviews on the fairness of fine-tuned language models. For two different downstream tasks, we use data reported to be gender biased and aggregate it with annotations. First, we propose a new approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis that allows identifying, extracting, and classifying implicit and explicit aspect phrases and their polarity within a single model. The second task we present is grade prediction, where we predict the overall grade of a review on the basis of the review text. For both tasks, we train numerous transformer models and evaluate their performance. The aggregation of sensitive attributes, such as a physician's gender and migration background, with individual text reviews allows us to measure the performance of the models with respect to these sensitive groups. These group-wise performance measures act as extrinsic bias measures for our downstream tasks. In addition, we translate several gender-specific templates of the intrinsic bias metrics into the German language and evaluate our fine-tuned models. Based on this set of tasks, fine-tuned models, and intrinsic and extrinsic bias measures, we perform correlation analyses between intrinsic and extrinsic bias measures. In terms of sensitive groups and effect sizes, our bias measure results show different directions. Furthermore, correlations between measures of intrinsic and extrinsic bias can be observed in different directions. This leads us to conclude that gender-biased data does not inherently lead to biased models. Other variables, such as template dependency for intrinsic measures and label distribution in the data, must be taken into account as they strongly influence the metric results. Therefore, we suggest that metrics and templates should be chosen according to the given task and the biases to be assessed.

Beyond traditional interviews: Psychometric analysis of asynchronous video interviews for personality and interview performance evaluation using machine learning,"Koutsoumpis, Antonis; Ghassemi, Sina; Oostrom, Janneke K.; Holtrop, Djurre; van Breda, Ward; Zhang, Tianyi; de Vries, Reinout E.","With the advent of new technology, traditional job interviews have been supplemented by asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). However, research on psychometric properties of AVIs is limited. In this study, 710 participants completed a mock AVI responding to eight personality questions (Extraversion, Conscientiousness). We collected self- and observer reports of personality, interview performance ratings, attractiveness, and AVI meta-information (e.g., professional attire, audio quality). Then, we automatically extracted the words, facial expressions, and voice characteristics from the videos and trained machine learning models to predict the personality traits and interview performance. Our algorithm explained substantially more variance in observer reports of Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.32) and interview performance (R2 = 0.44), than self-reported Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.12). Consistent with Trait Activation Theory, the explained variance in personality traits increased when participants responded to trait-relevant, compared to trait-irrelevant, questions. The test-retest reliability of our algorithm was somewhat stable over a time period of seven months, but lower than desired reliability standards in personnel selection. We examined potential sources of bias, including age, gender, and attractiveness, and found some instances of algorithmic bias (e.g., gender differences were often amplified in favor of women). © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Computers in Human Behavior,154,,,,10.1016/j.chb.2023.108128,,#671,Koutsoumpis 2024,"",""
Assessing fairness in machine learning models: A study of racial bias using matched counterparts in mortality prediction for patients with chronic diseases,"Wang, Y.; Wang, L.; Zhou, Z.; Laurentiev, J.; Lakin, J.R.; Zhou, L.; Hong, P.","ObjectiveExisting approaches to fairness evaluation often overlook systematic differences in the social determinants of health, like demographics and socioeconomics, among comparison groups, potentially leading to inaccurate or even contradictory conclusions. This study aims to evaluate racial disparities in predicting mortality among patients with chronic diseases using a fairness detection method that considers systematic differences.MethodsWe created five datasets from Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR), each focusing on a different chronic condition: congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic liver disease (CLD), and dementia. For each dataset, we developed separate machine learning models to predict 1-year mortality and examined racial disparities by comparing prediction performances between Black and White individuals. We compared racial fairness evaluation between the overall Black and White individuals versus their counterparts who were Black and matched White individuals identified by propensity score matching, where the systematic differences were mitigated.ResultsWe identified significant differences between Black and White individuals in age, gender, marital status, education level, smoking status, health insurance type, body mass index, and Charlson comorbidity index (p-value p = 0.043), in the CKD cohort for insurance type (p = 0.005) and education level (p = 0.016), and in the dementia cohort for body mass index (p = 0.041); with no significant differences for other covariates. When examining mortality prediction models across the five study cohorts, we conducted a comparison of fairness evaluations before and after mitigating systematic differences. We revealed significant differences in the CHF cohort with p-values of 0.021 and 0.001 in terms of F1 measure and Sensitivity for the AdaBoost model, and p-values of 0.014 and 0.003 in terms of F1 measure and Sensitivity for the MLP model, respectively.Discussion and conclusionThis study contributes to research on fairness assessment by focusing on the examination of systematic disparities and underscores the potential for revealing racial bias in machine learning models used in clinical settings.

Exploring the Impact of Digital Competence and Technology Acceptance on Academic Performance in Physical Education and Sports Science Students,"Rodafinos, A.; Barkoukis, V.; Tzafilkou, K.; Ourda, D.; Economides, A.; Perifanou, M.","Aim/Purpose This study aims to examine the influence of digital competences, technology acceptance, and individual factors (gender and educational level) on academic achievement in Physical Education and Sports Science (PESS). Background Prior research has established a positive correlation between digital competences and performance, but the mediating role of technology acceptance remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the literature about this relationship among students pursuing degrees in PESS. Methodology A survey was administered to 344 students pursuing degrees in PESS. The Students' Digital Competence Scale (SDiCoS) measured digital competences, while the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assessed technology acceptance. Academic performance was evaluated based on students' GPAs. Contribution This paper investigated the role of digital competence within the TAM framework and its influence on academic performance. We propose that digital competence variables positively impact students' intention to use digital tools for learning. This aligns with TAM principles, where intention and attitude toward technology predict its actual use. Our findings further strengthen the understanding of TAM by confirming strong connections between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward technology. Additionally, the study suggests that digital competence and frequent device usage patterns might be more prevalent in postgraduate education. Findings The investigation supports the link between digital competences and technology acceptance in PESS students. Specifically, TAM variables, particularly attitudes and intentions regarding technology use, significantly predicted these students' academic performance. Interestingly, no direct association was found between SDiCoS digital competences and academic performance. Digital competence variables were positively associated with students' intention to use digital tools for learning. Gender differences emerged, with females reporting higher academic performance and proficiency in Communicate, Collaborate, and Share (CCS) competences. Furthermore, postgraduate students reported digital competences, higher academic performance, stronger intentions to use technology, and more frequent utilization of laptops/tablets. Recommendations for Practitioners Educators, administrators, and policymakers should consider targeted interventions and curriculum development to enhance academic performance in the fields of physical education and sports science. Specifically, strategies should focus on fostering digital competences in areas relevant to the field while addressing gender-specific needs. Recommendations for Researchers Future research should further explore the nuanced relationship between digital competences, technology acceptance, and academic performance, with a focus on refining the predictive efficacy of TAM variables and examining the role of individual factors, such as motivation and self-efficacy. Impact on Society The findings have implications for improving academic outcomes in PESS, ultimately contributing to the development of a highly skilled and technology-literate workforce in this field. Future Research Future research should examine the specific mechanisms through which digital competences and technology acceptance influence academic performance to develop effective interventions and strategies.",2024,/,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,23,,1-25,,10.28945/5309,,#674,Rodafinos 2024,"",""
Ten questions in sports engineering: technology in elite women’s football,"Okholm Kryger, Katrine; Thomson, Athol; Tang, Alicia; Brown, Nicola; Bruinvels, Georgie; Rosenbloom, Craig; Carmody, Sean; Williamson, Leah; Datson, Naomi; Jobson, Elena; Mehta, Ritan","The use of technology in football is increasing, although, products predominantly focus on men’s football in performance, safety, comfort, and fit considerations. A recent scoping review identified just 32 published scientific articles on technology in women’s football, despite demands of those playing/working in the women’s game increasing. We wish to highlight the progressions made so far and barriers remaining in the elite women’s football technology to shed a light on this topic and prod researchers and manufacturers to help support the evolution of women’s-football-focussed technological considerations. The ten questions presented in this paper address the generic question on whether women’s specific tailoring is needed (Question 1) as well as addressing specific questions on football technology and engineering, such as the progressions made and ongoing issues in the following areas: football kits, religious considerations (hijab designs), sports bras, football boots, balls, football pitches, performance tracking devices, menstrual cycle tracking devices (Question 2–10).

Performance analysis of machine learning algorithms and screening formulae for β-thalassemia trait screening of Indian antenatal women,"Das, R.; Saleh, S.; Nielsen, I.; Kaviraj, A.; Sharma, P.; Dey, K.; Saha, S.","Background Currently, more than forty discrimination formulae based on red blood cell (RBC) parameters and some supervised machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have been recommended for β-thalassemia trait (BTT) screening. The present study was aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of 26 such formulae and 13 MLAs on antenatal woman data with a recently developed formula SCSBTT, which is available for evaluation in over seventy countries as an Android app, called SUSOKA[16]. Methods A diagnostic database of 2942 antenatal females were collected from PGIMER, Chandigarh, India and was used for this analysis. The data set consists of hypochromic microcytic anemia, BTT, Hemoglobin E trait, double heterozygote for Hemoglobin S and BTT, heterozygote for Hemoglobin D Punjab and normal subjects. Performance of the formulae and the MLAs were assessed by Sensitivity, Specificity, Youden's Index, and AUC-ROC measures. A final recommendation was made from the ranking obtained through two Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques, namely, Simultaneous Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives (SECA) and TOPSIS.ResultsIt was observed that Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) showed maximum Youden's index and AUC-ROC measures compared to all discriminating formulae. Sensitivity remains maximum for SCSBTT. K-means clustering and the ranking from MCDM methods show that SCSBTT, Shine & Lal and Ravanbakhsh-F4 formula ensures higher performance among all formulae. The discriminant power of some MLAs and formulae was found considerably lower than that reported in original studies. Conclusion Comparative information on MLAs can aid researchers in developing new discriminating formulae that simultaneously ensure higher sensitivity and specificity. More multi-centric verification of the formulae on heterogeneous data is indispensable. SCSBTT and Shine & Lal formula, and ELM and GBC are recommended for screening BTT based on MCDM. SCSBTT can be used with certainty as a tangible cost-saving screening tool for mass screening for antenatal women in India and other countries.

Transfer learning for the generalization of artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection: a case-control study,"Africano, Gerson; Arponen, Otso; Rinta-Kiikka, Irina; Pertuz, Said","Background: Some researchers have questioned whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems maintain their performance when used for women from populations not considered during the development of the system. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of transfer learning as a way of improving the generalization of AI systems in the detection of breast cancer. Material and Methods: This retrospective case-control Finnish study involved 191 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 191 matched healthy controls. We selected a state-of-the-art AI system for breast cancer detection trained using a large US dataset. The selected baseline system was evaluated in two experimental settings. First, we examined our private Finnish sample as an independent test set that had not been considered in the development of the system (unseen population). Second, the baseline system was retrained to attempt to improve its performance in the unseen population by means of transfer learning. To analyze performance, we used areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong's test. Results: Two versions of the baseline system were considered: ImageOnly and Heatmaps. The ImageOnly and Heatmaps versions yielded mean AUC values of 0.82±0.008 and 0.88±0.003 in the US dataset and 0.56 (95% CI=0.50–0.62) and 0.72 (95% CI=0.67–0.77) when evaluated in the unseen population, respectively. The retrained systems achieved AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI=0.55–0.66) and 0.69 (95% CI=0.64–0.75), respectively. There was no statistical difference between the baseline system and the retrained system. Conclusion: Transfer learning with a small study sample did not yield a significant improvement in the generalization of the system. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2023.",2024,,Acta Radiologica,65,4,334-340,,10.1177/02841851231218960,,#678,Africano 2024,"",""
Understanding latent affective bias in large pre-trained neural language models,"Kadan, A.; P., D.; Bhadra, S.; P. Gangan, M.; V.l., L.","Groundbreaking inventions and highly significant performance improvements in deep learning based Natural Language Processing are witnessed through the development of transformer based large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The wide availability of unlabeled data within human generated data deluge along with self-supervised learning strategy helps to accelerate the success of large PLMs in language generation, language understanding, etc. But at the same time, latent historical bias/unfairness in human minds towards a particular gender, race, etc., encoded unintentionally/intentionally into the corpora harms and questions the utility and efficacy of large PLMs in many real-world applications, particularly for the protected groups. In this paper, we present an extensive investigation towards understanding the existence of ""Affective Bias"" in large PLMs to unveil any biased association of emotions such as anger, fear, joy, etc., towards a particular gender, race or religion with respect to the downstream task of textual emotion detection. We conduct our exploration of affective bias from the very initial stage of corpus level affective bias analysis by searching for imbalanced distribution of affective words within a domain, in large scale corpora that are used to pre-train and fine-tune PLMs. Later, to quantify affective bias in model predictions, we perform an extensive set of class-based and intensity-based evaluations using various bias evaluation corpora. Our results show the existence of statistically significant affective bias in the PLM based emotion detection systems, indicating biased association of certain emotions towards a particular gender, race, and religion.

Evaluation of mental workload in haptic-enabled virtual assembly training operations,"Macias-Velasquez, S.; Medellin-Castillo, H.I.; Garcia-Barrientos, A.","The use of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the industry has considerably increased in the last years aiming to digitalize, simulate, and optimize processes. However, although the industrial integration of VR has several technical benefits, it may deviate from real-world demands, potentially outperforming human capabilities. In industrial VR research, there is still a lack of awareness of human aspects, and technical aspects are prioritized over user needs. Consequently, large research gaps about the effect of VR systems on the human factor need to be filled in order to know and enhance the user's well-being and experience. Hence, this research aims to investigate the effect of operating a haptic-enabled VR system for industrial assembly training on the mental workload experienced by new users. A random sample of ninety participants was selected to carry out virtual assembly training. Three sets of training durations were selected and evaluated separately: 1, 2, and 3 h. The mental workload was assessed in each of these training durations. The results have demonstrated that the training duration has a small effect on the workload experienced by new users during their first virtual assembly training. In addition, although the workload levels are not very high, females and males experience different workload levels. The research findings fill some of the existing research gaps and can be useful in promoting the long-term mental well-being of workers when implementing VR technologies in the industry.",2024,/,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,132,11-12,5395-5406,,10.1007/s00170-024-13691-9,,#680,Macias-Velasquez 2024,"",""

This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18-72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36% female, 29% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3%-88.8%) and NPV was 98.3% (90.6%-100%). For the 31.8% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4% (91.6%-100%) and specificity was 78.9% (67.6%-87.7%). The Device's indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6% (63/122) (95% CI 42.4%, 60.8%), and specificity would fall to 18.5% (56/303) (95% CI 14.3%, 23.3%).

However, the sensorimotor performance and potential sex differences are still largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in torque steadiness and accuracy during isometric shoulder scaption. We also examined the amplitude and variability of the activation of the trapezius, serratus anterior (SA), and anterior deltoid muscles during torque output evaluation. Thirty-four asymptomatic adults (17 females) participated. Torque steadiness and accuracy were evaluated during submaximal contractions at 20 % and 35 % of peak torque (PT). There was no sex difference in torque coefficient of variation, but females had significantly lower torque standard deviation (SD) values than males at the two intensities evaluated (p < 0.001) and lower torque median frequency values compared to males, regardless of intensity (p < 0.01). Females had significantly lower absolute error values than males for torque output at 35 %PT (p < 0.01) and lower constant error values compared to males, regardless of intensity (p = 0.01). Females had significantly higher muscle amplitude values than males, except for SA (p = 0.10) and in general, females showed higher muscle activation SD values compared to males (p < 0.05). Females may require more complex muscle activation patterns to achieve a more stable and accurate torque output. Therefore, these sex differences may reflect control mechanisms that may also be at play when explaining the greater risk of neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders in females than males.

A novel machine learning approach for evaluation of public policies: an application in relation to the performance of university researchers,"Ballestar, M.T.; Doncel, L.M.; Sainz, J.; Ortigosa-Blanch, A.","Research has become the main reference point for academic life in modern universities. Research incentives have been a controversial issue, because of the difficulty of identifying who are the main beneficiaries and what are the long-term effects. Still, new policies including financial incentives have been adopted to increase the research output at all possible levels. Little literature has been devoted to the response to those incentives. To bridge this gap, we carry out our analysis with data of a six years program developed in Madrid (Spain). Instead of using a traditional econometric approach, we design a machine learning multilevel model to discover on whom, when, and for how long those policies have an effect. The empirical model consists of an automated nested longitudinal clustering (ANLC) performed in two stages. Firstly, it performs a stratification of academics, and secondly, it performs a longitudinal segmentation for each group. The second part considers the researchers’ sociodemographic, academic information and the evolution of their performance over time in the form of the annual percentage variation of their marks over the period. The new methodology, whose robustness is tested with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm, shows that tenure track researchers present a better response to incentives than tenured researches, and also that gender plays an important role in academia. These discoveries are relevant to administrations and universities for understanding the productivity of academics working under long-term incentive-based programs, the drawbacks and the inequalities for maximizing the generation of knowledge.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating AI algorithms as ""medical devices"" to ensure patient safety. However, recent work has shown that the FDA approval process may be deficient. In this study, we evaluate the evidence supporting FDA-approved neuroalgorithms, the subset of machine learning algorithms with applications in the central nervous system (CNS), through a systematic review of the primary literature. Articles covering the 53 FDA-approved algorithms with applications in the CNS published in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Scopus between database inception and January 25, 2022 were queried. Initial searches identified 1505 studies, of which 92 articles met the criteria for extraction and inclusion. Studies were identified for 26 of the 53 neuroalgorithms, of which 10 algorithms had only a single peer-reviewed publication. Performance metrics were available for 15 algorithms, external validation studies were available for 24 algorithms, and studies exploring the use of algorithms in clinical practice were available for 7 algorithms. Papers studying the clinical utility of these algorithms focused on three domains: workflow efficiency, cost savings, and clinical outcomes. Our analysis suggests that there is a meaningful gap between the FDA approval of machine learning algorithms and their clinical utilization. There appears to be room for process improvement by implementation of the following recommendations: the provision of compelling evidence that algorithms perform as intended, mandating minimum sample sizes, reporting of a predefined set of performance metrics for all algorithms and clinical application of algorithms prior to widespread use.

Evaluating Machine Learning Methods of Analyzing Multiclass Metabolomics,"Gong, Yaguo; Ding, Wei; Wang, Panpan; Wu, Qibiao; Yao, Xiaojun; Yang, Qingxia","Multiclass metabolomic studies have become popular for revealing the differences in multiple stages of complex diseases, various lifestyles, or the effects of specific treatments. In multiclass metabolomics, there are multiple data manipulation steps for analyzing raw data, which consist of data filtering, the imputation of missing values, data normalization, marker identification, sample separation, classification, and so on. In each step, several to dozens of machine learning methods can be chosen for the given data set, with potentially hundreds or thousands of method combinations in the whole data processing chain. Therefore, a clear understanding of these machine learning methods is helpful for selecting an appropriate method combination for obtaining stable and reliable analytical results of specific data. However, there has rarely been an overall introduction or evaluation of these methods based on multiclass metabolomic data. Herein, detailed descriptions of these machine learning methods in multiple data manipulation steps are reviewed. Moreover, an assessment of these methods was performed using a benchmark data set for multiclass metabolomics. First, 12 imputation methods for imputing missing values were evaluated based on the PSS (Procrustes statistical shape analysis) and NRMSE (normalized root-mean-square error) values. Second, 17 normalization methods for processing multiclass metabolomic data were evaluated by applying the PMAD (pooled median absolute deviation) value. Third, different methods of identifying markers of multiclass metabolomics were evaluated based on the CWrel (relative weighted consistency) value. Fourth, nine classification methods for constructing multiclass models were assessed using the AUC (area under the curve) value. Performance evaluations of machine learning methods are highly recommended to select the most appropriate method combination before performing the final analysis of the given data. Overall, detailed descriptions and evaluation of various machine learning methods are expected to improve analyses of multiclass metabolomic data. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",2023,,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,63,24,7628-7641,,10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01525,,#689,Gong 2023,"",""

Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)",2021,,Journal of Cleaner Production,285,,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125242,,#690,Frank 2021,"",""
Synergy of carbohydrate and caffeine ingestion on physical performance and metabolic responses to exercise: A systematic review with meta-analysis,"Lopez-Seoane, Jaime; Buitrago-Morales, Marta; Jimenez, Sergio L.; Del Coso, Juan; Pareja-Galeano, Helios","Carbohydrates (CHO) and caffeine (CAF) are two ergogenic aids commonly used among athletes to enhance performance. However, there is some controversy as to whether the concurrent intake of both supplements might result in an additive and synergistic improvement in exercise performance. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of adding CAF to a protocol of CHO ingestion, compared with the intake of each ergogenic aid alone and with placebo, on exercise performance and metabolic responses in healthy young physically active adults. This study was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The PubMed, Web of Science, Medline Complete, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and CENTRAL databases were searched including randomized controlled trials (RCT) that were at least single blind. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool 2. Meta-analysis were performed on performance variables and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the random-effects model. Thirteen RCT with 128 participants (117 men and 11 women) were included in this study. The ingestion of CAF and CHO reduced sprint time during repeated sprint protocols in comparison with CHO isolated ingestion (SMD: −0.45; 95% CI: −0.85, −0.05) while there was a tendency for a reduction in the time employed during time trials (SMD: −0.36; 95% CI: −0.77, 0.05). The RPE tended to be lower with CAF and CHO compared with CHO isolated ingestion during steady-state exercise (SMD: −0.43; 95% CI: −0.91, 0.05) with no differences between conditions in performance trials (SMD: −0.05, 95% CI: −0.39, 0.29). Although most of the studies showed higher values of blood glucose when CHO was co-ingested with CAF compared with PLA, only two studies observed higher values with CHO and CAF co-ingestion with respect to the isolated intake of CHO. One study observed greater fat oxidation and lower glycogen use when CAF was added to CHO. In terms of cortisol levels, one study showed an increase in cortisol levels when CAF was co-ingested with CHO compared with PLA. In summary, concurrent CHO and CAF intake may produce an additive ergogenic effect respect of the isolated ingestion of CHO. This additive effect was present when CHO was provided by a 6–9% of CHO solution (maltodextrin/dextrin + fructose) and CAF is administered in a dose of 4–6.5 mg/kg. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,64,10,2941-2959,,10.1080/10408398.2022.2128298,,#691,Lopez-Seoane 2024,"",""
Student Performance Patterns in Engineering at the University of Johannesburg: An Exploratory Data Analysis,"Maphosa, Mfowabo; Doorsamy, Wesley; Paul, Babu S.","Globally, the increased demand for engineers is not matched by an increase in graduates. This is further exacerbated by the fact that student dropout rates in engineering are higher than in other disciplines. Understanding engineering students' performance patterns and potential influences can lead to developing interventions to improve engineering students' success. Recent advances in data science and educational data mining have made it possible to extract valuable information from historical data, which can supplement interventions. This study sought to extract insights and information from real-world data, analyse correlations in the dataset's variables and better understand the influences of student performance. Exploratory data analysis was applied to the dataset to visualise the dataset and infer the correlations between variables provided in the dataset on student performance patterns. We used Python for data analysis and visualising the correlation between variables. The results show gender disparity in engineering enrollments, with only a quarter of female students enrolled. The study also indicates that the completion rates could be much higher. Another finding is that most students who drop out do so because of choosing the wrong qualifications. Furthermore, when comparing the percentages, female students performed slightly better than their male counterparts. The correlation analysis shows no relationships between gender, race, admission point score, mathematics marks and science marks with student performance in engineering. Understanding student performance patterns can reduce dropout rates by correctly advising students to enrol on the most suitable programmes, and aid support interventions are needed to improve student success in engineering. © 2013 IEEE.",2023,,IEEE Access,11,,48977-48987,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277225,,#692,Maphosa 2023,"",""
Motion Technologies in Support of Fence Athletes: A Systematic Review,"Aresta, S.; Musci, M.; Bottiglione, F.; Moretti, L.; Moretti, B.; Bortone, I.","Sports biomechanics enables thorough examination of athletic movements to enhance athletic performance and/or reduce injury risk. Few studies have looked at the possibilities of cutting-edge technology in fencing, even though it presents an intriguing scenario for sports biomechanics due to the significant demands it places on the body in terms of neuromuscular coordination, strength, power, and musculoskeletal system impact. The aim of the study is to identify and summarise current evidence on the application of motion technologies in support of fence athletes and to provide a framework for the assessment and training of fencers, including performance measures and protocols. Peer-reviewed research was identified from electronic databases using a structured keyword search. Details regarding experimental design, study group characteristics, and measured outcomes were extracted from retrieved studies, summarised, and information regrouped under themes for analysis. The methodological quality of the evidence was evaluated. Thirty-five studies were included in the present review, which showed kinetic, kinematic, muscle recruitment and coordination differences among athletes as gender and athletic training differed. Findings revealed that most of the included studies investigated the lunge technique in professional athletes using Optoelectronic Systems and force platforms as preferred motion technologies. Only nine studies reported the assessment of muscle activation during task execution (25.7%). Less than 20% of the study recurred to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches in the analysis. The potential contribution of the user's kinematic/kinetic data and physiological measures is still underestimated.

Semisupervised transfer learning for evaluation of model classification performance,"Wang, Linshanshan; Wang, Xuan; Liao, Katherine P.; Cai, Tianxi","In many modern machine learning applications, changes in covariate distributions and difficulty in acquiring outcome information have posed challenges to robust model training and evaluation. Numerous transfer learning methods have been developed to robustly adapt the model itself to some unlabeled target populations using existing labeled data in a source population. However, there is a paucity of literature on transferring performance metrics, especially receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters, of a trained model. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of a trained binary classifier on unlabeled target population based on ROC analysis. We proposed Semisupervised Transfer lEarning of Accuracy Measures (STEAM), an efficient three-step estimation procedure that employs (1) double-index modeling to construct calibrated density ratio weights and (2) robust imputation to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data to improve estimation efficiency. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under the correct specification of either the density ratio model or the outcome model. We also correct for potential overfitting bias in the estimators in finite samples with cross-validation. We compare our proposed estimators to existing methods and show reductions in bias and gains in efficiency through simulations. We illustrate the practical utility of the proposed method on evaluating prediction performance of a phenotyping model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a temporally evolving EHR cohort. © The Author(s) 2024.

Debiasing Education Algorithms,"Idowu, Jamiu Adekunle","This systematic literature review investigates the fairness of machine learning algorithms in educational settings, focusing on recent studies and their proposed solutions to address biases. Applications analyzed include student dropout prediction, performance prediction, forum post classification, and recommender systems.

Commonly used metrics for fairness assessment include ABROCA, group difference in performance, and disparity metrics. The review underscores the need for context-specific approaches to ensure equitable treatment and reveals that most studies found no strict tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. We recommend evaluating fairness of data and features before algorithmic fairness to prevent algorithms from receiving discriminatory inputs, expanding the scope of education fairness studies beyond gender and race to include other demographic attributes, and assessing the impact of fair algorithms on end users, as human perceptions may not align with algorithmic fairness measures. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,34,4,1510-1540,,10.1007/s40593-023-00389-4,,#695,Idowu 2024,"",""

The AR group reported greater workload during training but demonstrated better performance during evaluation. We used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare brain activation and functional connectivity across groups during evaluation. We found that participants in the AR group displayed smaller brain networks during the evaluation, suggesting more efficient utilization of neural resources.

Four years instantaneously measured data were changed to monthly data at five locations belonging to five different climatic regions in Pakistan which were used as training dataset and nine correlations for each location (a total of 45) were formulated and their performance was assessed. Moreover, nine general empirical models were developed using the entire dataset (11 years) for five locations which were termed as generalized correlations (GCs). These GCs were validated by applying them to five other locations and comparing the generated results with measured results for those locations (validation dataset). The best model among GCs was found as GC8 which was then applied to compute DF for five more locations for which short-term (8 months) measured data were also available and thus a reasonable comparison could be made. Results showed that (1) new models were better than literature models, (2) GCs correlations were found in good agreement, and (3) second-degree multi-variate polynomial models are the best performance models with minimum errors, e.g., mean absolute biased error (MABE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), sum of square of relative error (SSRE), and relative standard error (RSE) for GC8 were estimated as 0.018, 6.397, 0.021, 0.006, and 0.022, respectively (all values for Karachi).

The effect of moderate broadband noise on cognitive performance: a systematic review,"Zhou, H.; Molesworth, B.R.C.; Burgess, M.; Hatfield, J.","Individuals in occupational settings are often exposed to moderate levels (e.g., < 85 dBA) of background noise (i.e., broadband noise) while performing cognitive-based tasks.

The present review outlines the effect of moderate broadband noise on indices of cognition such as reaction time, attention, short-term and long-term memory, and high(er)-order cognitive tasks such as decision-making, mental arithmetic, grammatic reasoning, or reading comprehension. The present review highlights limitations associated with moderators, and their effect on broadband noise. 43 studies ranging from 1980 to February 2023 were selected and analysed to investigate this issue. Reviewed results offered minimal evidence for a negative effect of moderate broadband noise on cognitive performance. Negative effects that were found, were often evident only under specific circumstances.

Performance evaluation of DFT based speckle reduction framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images at different frequencies and image regions,"Jain, V.; Shitole, S.; Rahman, M.","Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are widely used for remote sensing and geoscience applications. However, the coherent processing of radar signals in PolSAR imaging leads to the presence of speckle noise, which can significantly degrade image quality and limit the accuracy of subsequent analyses. To address this issue, speckle reduction frameworks are often applied to PolSAR images to reduce the noise level and enhance image quality. In this paper, the performance of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based speckle reduction framework is evaluated on different bands (L, C, and P band) against various evaluation metrics like CV, SD, SNR, ENL, SSI and SMPI. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing filtered and unfiltered images across different parameters, such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, equivalent number of looks (ENL), variance, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on all three bands for the diagonal elements (T11, T22, and T33) of T3 matrix. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework's ability to (i) smoothen homogeneous regions, (ii) preserve contours, and (iii) retain polarimetric information. The framework's ability to reduce speckle noise and improve image quality is demonstrated through a significant reduction in standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and improvement in SNR and ENL values. The proposed framework successfully preserved polarimetric information while effectively suppressing speckle noise. These results suggest that the proposed framework could be a valuable tool for improving PolSAR image quality and enhancing subsequent processing of PolSAR data.

Multi-Group Fairness Evaluation via Conditional Value-at-Risk Testing,"Monteiro Paes, L.; Suresh, A.T.; Beutel, A.; Calmon, F.P.; Beirami, A.","Machine learning (ML) models used in prediction and classification tasks may display performance disparities across population groups determined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex, age). We consider the problem of evaluating the performance of a fixed ML model across population groups defined by multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., race and sex and age). Here, the sample complexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g., the largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number of group-denoting sensitive attributes. To address this issue, we propose an approach to test for performance disparities based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a model has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity required for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be at most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a byproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior distribution, we show that Rényi entropy of order 2/3 of the prior distribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test algorithm. Finally, we also show that there exists a non-i.i.d. data collection strategy that results in a sample complexity independent of the number of groups.",2024,/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory,5,,659-74,,10.1109/JSAIT.2024.3397741,,#706,MonteiroPaes 2024,"",""

For the domain Memory, subclass Verbal and Visual Memory RF-EMF exposure probably results in little to no difference in speed and does not reduce speed (Hedges's g 0.042, 95 % CI [−0.15; 0.23], I2 = 0 %, 102 participants); it may result in little to no difference in accuracy (Hedges's g −0.087, 95 % CI [−0.38; 0.20], I2 = 85 %, 625 participants). For the domain Verbal Functions and Language Skills, subclass Verbal Expression, a meta-analysis was not possible because one of the two included studies did not provide numerical values. Results of both studies did not indicate statistically significant effects of RF-EMF exposure on both speed and accuracy. For the domain Construction and Motor Performance, subclass Motor Skills RF-EMF exposure may reduce speed, but the evidence is very uncertain (Hedges's g −0.919, 95 % CI [−3.09; 1.26], I2 = 96 %, 42 participants); it probably results in little to no difference in accuracy and does not reduce accuracy (Hedges's g 0.228, 95 % CI [−0.01; 0.46], I2 = 0 %, 109 participants).

For the domain Concept Formation and Reasoning, subclass Mathematical Procedures RF-EMF exposure results in little to no difference in speed (Hedges's g 0.033, 95 % CI [−0.12; 0.18], I2 = 0 %, 168 participants) and may result in little to no difference in accuracy but probably does not reduce accuracy (Hedges's g 0.232, 95 % CI [−0.12; +0.59], I2 = 86 %, 253 participants). For the domain Executive Functions there were no studies. Discussion: Overall, the results from all domains and subclasses across their speed- and accuracy-related outcome measures according to GRADE provide high to low certainty of evidence that short-term RF-EMF exposure does not reduce cognitive performance in human experimental studies. For 16 out of 35 subdomains some uncertainty remains, because of limitations in the study quality, inconsistency in the results or imprecision of the combined effect size estimate.

Internal and External Load Profile during Beach Invasion Sports Match-Play by Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems: A Systematic Review,"Vaccaro-Benet, P.; Gomez-Carmona, C.D.; Marzano-Felisatti, J.M.; Pino-Ortega, J.","Beach variants of popular sports like soccer and handball have grown in participation over the last decade. However, the characterization of the workload demands in beach sports remains limited compared to their indoor equivalents. This systematic review aimed to: (1) characterize internal and external loads during beach invasion sports match-play; (2) identify technologies and metrics used for monitoring; (3) compare the demands of indoor sports; and (4) explore differences by competition level, age, sex, and beach sport. Fifteen studies ultimately met the inclusion criteria. The locomotive volumes averaged 929 ± 269 m (average) and 16.5 ± 3.3 km/h (peak) alongside 368 ± 103 accelerations and 8 ± 4 jumps per session. The impacts approached 700 per session. The heart rates reached 166-192 beats per minute (maximal) eliciting 60-95% intensity. The player load was 12.5 ± 2.9 to 125 ± 30 units. Males showed 10-15% higher external but equivalent internal loads versus females. Earlier studies relied solely on a time-motion analysis, while recent works integrate electronic performance and tracking systems, enabling a more holistic quantification. However, substantial metric intensity zone variability persists. Beach sports entail intermittent high-intensity activity with a lower-intensity recovery. Unstable surface likely explains the heightened internal strain despite moderately lower running volumes than indoor sports. The continued integration of technology together with the standardization of workload intensity zones is needed to inform a beach-specific training prescription.",2024,/,Sensors,24,12,3738 (20 pp.),,10.3390/s24123738,,#709,Vaccaro-Benet 2024,"",""
FACES: A Deep-Learning-Based Parametric Model to Improve Rosacea Diagnoses,"Seungman Park; Chien, A.L.; Beiyu Lin; Keva Li","Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that causes visible blood vessels and redness on the nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead. However, visual assessment, the current standard method used to identify rosacea, is often subjective among clinicians and results in high variation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have allowed for the effective detection of various skin diseases with high accuracy and consistency. In this study, we develop a new methodology, coined ""five accurate CNNs-based evaluation system (FACES)"", to identify and classify rosacea more efficiently. First, 19 CNN-based models that have been widely used for image classification were trained and tested via training and validation data sets. Next, the five best performing models were selected based on accuracy, which served as a weight value for FACES. At the same time, we also applied a majority rule to five selected models to detect rosacea. The results exhibited that the performance of FACES was superior to that of the five individual CNN-based models and the majority rule in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. In particular, the accuracy and sensitivity of FACES were the highest, and the specificity and precision were higher than most of the individual models. To improve the performance of our system, future studies must consider patient details, such as age, gender, and race, and perform comparison tests between our model system and clinicians.",2023,/,Applied Sciences,,,970 (12 pp.),,10.3390/app13020970,,#711,SeungmanPark 2023,"",""
Associations between muscle myotonometry (a)symmetry and functional movement performance in young women and men,"Radziunas, K.; Radziuniene, M.; Vainoras, A.; Poderys, J.","Asymmetry of body parts refers to absence of symmetry and unevenly developed body parts in terms of the axis and plane. It has been long ago noticed that no perfectly correct human body exists, and bodies are to a greater or lesser extent asymmetric. A passive way of life, insufficient movement and inappropriate ergonomics of the workplace have a negative impact on the skeletal muscle system, usually resulting in reduced muscle power, static and dynamic muscle endurance, and altered muscle tone. The aim is to determine whether muscle myotonometry parameters are informative in early risk diagnostics to predict the likelihood of skeletal muscle system trauma. The study involved 382 people aged 18-24. Participants were devided into two groups: according to the accumulated composite score. Testing was made one time. The study consisted of functional movement and myotonometry evaluation. The study analyses and presents comparisons of the results depending on the trauma likelihood and sex. In addition, asymmetry of the left and the right body side is investigated. The analysis of the asymmetries (delta) in the frequency of damped oscillations of trapezius, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius (inner and outer part) on the left and right sides of the body demonstrated greater asymmetries between the left and the right sides of the body in the groups of both men and women with a lower chance of trauma. The assessment of asymmetries in femoris rectus and tibialis anterior between the left and the right sides of the body showed differences in the frequency of damped oscillations in all groups. Muscle myotonometry parameters are informative and may be used in early risk diagnostics to predict skeletal muscle system trauma. The asymmetry in tibialis muscle tone between the left and the right leg causes poorer parameters of functional movement performance in women. No associations were found to exist with the ability to perform functional movements in men. The asymmetry in femoris muscle tone between the left and right leg demonstrates the ability of young subjects to perform functional movements. It is characteristic of men and, to a lower extent, of women.",2018,03/,Journal of Measurements in Engineering,6,1,53-63,,10.21595/jme.2018.19686,,#712,Radziunas 2018,"",""

Performance evaluation of a multi-functional personalized environmental control system (PECS) prototype,"Shinoda, Jun; Bogatu, Dragos-Ioan; Watanabe, Futa; Kaneko, Yosuke; Olesen, Bjarne W.; Kazanci, Ongun B.","A prototype of a multifunctional, stand-alone Personalized Environmental Control System (PECS) was developed and evaluated. The prototype comprised an electric heating panel and an air terminal device (ATD) for supplying air cleaned by a filter and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. A Peltier element was installed in the ATD for cooling the supply air. Experiments were conducted in a climate chamber to evaluate the performance of the prototype. Thermal manikin measurements were conducted to quantify the heating and cooling effects of the PECS. Tracer gas measurements using nitrous oxide with a breathing thermal manikin were conducted to evaluate the air distribution performance of the ATD. A human subject experiment was conducted with 24 university students (12 male and 12 female) at 18–28 °C room temperatures. The whole body heating and cooling effects of the PECS, in manikin-based equivalent temperature differences, were up to 1.3 K and 0.3 K, respectively. The ventilation effectiveness of the ATD was up to 1.4. The prototype was able to increase thermal acceptability at all tested temperatures for female subjects. For the male subjects, the thermal acceptability decreased with PECS at 28 °C, possibly due to their cooling expectations not being met. The Peltier element did not provide a noticeable cooling enhancement despite its high power use. The noise generated by the ATD fan and the smell of the ATD supply air acted as factors limiting the use of PECS. A holistic assessment of the IEQ factors and ergonomic factors is important for future development of PECS. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Building and Environment,252,,,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.111260,,#715,Shinoda 2024,"",""
Evaluation on the performance of quilts based on young people's sleep quality and thermal comfort in winter,"He, Manchen; Lian, Zhiwei; Chen, Pin","This study evaluated the performance of three different quilts (white duck down quilt, white goose down quilt and cotton quilt) based on sleep quality and thermal comfort of young people in non-heating bedroom in winter. Thermal comfort and sleep quality were subjectively evaluated before and after sleep. Electroencephalograms (EEG), skin temperatures and bed climate were measured throughout the all-night sleep. Both subjective and physiological results showed that quilt materials had a significant effect on sleep quality and thermal comfort. The goose down quilt was evaluated the most comfortable in overall sleep comfort and sleep thermal sensation. The duration of slow wave sleep as calculated by EEG signal was longer, the skin temperatures and bed climate were higher when the goose down quilt was used. The results also show that there are gender differences in skin temperatures. Compared with males, the mean skin temperature (MST) of females was higher, while their foot temperature was significantly lower, which suggest that for females more attention should be paid to maintain warmth of extremity during sleep in winter. Our results suggest that sleep quality and thermal comfort is the most desirable when using goose down quilt and undesirable when using cotton quilt.

Excess fluoride in drinking water above the maximum contaminant level (e.g., the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 1.5 mg/L) also affects the skeletal and nervous systems of humans. Fluoride removal from aqueous solutions is difficult using conventional electrochemical, precipitation, and adsorption methods owing to its ionic size and reactivity. Thus, new technologies have been introduced to reduce the fluoride concentration in industrial wastewater effluents and various drinking water sources. Membrane technology is one of the newer technologies found to be very effective in significantly reducing fluoride to desired standards levels; however, it has received less attention than other technologies because it is perceived as a costly process. This study critically reviewed the performance of various membrane process and compared it with effluent and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) standards.

Deep Learning in Virtual Try-On: A Comprehensive Survey,"Islam, T.; Miron, A.; Liu, X.; Li, Y.","Virtual try-on technology has gained significant importance in the retail industry due to its potential to transform the way customers interact with products and make purchase decisions. It allows users to virtually try on clothing and accessories, providing a realistic representation of how the items would look and fit without the need for physical interaction. The ability to virtually try on products addresses common challenges associated with online shopping, such as uncertainty about fit and style, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience and satisfaction. As a result, virtual try-on technology has the potential to reduce returns and optimise conversion rates for businesses, making it a valuable tool in the e-commerce landscape. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning based virtual try-on models, focusing on their functionality, technical details, dataset usage, weaknesses, and impact on customer satisfaction. The models are categorised into three main types: image-based, multi-pose, and video virtual try-on models, with detailed examples and technical summaries provided for each category. Additionally, we identify and discuss similarities and differences in these methods. Furthermore, we examine the datasets currently available for building and evaluating virtual try-on models, including the number of images/videos and their resolutions. We present the commonly used methods for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing synthesised images with previous work and performing quantitative evaluations across various metrics and benchmark datasets. We discuss the weaknesses of current deep learning based virtual try-on models, including challenges in preserving clothing characteristics and textures, the level of accuracy of applying the clothing to the person, and the preservation of facial identities. Additionally, we address dataset bias, particularly the domination of female models, limited diversity in clothing featured, and relatively simple and clean backgrounds in the datasets, which can negatively impact the model's ability to handle challenging situations. Moreover, we explore the impact of virtual try-ons on customer satisfaction, highlighting the benefits that customers can enjoy, which also reduces returns and optimises conversion rates for businesses.",2024,/,IEEE Access,12,,29475-29502,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3368612,,#721,Islam 2024,"",""

Exploring the gender gap in the conceptual survey of electricity and magnetism,"Henderson, R.; Stewart, G.; Stewart, J.; Michaluk, L.; Traxler, A.","The “gender gap” on various physics conceptual evaluations has been extensively studied. Men’s average pretest scores on the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are 13% higher than women’s, and post-test scores are on average 12% higher than women’s. This study analyzed the gender differences within the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) in which the gender gap has been less well studied and is less consistent. In the current study, data collected from 1407 students (77% men, 23% women) in a calculus-based physics course over ten semesters showed that male students outperformed female students on the CSEM pretest (5%) and post-test (6%). Separate analyses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative problems on lab quizzes and course exams and showed that male students outperformed female students by 3% on qualitative quiz and exam problems. Male and female students performed equally on the quantitative course exam problems. The gender gaps within CSEM post-test scores, qualitative lab quiz scores, and qualitative exam scores were insignificant for students with a CSEM pretest score of 25% or less but grew as pretest scores increased. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that a latent variable, called Conceptual Physics Performance/Non-Quantitative (CPP/NonQnt), orthogonal to quantitative test performance was useful in explaining the differences observed in qualitative performance; this variable was most strongly related to CSEM post-test scores. The CPP/NonQnt of male students was 0.44 standard deviations higher than female students. The CSEM pretest measured CPP/NonQnt much less accurately for women (R2=4%) than for men (R2=17%). The failure to detect a gender gap for students scoring 25% or less on the pretest suggests that the CSEM instrument itself is not gender biased. The failure to find a performance difference in quantitative test performance while detecting a gap in qualitative performance suggests the qualitative differences do not result from psychological factors such as science anxiety or stereotype threat.",2017,07/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,13,2,020114 (17 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020114,,#724,Henderson 2017,"",""
Malicious insider threat detection using variation of sampling methods for anomaly detection in cloud environment,"S, Asha; D, Shanmugapriya; G, Padmavathi","Machine learning (ML) techniques have currently been exploited for malicious insider threat (MIT) detection. The data variation between malicious and genuine user influences the ML model to misinterpret a malicious insider. Hence, the class imbalance problem (CIP) remains a challenging one. Regardless of the CIP in MIT detection, past research has a significant shortfall in deploying diverse sampling methods. i.e., undersampling and oversampling approach. This study proposed a novel double-layer architecture for MIT detection. The initial layer involves integration, transformation, and sampling system of data. In the sampling system, an efficient sampling approach is adopted to depreciate CIP among eight sampling techniques, depending on the performance of support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Nearmiss2 (NM-2) excels and is considered an optimal sampling technique. In the second layer, sampled data of NM-2 is employed in an anomalous MIT detection model using various anomaly detection techniques and evaluated with performance metrics. The main focus is to validate the solution for CIP in anomaly detection techniques with previous research.

Prediction of fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination using ensemble learning,"Lu, Yu; Fu, Xianghua; Chen, Fangxiong; Wong, Kelvin K.L.","Obstetric ultrasound examination of physiological parameters has been mainly used to estimate the fetal weight during pregnancy and baby weight before labour to monitor fetal growth and reduce prenatal morbidity and mortality. However, the problem is that ultrasound estimation of fetal weight is subject to population's difference, strict operating requirements for sonographers, and poor access to ultrasound in low-resource areas. Inaccurate estimations may lead to negative perinatal outcomes. This study aims to predict fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination within a certain accuracy. We consider that machine learning can provide an accurate estimation for obstetricians alongside traditional clinical practices, as well as an efficient and effective support tool for pregnant women for self-monitoring. We present a robust methodology using a data set comprising 4212 intrapartum recordings. The cubic spline function is used to fit the curves of several key characteristics that are extracted from ultrasound reports. A number of simple and powerful machine learning algorithms are trained, and their performance is evaluated with real test data. We also propose a novel evaluation performance index called the intersection-over-union (loU) for our study. The results are encouraging using an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms. The experimental results show the loU between predicted range of fetal weight at any gestational age that is given by the ensemble model and ultrasound respectively. The machine learning based approach applied in our study is able to predict, with a high accuracy, fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,102,,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101748,,#731,Lu 2020,"",""
A Performance Evaluation of the BIM-Based Object-Oriented Physical Modeling Technique for Building Thermal Simulations: A Comparative Case Study,WoonSeong Jeong; Kee Han Kim,"The development of separate building performance simulation tools has brought about a significant need for the integration of multi-domain simulations that would enable multiple building performance analyses to be conducted from a single building model. Insufficient data integration between the tools and Building Information Modeling (BIM) currently prevents the efficient production of comprehensive building performance analyses. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain simulation tool, effective and efficient data, and a process integration methodology are all required. Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) has emerged as a form of object-oriented modeling capable of supporting multiple domain simulations. Adoption of OOPM into building performance simulations with BIM is particularly interesting as a means of facilitating model translations between BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modeling). Specifically, complex data translation from the building topology in BIM to the space boundary conditions in BEM is both labor intensive and time consuming. This research uses case studies to investigate the feasibility of automatically translating a building topology from BIM to OOPM-based BEM. We included numerous preconditions in order to incorporate various object semantic differences into each model translation. Our research indicates that this adoption approach allows seamless model translations from BIM to OOPM-based BEM, which supports efficient and effective thermal simulations and facilitates the reuse of BIM data in multi-domain simulations.",2016,07/,Sustainability,8,7,648 (27 pp.),,10.3390/su8070648,,#732,WoonSeongJeong 2016,"",""
Promising energy-storage applications by flotation of graphite ores: A review,Ye Chen; Shilong Li; Shiru Lin; Mingzhe Chen; Cheng Tang; Xinghui Liu,"Graphite-based materials have attracted extensive attention due to their structure and excellent conductivity. Thus, the graphite-based ore industry has developed quickly. However, a complete industrial chain from raw materials, research and development (R & D), various types of applications, and commercial products have not yet been fully formed. To further accelerate the process of industrialization, optimizing the beneficiation process is necessary for improving the valuable minerals because of the difference in physical and chemical properties of the mineral. This review briefly introduces the standard beneficiation methods: gravity, magnetic, electric, and flotation separation. Specifically, we present a comprehensive process of the flotation method, including developing flotation reagents (collecting agent, foaming agent, inhibitor, activation agent, and pH regulators) and the revolutionary process of high-quality graphite flake. Finally, the representative energy storage application, including supercapacitors and batteries utilizing graphite-based materials, was discussed in the aspect of filtering alternating current, flexible, stretchable, transparent, and high-performance energy-storage devices. This review not only summarizes the high-quality graphite obtained from the graphite ore flotation method but also encourages graphite-based materials research and development in academia and industry, which has the potential to directly affect the industrialization process by lowering the manufacturing cost of post-treatment graphite.

"Quantitative approach to collaborative learning: Performance prediction, individual assessment, and group composition","Ling Cen; Ruta, D.; Powell, L.; Hirsch, B.; Ng, J.","The benefits of collaborative learning, although widely reported, lack the quantitative rigor and detailed insight into the dynamics of interactions within the group, while individual contributions and their impacts on group members and their collaborative work remain hidden behind joint group assessment. To bridge this gap we intend to address three important aspects of collaborative learning focused on quantitative evaluation and prediction of group performance. First, we use machine learning techniques to predict group performance based on the data of member interactions and thereby identify whether, and to what extent, the group’s performance is driven by specific patterns of learning and interaction. Specifically, we explore the application of Extreme Learning Machine and Classification and Regression Trees to assess the predictability of group academic performance from live interaction data. Second, we propose a comparative model to unscramble individual student performances within the group. These performances are then used further in a generative mixture model of group grading as an explicit combination of isolated individual student grade expectations and compared against the actual group performances to define what we coined as collaboration synergy - directly measuring the improvements of collaborative learning. Finally the impact of group composition of gender and skills on learning performance and collaboration synergy is evaluated. The analysis indicates a high level of predictability of group performance based solely on the style and mechanics of collaboration and quantitatively supports the claim that heterogeneous groups with the diversity of skills and genders benefit more from collaborative learning than homogeneous groups.",2016,06/,International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning,11,2,187-225,,10.1007/s11412-016-9234-6,,#735,LingCen 2016,"",""

Performance-based testing for ICT skills assessing: a case study of students and teachers’ ICT skills in Finnish schools,"Kaarakainen, M.-T.; Kivinen, O.; Vainio, T.","Skills enabling and ensuring universal access to information have been investigated intensively during the past few years. The research results provide knowledge on the differences and digital divides. When examining ICT skill levels, the accuracy of assessment is one of the key issues to address the results and gain the applicable data for appropriate interventions to enhance digital inclusion. To date, ICT skill assessment is based mainly on self-reports and subjective evaluations. However, as previous studies have shown, people tend to overrate or underrate their own levels of competence. Thus, novel performance-based approach for assessing ICT skills is presented in this paper. The ICT skill test contains 42 tasks grouped into 17 ICT fields. The study was conducted with upper comprehensive and upper secondary level school students (n = 3159) and their teachers (n = 626) during years 2014–2016 in Finland. Using factor analysis, three ICT skills factors were created: basic digital skills, advanced technical skills, and professional ICT skills. The performance in the ICT skill test was also divided by gender, as the male students and teachers outperformed the female students and teacher. Outperformance also occurred by educational level, as both upper secondary level students and teachers were seen as possessing higher-level ICT skills than students and teachers at the comprehensive level. We thus argue that to compare the ICT skills and the validity of the assessments, we needed to ensure consistent assessment for both students and teachers. In addition, in order to diminish the ICT skill gap among students, interventions using formal education are urgently needed, and in particular, more attention should be given to both teacher training and in-service training.",2018,06/,Universal Access in the Information Society,17,2,349-60,,10.1007/s10209-017-0553-9,,#738,Kaarakainen 2018,"",""

Researchers' attitudes towards the <i>h</i>-index on Twitter 2007-2020: criticism and acceptance,"Thelwall, M.; Kousha, K.","The h-index is an indicator of the scientific impact of an academic publishing career.

Nevertheless, it is well-known by academics, used in some promotion decisions, and is prominent in bibliometric databases, such as Google Scholar. In the context of this apparent conflict, it is important to understand researchers' attitudes towards the h-index. This article used public tweets in English to analyse how scholars discuss the h-index in public: is it mentioned, are tweets about it positive or negative, and has interest decreased since its shortcomings were exposed?

Two decades of research on board gender diversity and financial outcomes: Mapping heterogeneity and future research agenda,"Laique, U.; Abdullah, F.; Rehman, I.U.; Sergi, B.S.","This study seeks to comprehend the sources of substantial heterogeneity in the findings of board gender diversity and firm financial performance over the last two decades. We present an explanatory framework primarily ignored in previous review studies and chronologically review theoretical perspectives, analytical frameworks, measures, associations, and methodologies from 1996 to 2022. We employ a four-step systematic review methodology and a three-point thematic analysis framework. Our findings provide an explanatory framework outlining various channels that impede and facilitate the impact of board gender diversity on firms' financial outcomes. Our review reveals a plethora of descriptive studies that focused solely on one rather than multiple theoretical perspectives, which is a potential limitation and the root cause of heterogeneity in existing study findings. Heterogeneity is also linked with differences across studies in capturing firm performance, statistical inquiry, periods of studies, study samples, gender diversity of independent board members, family or non-family affiliations, omitted variable bias, the proportion of women directors on corporate boards, and economic contexts. Another reason for disparities in existing research is that gender diversity is not the only measure of diversity. Consequently, it is unclear when and which kind of board diversity measure should capture a firm's financial performance. We highlight the significance of the complexity perspective to address the limitation of measuring firm financial performance intently as a function of BGD from a singular theoretical perspective. Further, to better understand the antecedents of BGD, studies should use psychological and behavioural perspectives via an interview-based research design to encapsulate the team and individual attributes of BGD. Based upon our review, we suggest that future research should consider cultural differences to understand the antecedents of BGD on firm financial performance. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",2023,/,Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management,,,2121-44,,10.1002/csr.2510,,#741,Laique 2023,"",""
Comprehensive evaluation of farmland water conservancy facilities supply performance considering differential farmer income,"Jia, Xiaohu; Ma, Hengyun; Zhu, Yuchun","The evaluation index system of farmland water conservancy facilities' supply level was constructed in this paper, and the factor analysis method was adopted to evaluate the supply level. The min-max standardization process was then used to standardize the supply level and farmers' satisfaction for 180 villages investigated, the values were taken between 0 and 1, and then the mean values of the two were taken to characterize the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities. Finally, the hierarchical linear model was used to investigate the effect of influencing factors on farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance from village level and farmer level, and analyze the way of influencing factors to affect irrigation facilities' supply performance, especially the farmers' agricultural income differences. Research shows that farmland water conservancy facilities' supply level in China is below the international average level, farmers' satisfaction of farmland water conservancy facilities has not reached rational expectations, and there is still great room for the farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance to improve. The empirical analysis of the zero model suggests that there are differences in the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities between different villages, and the factors of villages and farmers affect the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities jointly, 48.8% caused by the factors of villages. Random intercept model was used to analyze the influence degree and direction of factors of villages and farmers. From the factors of villages, the number of motor-pumped wells, the length of channel and the collection rate of water fee have a significant positive effect on farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance. The effect of agricultural income difference is significant at 5% level, and presents an inverted U-shaped relationship, and the distance away from the county doesn't have a significant influence on the farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance. From the factors of farmers, the attention given by the government, the management of farmland water conservancy facilities, the changes of farmland water conservancy facilities in recent 5 years, comparison situation with nearby villages, convenience of irrigation and the satisfied degree to requirement of farmers have a significant positive influence on the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities; whether children attend school has a significant negative influence on the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities.

Gap theory based performance analysis: A case study of an Indian hostel building with passive architectural character,"Valiyappurakkal, V.K.","Meeting diversified expectations of users is a constant challenge. Only limited studies examine the perception as expectation and satisfaction of hostel building indoor environments, especially in India. This identified research gap is addressed in this study to propose a systematic indicative post-occupancy evaluation method using gap theory under the SERVQUAL model. Through site visits and focus group meetings, six main performance aspects of the hostel’s facilities were identified: visual comfort, thermal comfort, aural comfort, fire safety, hygiene, and communication. Further, a perception survey had conducted for 234 users. The thermal and hygiene aspects had shown the least expectation and satisfaction, while fire safety was the highest. This gives the idea of the preconception of users on aspects. Further, the perceptions were evaluated based on user subgroups such as gender (male and female), room type (single and double), academic year (1 and > 1), and course (UG and PG). The results show that females, single rooms, academic year > 1, and PG hold expectations higher. The service gaps range from -0.09 (fire) to -1.05 (hygiene), where this gap can be reversed.

Then, feature extraction is performed to extract features, such as statistical and spectral. Feature selection is done using Fuzzy information gain that suggests appropriate choices for future processing, and finally, seizure prediction is done using hybrid ResneXt-LeNet, which is a combination of ResneXt and Lenet.

Several automated algorithms have been proposed although manual segmentation remains the benchmark. Choosing a reliable algorithm is problematic since structural definition pertaining to multiple edges, missing and fuzzy boundaries, and shape changes varies among mTLE subjects. Lack of statistical references and guidance for quantifying the reliability and reproducibility of automated techniques has further detracted from automated approaches. The purpose of this study was to develop a systematic and statistical approach using a large dataset for the evaluation of automated methods and establish a method that would achieve results better approximating those attained by manual tracing in the epileptogenic hippocampus. Methods: A template database of 195 (81 males, 114 females; age range 32-67 yr, mean 49.16 yr) MR images of mTLE patients was used in this study. Hippocampal segmentation was accomplished manually and by two well-known tools (FreeSurfer and hammer) and two previously published methods developed at their institution [Automatic brain structure segmentation (ABSS) and LocalInfo]. To establish which method was better performing for mTLE cases, several voxel-based, distance-based, and volume-based performance metrics were considered. Statistical validations of the results using automated techniques were compared with the results of benchmark manual segmentation. Extracted metrics were analyzed to find the method that provided a more similar result relative to the benchmark. Results: Among the four automated methods, ABSS generated the most accurate results. For this method, the Dice coefficient was 5.13%, 14.10%, and 16.67% higher, Hausdorff was 22.65%, 86.73%, and 69.58% lower, precision was 4.94%, −4.94%, and 12.35% higher, and the root mean square (RMS) was 19.05%, 61.90%, and 65.08% lower than LocalInfo, FreeSurfer, and hammer, respectively. The Bland-Altman similarity analysis revealed a low bias for the ABSS and LocalInfo techniques compared to the others. Conclusions: The ABSS method for automated hippocampal segmentation outperformed other methods, best approximating what could be achieved by manual tracing. This study also shows that four categories of input data can cause automated segmentation methods to fail. They include incomplete studies, artifact, low signal-to-noise ratio, and inhomogeneity.

From characteristics to practical applications of skin temperature in thermal comfort research – A comprehensive review,"Zhao, Jiaqi; Wang, Rui; Wu, Yeyu; Zhao, Chaoyi; Qi, Yun; Li, Sishi; Jiang, Haihua; Cao, Bin","Skin temperature is a widely used physiological parameter in thermal comfort research. It serves as an indicator of personnel's thermal comfort and has the potential to guide the regulation of thermal conditions in future indoor environment designs. This study reviews relevant publications from 2013 to late 2023, focusing on population differences in skin temperature (local characteristics, age, gender, etc.), changing characteristics in different environments (dynamic and non-uniform environment, sleep environment, outdoor environment, etc.), and the application of skin temperature in thermal sensation prediction and performance evaluation of devices. This study clarifies the effectiveness of skin temperature in characterizing the thermal state of the human body through a review of existing research. It also proposes directions for future work considering research limitations in personal comfort models and performance evaluation of devices. The study suggests that skin temperature is likely to play a significant role in the future due to the development of technologies such as big data and the Internet of Things.

OK computer: Worker perceptions of algorithmic recruitment,"Fumagalli, Elena; Rezaei, Sarah; Salomons, Anna","We provide evidence on how workers on an online platform perceive algorithmic versus human recruitment through two incentivized experiments designed to elicit willingness to pay for human or algorithmic evaluation. In particular, we test how information on workers’ performance affects their recruiter choice and whether the algorithmic recruiter is perceived as more or less gender-biased than the human one. We find that workers do perceive human and algorithmic evaluation differently, even though both recruiters are given the same inputs in our controlled setting. Specifically, human recruiters are perceived to be more error-prone evaluators and place more weight on personal characteristics, whereas algorithmic recruiters are seen as placing more weight on task performance. Consistent with these perceptions, workers with good task performance relative to others prefer algorithmic evaluation, whereas those with lower task performance prefer human evaluation. We also find suggestive evidence that perceived differences in gender bias drive preferences for human versus algorithmic recruitment. © 2021",2022,,Research Policy,51,2,,,10.1016/j.respol.2021.104420,,#752,Fumagalli 2022,"",""
Are men better negotiators everywhere? A meta-analysis of how gender differences in negotiation performance vary across cultures,"Shan, W.; Keller, J.; Joseph, D.","Prior research has found that each culture and gender influences negotiation strategies and outcomes, but less is known about their interplay. We integrate these two research streams by providing a meta-analytic review of the interactive impact of gender and culture on negotiation performance. We reviewed 185 studies that reported gender differences in intracultural negotiation performance across 30 societies that varied across seven cultural dimensions. Results showed that Hofstede's individualism–collectivism, GLOBE's in-group collectivism and assertiveness practices, and Schwartz's harmony moderated the gender effect on negotiation performance. We found that in cultures lower in individualism, higher in in-group collectivism practices, lower in assertiveness practices, and higher in harmony, women more likely outperformed men in negotiations.

To assess the Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability of FPI-6 total score and individual scores in static foot posture evaluation among elderly female patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), aiming to establish the reliability of the FPI-6 scale. 2. To investigate the disparity between dominant and non-dominant quadriceps characteristics in elderly female KOA patients, as well as explore the correlation between quadriceps characteristics and abnormal foot posture, thereby offering novel insights for the prevention and treatment of KOA.MethodsThe study enrolled a total of 80 lower legs of 40 participants (all female) with unilateral or bilateral KOA, who were assessed by two raters at three different time points. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the FPI-6 was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), while the absolute reliability of FPI-6 was examined using the standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman analysis. The internal consistency of FPI-6 was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Additionally, MyotonPRO was employed to assess quadriceps muscle tone and stiffness in all participants, and the association between quadriceps muscle tone/stiffness and the total score of FPI-6 was analyzed.ResultOur study found excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability (ICC values of 0.923 and 0.931, respectively) for the FPI-6 total score, as well as good to excellent reliability (ICC values ranging from 0.680 to 0.863 and 0.739-0.883) for individual items. The SEM and MDC values for the total score of FPI-6 among our study inter-rater were 0.78 and 2.15, respectively. and the SEM and MDC values for the test-retest total score of FPI-6 were found to be 0.76 and 2.11, respectively. Furthermore, the SEM and MDC values between inter-rater and test-retest across six individual items ranged from 0.30 to 0.56 and from 0.84 to 1.56. The Bland-Altman plots and respective 95% LOA showed no evidence of systematic bias. In terms of the mechanical properties of the quadriceps on both sides, the muscle tone and stiffness of rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), and vastus lateralis (VL) were significantly higher in the non-dominant leg compared to the dominant leg. Additionally, in the non-dominant leg, there was a significant positive correlation between the muscle tone and stiffness of VM, VL, RF and the total score of FPI-6. However, in the dominant leg, only VM's muscle tone and stiffness showed a significant positive correlation with the total score of FPI-6.ConclusionThe reliability of the FPI-6 total score and its six individual items was good to excellent. Our findings offer a straightforward and dependable approach for researchers to assess foot posture in elderly female patients with KOA. Furthermore, we observed significantly greater quadriceps tension and stiffness in the non-dominant leg compared to the dominant leg. The FPI-6 total score exhibited a significant correlation with changes in quadriceps muscle performance among KOA patients. These observations regarding the relationship between changes in quadriceps muscle performance and foot posture in elderly female KOA patients may provide novel insights for disease prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.

The effect of bra design on wearing appearance,"Wang, Yilun; Ji, Xiaofen; Pang, Chen; Zhai, Lina","Purpose: Esthetic trend changes with the development of society and cultural differences. A minimizer bra designed to make breasts appear smaller is now popular with large-breasted women in China. To conform to the requirements of modern aesthetics in China, this paper aims to investigate vital features of breast appearance that influence people’s subjective evaluation of breast size and analyze how bra design parameters affect breast shape and make breasts appear smaller. Design/methodology/approach: This study used 3D scanning technology and reverse engineering software to obtain objective breast measurements in detail. A subjective evaluation experiment was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of seven minimizer bras compared to a basic comparison bra. Around 20 design parameters of 8 sample bras were identified to make a further study about the correlation between bra design features and breast shaping effect. To gain a deeper understanding of how bras interact with breast tissue, this study presented heat maps of the breast surface to visualize the deformation of breast shape. Findings: Nine breasts' characteristics, such as the distance between bust points, breast depth, outer breast curvature and slope, etc. have been determined to be highly correlated with the visual reduction effect of breasts. In addition, for the bras in this experiment, the high-performance bra for women with large breasts tends to have a wider side panel, a wider under band, higher gore and a stronger transverse rigidity of the bra cup. According to the observation of heat maps of the breast surface, soft full-figure bras provide a wider range of compression to the breasts and effectively flatten the breasts. Originality/value: This paper first aimed at the need to shape the ideal breast appearance for large-breasted women and make a further study of several hot-selling minimizer bras in China.

Context and person-oriented leader in teams: a meta-analytical review,"Ceri-Booms, M.","Purpose - The research studies the role of contextual moderating variables on the relationship between person-oriented leadership behaviors (POLBs) and team performance. The authors claim that the varying effect sizes between POLBs and team performance are large because of the context the team is functioning in. Therefore, based on the framework of Johns (2006), this paper aims to investigate the moderating role of the relevant demographic (leader gender), social (in-group collectivism and team size), task (skill differentiation) and methodological (common method bias and the rater of the team performance) contextual variables in the study. Design/methodology/approach - The authors accumulated evidence from 48 independent primary studies (N team = 4,276) to run the meta-analytic analyses. The authors followed the procedures described by Schmidt and Hunter (2015). For the categorical moderators, the analyzes were aided by the Hunter-Schmidt meta-analysis programs (2.0) (Schmidt and Le, 2014), which is an interactive software using a random-effects model. In the analyzes for the continuous moderators, the authors used Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) statistical package for the social sciences macros and run meta-regressions using a random-effects model with unrestricted maximum likelihood. Findings - The results indicate that the relationship weakens when female leaders exhibit these behaviors and when the team size increases. On the other hand, in-group collectivism strengthens the relationship. The study also found that the common method bias and the assessment method of the team performance are significant moderators altering the relationship. Practical implications - The study highlights the perceptual differences and biases based on leader gender. Acknowledging these biases may help practitioners to appreciate the female qualities in leadership and decrease the undervaluation of female effectiveness. To create high-performing teams, leaders in high ingroup collectivist countries are expected to develop a family feeling in the team by showing their concern for personal issues and build close interpersonal relationships. Researchers should use multiple sources to assess the predictor and criterion variables and also opt for more objective assessment methods for team performance. Originality/value - With this study, the authors follow a substantively different perspective compared to the past meta-analytic reviews on this relationship. Rather than testing the inquiry whether there is a relationship between the two variables, the authors specifically focus on the role of contextual moderating variables. Several researchers have acknowledged that contextual considerations are critical in leadershipteam performance research. Nevertheless, the body of research remains to be not cohesive. Thus, the study answers a call in the leadership area for a more context-based and cohesive understanding of the effects of leadership on team performance.",2020,/,Team Performance Management: An International Journal,26,1-2,91-121,,10.1108/TPM-11-2019-0111,,#759,Ceri-Booms 2020,"",""

Robotic and clinical evaluation of upper limb motor performance in patients with Friedreich’s Ataxia: an observational study,"Germanotta, M.; Vasco, G.; Petrarca, M.; Rossi, S.; Carniel, S.; Bertini, E.; Cappa, P.; Castelli, E.","Background: Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary autosomal recessive form of ataxia. In this disease there is early manifestation of gait ataxia, and dysmetria of the arms and legs which causes impairment in daily activities that require fine manual dexterity. To date there is no cure for this disease. Some novel therapeutic approaches are ongoing in different steps of clinical trial. Development of sensitive outcome measures is crucial to prove therapeutic effectiveness. The aim of the study was to assess the reliability and sensitivity of quantitative and objective assessment of upper limb performance computed by means of the robotic device and to evaluate the correlation with clinical and functional markers of the disease severity. Methods: Here we assess upper limb performances by means of the InMotion Arm Robot, a robot designed for clinical neurological applications, in a cohort of 14 children and young adults affected by FRDA, matched for age and gender with 18 healthy subjects. We focused on the analysis of kinematics, accuracy, smoothness, and submovements of the upper limb while reaching movements were performed. The robotic evaluation of upper limb performance consisted of planar reaching movements performed with the robotic system. The motors of the robot were turned off, so that the device worked as a measurement tool. The status of the disease was scored using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Relationships between robotic indices and a range of clinical and disease characteristics were examined. Results: All our robotic indices were significantly different between the two cohorts except for two, and were highly and reliably discriminative between healthy and subjects with FRDA. In particular, subjects with FRDA exhibited slower movements as well as loss of accuracy and smoothness, which are typical of the disease. Duration of Movement, Normalized Jerk, and Number of Submovements were the best discriminative indices, as they were directly and easily measurable and correlated with the status of the disease, as measured by SARA.

Production performance optimization of water-enhanced geothermal system based on effective time-averaged volume,"Ma, Weiwu; Xu, Yifan; Ahmed, Shams Forruque; Yang, Chong; Liu, Gang","Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) hold great promise for geothermal energy extraction. However, accurately evaluating reservoirs and fractures remains a primary challenge in optimizing the production performance of EGS. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel index, the effective time-averaged volume. It assesses the effectiveness of reservoirs and fractures, and system economy, making it a valuable tool for determining effective utilization times. Through establishing a triple-well fractured model, parametric studies are innovatively conducted. Results indicate that a reduced effective time-averaged volume leads to a higher thermal recovery rate and greater power generation. The optimized parameters of the model are a reservoir permeability of 0.5 mD, a primary fracture permeability of 50 D, an injection flow rate of 45 kg/s, an injection temperature of 20 °C, and a well spacing of 200 m. The cumulative power generation and effective time-averaged volume of the reservoir for 45 years are 4.89 × 106 GJ and 4.78 × 108 m3, respectively. Furthermore, we quantify the contributions of influencing factors to production performance, highlighting the significant impact of injection flow rate on system economy.

A DEA evaluation of U.S. States’ healthcare systems in terms of their birth outcomes,"Darabi, Negar; Ebrahimvandi, Alireza; Hosseinichimeh, Niyousha; Triantis, Konstantinos","States vary substantially in terms of infant mortality and preterm birth rates. Despite all the attention and effort at the national level in improving birth outcomes, many states’ healthcare systems are still suffering from high rates of unfavorable birth outcomes. Hence, the important question is what makes a healthcare system more successful when evaluating birth outcomes at the state level. To answer this question, we build a state–level database using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kaiser Family Foundation, and Area Health Resources File. Then, we implement a mixed-methods approach that includes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), robust principal component analysis, bootstrapping, and statistical characteristics methods such as truncated regression to systematically compare and contrast the performance of 50 state's healthcare systems with respect to their birth outcomes (i.e., infant mortality, preterm birth, and low birthweight) and to provide benchmarks. Our findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic factors such as the poverty rate and the number of African-American women per 1000 population significantly explain the major variation in healthcare systems’ performance in terms of their birth outcomes. Therefore, disregarding these environmental factors leads to an overestimation of the system's efficiency. Furthermore, our work contributes to the body of literature by introducing a unique application in the domain of efficiency performance measurement of states’ healthcare systems in the U.S., using a unique dataset that has not been analyzed before, identifying efficient and inefficient states, providing peers for each inefficient state and indicating how those inefficient states can make improvement in their performance, and providing unique policy insights. © 2021",2021,,Expert Systems with Applications,182,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115278,,#765,Darabi 2021,"",""
Dietary phytochemicals as a promising nutritional strategy for sarcopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Jeong, Hye Yun; Kwon, Oran","The decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength, also called sarcopenia, accelerates with age, leading to negative health outcomes and poor quality of life.

To maintain the restored vertebral height and reduce the reliance on cement as the major stabilizer, an expandable vertebral augment system (EVA®) made of titanium alloy consisting of a rigid tube encased by a barrel with an anterior expansion mechanism was developed. The aim of the current study was to determine whether this novel design is as effective as existing procedures in terms of height restoration and biomechanical performance. Eight osteoporotic vertebrae (T12-L3) confirmed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from two fresh-frozen human cadavers (70- and 72-year-old females) were used. Twenty-five percent reduced anterior wedge vertebral compression fractures were created using a material testing machine. Four randomized specimens were augmented with EVA® (Chang Gu Biotechnology Co.

Cross-population evaluation of cervical cancer risk prediction algorithms,"Elvatun, S.; Knoors, D.; Nygard, M.; Uuskula, A.; Vork, A.; Nygard, J.F.","BackgroundCervical cancer is a preventable disease, despite being one of the most common types of female cancers worldwide. Integrating existing programs for cervical cancer screening with personalized risk prediction algorithms can improve population-level cancer prevention by enabling more targeted screening and contrive preventive healthcare innovations. While algorithms developed for cervical cancer risk prediction have shown promising performance in internal validation on more homogeneous populations, their ability to generalize to external populations remains to be assessed.MethodsTo address this gap, we perform a cross-population comparative study of personalized prediction algorithms for more personalized cervical cancer screening. Using data from the Norwegian and Estonian populations, the algorithms are validated on internal and external datasets to study their potential biases and limitations when applied to different populations. We evaluate the algorithms in predicting progression from low-grade precancerous cervical lesions, simulating a clinically relevant application of more personalized risk stratification.ResultsAs expected, our numerical experiments show that algorithm performance varies depending on the population. However, some algorithms show strong generalization capacity across different data sources. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, we demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the algorithms in detecting cancer progression over time by comparing to the trends observed from data. We assess their overall discrimination performance in personalized risk predictions by analyzing the accuracy and confidence in individual risk estimates.Discussion and ConclusionThis study examines the effectiveness of personalized prediction algorithms across different populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for generalizing risk prediction algorithms to external populations.

Deep learning evaluation of echocardiograms to identify occult atrial fibrillation,"Yuan, Neal; Stein, Nathan R.; Duffy, Grant; Sandhu, Roopinder K.; Chugh, Sumeet S.; Chen, Peng-Sheng; Rosenberg, Carine; Albert, Christine M.; Cheng, Susan; Siegel, Robert J.; Ouyang, David","Atrial fibrillation (AF) often escapes detection, given its frequent paroxysmal and asymptomatic presentation. Deep learning of transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs), which have structural information, could help identify occult AF. We created a two-stage deep learning algorithm using a video-based convolutional neural network model that (1) distinguished whether TTEs were in sinus rhythm or AF and then (2) predicted which of the TTEs in sinus rhythm were in patients who had experienced AF within 90 days. Our model, trained on 111,319 TTE videos, distinguished TTEs in AF from those in sinus rhythm with high accuracy in a held-out test cohort (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.96), AUPRC 0.91 (0.90–0.92)). Among TTEs in sinus rhythm, the model predicted the presence of concurrent paroxysmal AF (AUC 0.74 (0.71–0.77), AUPRC 0.19 (0.16–0.23)). Model discrimination remained similar in an external cohort of 10,203 TTEs (AUC of 0.69 (0.67–0.70), AUPRC 0.34 (0.31–0.36)). Performance held across patients who were women (AUC 0.76 (0.72–0.81)), older than 65 years (0.73 (0.69–0.76)), or had a CHA2DS2VASc ≥2 (0.73 (0.79–0.77)). The model performed better than using clinical risk factors (AUC 0.64 (0.62–0.67)), TTE measurements (0.64 (0.62–0.67)), left atrial size (0.63 (0.62–0.64)), or CHA2DS2VASc (0.61 (0.60–0.62)). An ensemble model in a cohort subset combining the TTE model with an electrocardiogram (ECGs) deep learning model performed better than using the ECG model alone (AUC 0.81 vs. 0.79, p = 0.01). Deep learning using TTEs can predict patients with active or occult AF and could be used for opportunistic AF screening that could lead to earlier treatment. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.",2024,,npj Digital Medicine,7,1,,,10.1038/s41746-024-01090-z,,#769,Yuan 2024,"",""
Comparison and benchmark of name-to- gender inference services,"Santamaria, Lucia; Mihaljevi, Helena","The increased interest in analyzing and explaining gender inequalities in tech, media, and academia highlights the need for accurate inference methods to predict a person's gender from their name.

Should the research performance of scientists be distinguished by gender?,"Abramo, Giovanni; Cicero, Tindaro; D'Angelo, Ciriaco Andrea","The literature on gender differences in research performance seems to suggest a gap between men and women, where the former outperform the latter. Whether one agrees with the different factors proposed to explain the phenomenon, it is worthwhile to verify if comparing the performance within each gender, rather than without distinction, gives significantly different ranking lists. If there were some structural factor that determined a penalty in performance of female researchers compared to their male peers, then under conditions of equal capacities of men and women, any comparative evaluations of individual performance that fail to account for gender differences would lead to distortion of the judgments in favor of men. In this work we measure the extent of differences in rank between the two methods of comparing performance in each field of the hard sciences: for professors in the Italian university system, we compare the distributions of research performance for men and women and subsequently the ranking lists with and without distinction by gender.

On the limits of automatic speaker verification: Explaining degraded recognizer scores through acoustic changes resulting from voice disguise,"Gonzalez Hautamaki, Rosa; Hautamaki, Ville; Kinnunen, Tomi","In speaker verification research, objective performance benchmarking of listeners and automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are of key importance in understanding the limits of speaker recognition. While the adoption of common data and metrics has been instrumental to progress in ASV, there are two major shortcomings. First, the utterances lack intentional voice changes imposed by the speaker. Second, the standard evaluation metrics focus on average performance across all speakers and trials. As a result, a knowledge gap remains in how the acoustic changes impact recognition performance at the level of individual speakers. This paper addresses the limits of speaker recognition in ASV systems under voice disguise using a linear mixed effects model to analyze the impact of change in long-term statistics of selected features (formants F1-F4, the bandwidths B1-B4, F0, and speaking rate) to ASV log-likelihood ratio (LLR) score. The correlations between the proposed predictive model and the LLR scores are 0.72 for females and 0.81 for male speakers.

However, there is still a significant gap in research when it comes to understanding and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in the field of mental health. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We conduct a broad range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction fine-tuning. The results indicate a promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform the best prompt design of GPT-3.5 (25 and 15 times bigger) by 10.9% on balanced accuracy and the best of GPT-4 (250 and 150 times bigger) by 4.8%. They further perform on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific language model. We also conduct an exploratory case study on LLMs’ capability on mental health reasoning tasks, illustrating the promising capability of certain models such as GPT-4. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for potential methods to enhance LLMs’ capability for mental health tasks.

Person retrieval in surveillance using textual query: a review,"Galiyawala, Hiren; Raval, Mehul S.","Recent advancement of research in biometrics, computer vision, and natural language processing has discovered opportunities for person retrieval from surveillance videos using textual query. The prime objective of a surveillance system is to locate a person using a description, e.g., a short woman with a pink t-shirt and white skirt carrying a black purse. She has brown hair. Such a description contains attributes like gender, height, type of clothing, colour of clothing, hair colour, and accessories. Such attributes are formally known as soft biometrics. They help bridge the semantic gap between a human description and a machine as a textual query contains the person’s soft biometric attributes. It is also not feasible to manually search through huge volumes of surveillance footage to retrieve a specific person. Hence, automatic person retrieval using vision and language-based algorithms is becoming popular. In comparison to other state-of-the-art reviews, the contribution of the paper is as follows: 1. Recommends most discriminative soft biometrics for specific challenging conditions. 2. Integrates benchmark datasets and retrieval methods for objective performance evaluation. 3.

Specifically, the challenge entails addressing the phenomenon of asynchronous switching between the controlled object and the observer, where there is a delay between the switching of the subsystems and the observer.

A Comparison and Evaluation of Stereo Matching on Active Stereo Images,"Jang, Mingyu; Yoon, Hyunse; Lee, Seongmin; Kang, Jiwoo; Lee, Sanghoon","The relationship between the disparity and depth information of corresponding pixels is inversely proportional. Thus, in order to accurately estimate depth from stereo vision, it is important to obtain accurate disparity maps, which encode the difference between horizontal coordinates of corresponding image points. Stereo vision can be classified as either passive or active. Active stereo vision generates pattern texture, which passive stereo vision does not have, on the image to fill the textureless regions. In passive stereo vision, many surveys have discovered that disparity accuracy is heavily reliant on attributes, such as radiometric variation and color variation, and have found the best-performing conditions. However, in active stereo matching, the accuracy of the disparity map is influenced not only by those affecting the passive stereo technique, but also by the attributes of the generated pattern textures. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze and evaluate the relationship between the performance of the active stereo technique and the attributes of pattern texture. When evaluating, experiments are conducted under various settings, such as changing the pattern intensity, pattern contrast, number of pattern dots, and global gain, that may affect the overall performance of the active stereo matching technique. Through this evaluation, our discovery can act as a noteworthy reference for constructing an active stereo system. © 2022 by the authors.

Radiomics robustness assessment and classification evaluation: A two-stage method demonstrated on multivendor FFDM,"Robinson, Kayla; Li, Hui; Lan, Li; Schacht, David; Giger, Maryellen","Purpose: Radiomic texture analysis is typically performed on images acquired under specific, homogeneous imaging conditions. These controlled conditions may not be representative of the range of imaging conditions implemented clinically. We aim to develop a two-stage method of radiomic texture analysis that incorporates the reproducibility of individual texture features across imaging conditions to guide the development of texture signatures which are robust across mammography unit vendors. Methods: Full-field digital mammograms were retrospectively collected for women who underwent screening mammography on both a Hologic Lorad Selenia and GE Senographe 2000D system. Radiomic features were calculated on manually placed regions of interest in each image. In stage one (robustness assessment), we identified a set of nonredundant features that were reproducible across the two different vendors. This was achieved through hierarchical clustering and application of robustness metrics. In stage two (classification evaluation), we performed stepwise feature selection and leave-one-out quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to construct radiomic signatures. We refer to this two-state method as robustness assessment, classification evaluation (RACE). These radiomic signatures were used to classify the risk of breast cancer through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, using the area under the ROC curve as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between women with and without high-risk factors present. Generalizability was investigated by comparing the classification performance of a feature set on the images from which they were selected (intravendor) to the classification performance on images from the vendor on which it was not selected (intervendor). Intervendor and intravendor performances were also compared to the performance obtained by implementing ComBat, a feature-level harmonization method and to the performance by implementing ComBat followed by RACE.

A Hybrid Model for Fitness Influencer Competency Evaluation Framework,"Yang, C.-C.; Hsu, W.-C.J.; Yeh, C.-S.; Lin, Y.-S.","Fitness influencers are an emerging profession in recent years. At present, the main research on fitness influencers focuses on their personal traits, professional knowledge and skills, and course content, while there is still a large research gap on the social media marketing strategies of fitness influencers, how they interact with fans, and the reasons for their influence on fans. There is a lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework for fitness influencer research, and there is no clear research on what competencies are required to become a qualified fitness influencer. Therefore, it has become an important issue to establish a comprehensive fitness influencer competency evaluation. In this study, a hybrid model of fitness influencer competency evaluation framework was developed based on government competency standards and expert knowledge using the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model perspective. This evaluation should expand to include the principles of sustainable development, emphasizing the influencers' role in advocating for environmental responsibility, social equity, and economic viability within the fitness industry. First, the study developed 21 criteria in six dimensions of fitness influencer competencies through a literature survey and interviews with several experts. The 21 criteria resonate with many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The Bayesian Best-Worst Method (Bayesian BWM) was used to generate the best group weights for fitness influencer competencies.

In stages 2 and 3, we propose: (1) a projection-based DC block that confirms defect presence in two 2D orthogonal orientations and (2) a calibration method that ""learns""the mapping from the features of stage 2 to the distribution of observer ratings from the human observer rating data (thus modeling inter- or intraobserver variability) using a mixture density network. We implemented and evaluated the DeepAMO in the context of Tc99m-DMSA SPECT imaging. A human observer study was conducted, with two medical imaging physics graduate students serving as observers. A 5 × 2-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted to test the statistical equivalence in defect detection performance between the DeepAMO and the human observer. We also compared the performance of the DeepAMO to an unoptimized implementation of a scanning linear discriminant observer (SLDO). Results: The results show that the DeepAMO's and human observer's performances on unseen images were statistically equivalent with a margin of difference ( ""AUC) of 0.0426 at p  © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",2021,,Journal of Medical Imaging,8,4,,,10.1117/1.JMI.8.4.041204,,#789,Li 2021,"",""
The Measurement Method of the Impact Force of Shoulder Tackle and the Influence of the Lower-Extremity Strength on the Impact Force of Shoulder Tackle in Rugby Players,"Song, Xiaoneng; Wang, Lei; Xu, Hui","With the rapid development of Internet of things engineering, intelligent sports products are gradually understood by people, providing help for the health and performance of athletes. In rugby training, coaches record and observe the force of data only based on their own experience; the impact force (IF) of shoulder tackle (ST) is a key defensive ability evaluation component for rugby players. However, the information related to female rugby players is limited. Purpose. To understand the strength characteristics of the lower-extremity of rugby players and to develop theoretical references for ST training. Methods. The force sensing device is made with FLexiForceTMA502 pressure sensor, its data acquisition adopts LabVIEW and USB. The strength of the lower extremity was tested by IsoMed 2000, and the IF of ST was measured by a testing system among eighteen Chinese female rugby players, respectively. Results. (1) The reliability and validity of the impact force tester are tested by comparing the actual load with the calibration value and the difference and correlation between the actual load value of different loads and the calibration value of it. (2) At 60°/s and 180°/s, the PT (PT) and relative PT (PT/BW) of bilateral lower-extremity extensors were greater than the flexors. (3) The flexor/extensor PT ratio of the left knee at 60°/s was higher than the right knee. (4) The linear regression equation was established between PT of dominant-side knee extensors and IF of ST. The coefficient β of the linear regression equation was 0.866, 0.862, 0.892, 0.722, 0.788, and 0.737, respectively. Conclusions. (1) The design uses LabVIEW, USB, and FLexiForceTM A502 pressure sensor to complete the overall construction of the data acquisition system and impact force sensing device. (2) It is feasible to use the extensor strength of the dominant-side knee joint as a reference index to evaluate the IF of ST. (3) The balanced development of the front/reverse ST techniques can enhance its defensive capacity of it. © 2022 Xiaoneng Song et al.",2022,,Mobile Information Systems,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/7653775,,#790,Song 2022,"",""
Sensitivity and specificity estimation using patient-specific microwave imaging in diverse experimental breast phantoms,"O'Loughlin, Declan; Oliveira, Barbara L.; Santorelli, Adam; Porter, Emily; Glavin, Martin; Jones, Edward; Popovic, Milica; O'Halloran, Martin","Many new clinical investigations of microwave breast imaging have been published in recent years. Trials with over one hundred participants have indicated the potential of microwave imaging to detect breast cancer, with particularly encouraging sensitivity results reported from women with dense breasts. The next phase of clinical trials will involve larger and more diverse populations, including women with no breast abnormalities or benign breast diseases. These trials will need to address clinical efficacy in terms of sensitivity and specificity. A number of challenges exist when using microwave imaging with broad populations: 1) addressing the substantial variance in breast composition observed in the population and 2) achieving high specificity given differences between individuals. This paper analyses these challenges using a diverse phantom set which models the variance in breast composition and tumor shape and size seen in the population. The data show that the sensitivity of microwave breast imaging in breasts of differing density can suffer if patient-specific beamforming is not used. Moreover, the results suggest that achieving high specificity in dense breasts may be difficult, but that patient-specific beamforming does not adversely affect the expected specificity. In summary, this paper finds that patient-specific beamforming has a tangible impact on expected sensitivity in experimental cases and that achieving high specificity in dense breasts may be challenging. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",2019,,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,38,1,303-311,,10.1109/TMI.2018.2864150,,#791,O'Loughlin 2019,"",""
Multimedia patient education to assist oral impression taking during dental treatment: a pilot study,Dandan Pei; Beilei Liang; Wenzhi Du; Peng Wang; Jie Liu; Min He; Yi Lu,"Introduction: Proper cooperation between patient and dentist is of great help to make a good oral impression. However, patients are frequently confused when information is given through traditional verbal description. The present study compared the effectiveness of the multimedia information delivery ways with the traditional verbal manner on patients’ understanding level in oral impression taking. Methods: The recruited 191 participating patients were randomly assigned to the control group (the verbal group) and two intervention groups (the video group and the picture group) according to the information delivery manner. After intervention, the patients’ understanding degree was measured by questionnaire and performance evaluation of behavior feedback on the provided information quantitatively. Also, patients’ self-assessment of satisfaction was interviewed by telephone. All data was analyzed by SPSS 14.0 software, and p ≤ 0.05 was set as significant difference in advance. Results: One-Way ANOVA and Chi-square showed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean age, gender composition, and educational level among the three groups (P > 0.05). In both questionnaire assessment and performance evaluation, One-Way ANOVA followed by LSD indicate that the video group gained a higher score than the verbal group or the picture group (P  0.05). Higher percentage of satisfaction was reported by patients in the two multimedia groups than that in the control group. Discussion: Oral impression taking is a consecutive process that requires action cooperation between dentists and patients simultaneously. This particularity makes it more suitable for multimedia delivery. The delivery of tailored information using multimedia in this study was favored by most patients and could improve the degree of patient understanding of the oral impression taking procedures.

Benchmarking deep network architectures for ethnicity recognition using a new large face dataset,"Greco, Antonio; Percannella, Gennaro; Vento, Mario; Vigilante, Vincenzo","Although in recent years we have witnessed an explosion of the scientific research in the recognition of facial soft biometrics such as gender, age and expression with deep neural networks, the recognition of ethnicity has not received the same attention from the scientific community. The growth of this field is hindered by two related factors: on the one hand, the absence of a dataset sufficiently large and representative does not allow an effective training of convolutional neural networks for the recognition of ethnicity; on the other hand, the collection of new ethnicity datasets is far from simple and must be carried out manually by humans trained to recognize the basic ethnicity groups using the somatic facial features. To fill this gap in the facial soft biometrics analysis, we propose the VGGFace2 Mivia Ethnicity Recognition (VMER) dataset, composed by more than 3,000,000 face images annotated with 4 ethnicity categories, namely African American, East Asian, Caucasian Latin and Asian Indian. The final annotations are obtained with a protocol which requires the opinion of three people belonging to different ethnicities, in order to avoid the bias introduced by the well-known other race effect. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive performance analysis of popular deep network architectures, namely VGG-16, VGG-Face, ResNet-50 and MobileNet v2. Finally, we perform a cross-dataset evaluation to demonstrate that the deep network architectures trained with VMER generalize on different test sets better than the same models trained on the largest ethnicity dataset available so far.

3D Human cartilage surface characterization by optical coherence tomography,"Brill, Nicolai; Riedel, Jorn; Schmitt, Robert; Tingart, Markus; Truhn, Daniel; Pufe, Thomas; Jahr, Holger; Nebelung, Sven","Early diagnosis and treatment of cartilage degeneration is of high clinical interest. Loss of surface integrity is considered one of the earliest and most reliable signs of degeneration, but cannot currently be evaluated objectively. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an arthroscopically available light-based non-destructive real-time imaging technology that allows imaging at micrometre resolutions to millimetre depths. As OCT-based surface evaluation standards remain to be defined, the present study investigated the diagnostic potential of 3D surface profile parameters in the comprehensive evaluation of cartilage degeneration. To this end, 45 cartilage samples of different degenerative grades were obtained from total knee replacements (2 males, 10 females; mean age 63.8 years), cut to standard size and imaged using a spectral-domain OCT device (Thorlabs, Germany). 3D OCT datasets of 8 × 8, 4 × 4 and 1 × 1 mm (width × length) were obtained and pre-processed (image adjustments, morphological filtering). Subsequent automated surface identification algorithms were used to obtain the 3D primary profiles, which were then filtered and processed using established algorithms employing ISO standards. The 3D surface profile thus obtained was used to calculate a set of 21 3D surface profile parameters, i.e. height (e.g. Sa), functional (e.g. Sk), hybrid (e.g. Sdq) and segmentation-related parameters (e.g. Spd). Samples underwent reference histological assessment according to the Degenerative Joint Disease classification. Statistical analyses included calculation of Spearman's rho and assessment of inter-group differences using the Kruskal Wallis test. Overall, the majority of 3D surface profile parameters revealed significant degeneration-dependent differences and correlations with the exception of severe end-stage degeneration and were of distinct diagnostic value in the assessment of surface integrity. None of the 3D surface profile parameters investigated were capable of reliably differentiating healthy from early-degenerative cartilage, while scan area sizes considerably affected parameter values. In conclusion, cartilage surface integrity may be adequately assessed by 3D surface profile parameters, which should be used in combination for the comprehensive and thorough evaluation and overall improved diagnostic performance.

An on-device gender prediction method for mobile users using representative wordsets,Yerim Choi; Yoonjung Kim; Solee Kim; Kyuyon Park; Jonghun Park,"With the proliferation of mobile devices and the growing necessity for gender information in personalized intelligent systems, gender prediction of mobile users has become an important research issue. Text data in mobile devices are known to have high discriminative power for gender, but transmitting those data to the outside of a device has a security risk and raises a privacy concern of users. This study introduces an on-device gender prediction framework, by which the entire data analysis is performed inside a device minimizing the privacy risk. To cope with the resource limitation of mobile devices, gender information of a user is predicted by matching the user’s mobile text data against gender representative wordsets which are constructed from web documents using a word evaluation measure. From the experiments conducted on real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed framework was confirmed, and it was concluded that not only discriminability of a word but also popularity should be considered for the on-device gender prediction. The proposed framework is simple yet very powerful for gender prediction that its practical application to various expert and intelligent systems is possible attributed to the low computational complexity and high prediction performances.

Hydraulic modeling and prediction of performance for a drinking water supply system towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs): A system case study from Uganda,"Dadebo, Derrick; Obura, Denis; Kimera, David","The world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health, pollution, and ecosystem damage. Maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long-term demographic transition would achieve sustainability. This study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system, Najjembe Town water supply scheme, Uganda. Results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0.01 to 2.36 m/s. The pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario, and pipes never run full. Flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). The negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand. The proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure (TPIP) and velocity (TPIV) to 89.9–99.3% and 80.9–99.5%, respectively. The implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals (SDGs) interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2), promoting good human health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting gender equality (SDG 5), and economic growth (SDG 8). Defining the linkage between water supply management planning and SDGs would assist in the long-term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy-makers in the sector in making well-informed decisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,,Groundwater for Sustainable Development,22,,,,10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100951,,#800,Dadebo 2023,"",""

Hence, this study developed a novel sustainable irrigation matrix (SIM)-related model to evaluate four irrigation scenarios (a combination of furrow and drip techniques and chemical and nanomaterial fertilizers) in tomato cultivation to fulfill the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their targets. The SIM model included main criteria (three sustainability pillars), and sub-criteria, i.e., irrigation water and nitrogen use efficiency, nitrate leaching, N2O emission, energy input, crop yield, net return, hired farmworkers, education level, and percentage of irrigated area. Data collection included a pot-scale experiment, literature studies, and questionnaires. Results demonstrated that drip/nano-fertilization (DN) was the best irrigation technique, and it was highly influenced by the economic and environmental dimensions, followed by the social pillar of sustainability. Moreover, DN achieved the highest scores on all SDGs except for SDG5 ""gender equality"" and SDG16 ""peace, justice and participation"".

Statistical mechanical evaluation of a spread-spectrum watermarking model with image restoration,"Kawamura, Masaki; Hayashi, Kao; Uezu, Tatsuya; Okada, Masato","In cases in which an original image is blind, a decoding method where both the image and the messages can be estimated simultaneously is desirable. We propose a spread spectrum watermarking model with image restoration based on Bayes estimation. We therefore need to assume some prior probabilities. The probability for estimating the messages is given by the uniform distribution, and the ones for the image are given by the infinite-range model and two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. Any attacks from unauthorized users can be represented by channel models. We can obtain the estimated messages and image by maximizing the posterior probability. We analyzed the performance of the proposed method by the replica method in the case of the infinite-range model. We first calculated the theoretical values of the bit error rate from obtained saddle-point equations and then verified them by computer simulations. For this purpose, we assumed that the image is binary and is generated from a given prior probability. We also assume that attacks can be represented by the Gaussian channel. The computer simulation retults agreed with the theoretical values. In the case of prior probability given by the 2D Ising model, in which each pixel is statically connected with four-neighbors, we evaluated the decoding performance by computer simulations, since the replica theory could not be applied. Results using the 2D Ising model showed that the proposed method with image restoration is as effective as the infinite-range model for decoding messages. We compared the performances in a case in which the image was blind and one in which it was informed. The difference between these cases was small as long as the embedding and attack rates were small. This demonstrates that the proposed method with simultaneous estimation is effective as a watermarking decoder. © 2019 American Physical Society.",2019,,Physical Review E,99,6,,,10.1103/PhysRevE.99.062132,,#805,Kawamura 2019,"",""

An effective method for computerized prediction and segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MRI,"Roy, Sudipta; Bhattacharyya, Debnath; Bandyopadhyay, Samir Kumar; Kim, Tai-Hoon","Background and objectives Multiple sclerosis is one of the major diseases and the progressive MS lesion formation often leads to cognitive decline and physical disability. A quick and perfect method for estimating the number and size of MS lesions in the brain is very important in estimating the progress of the disease and effectiveness of treatments. But, the accurate identification, characterization and quantification of MS lesions in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely difficult due to the frequent change in location, size, morphology variation, intensity similarity with normal brain tissues, and inter-subject anatomical variation of brain images. Methods This paper presents a method where adaptive background generation and binarization using global threshold are the key steps for MS lesions detection and segmentation. After performing three phase level set, we add third phase segmented region with contour of brain to connect the normal tissues near the boundary. Then remove all lesions except maximum connected area and corpus callosum of the brain to generate adaptive background. The binarization method is used to select threshold based on entropy and standard deviation preceded by non-gamut image enhancement. The background image is then subtracted from binarized image to find out segmented MS lesions. Results The step of subtraction of background from binarized image does not generate spurious lesions. Binarization steps correctly identify the MS lesions and reduce over or under segmentation. The average Kappa index is 94.88%, Jacard index is 90.43%, correct detection ration is 92.60284%, false detection ratio is 2.55% and relative area error is 5.97% for proposed method. Existing recent methods does not have such accuracy and low value of error rate both mathematically as well as visually due to many spurious lesions generation and over segmentation problems. Conclusions Proposed method accurately identifies the size and number of lesions as well as location of lesions detection as a radiologist performs. The adaptability of the proposed method creates a number of potential opportunities for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI.

A Case of Specificity: How Does the Acoustic Voice Quality Index Perform in Normophonic Subjects?,"Batthyany, C.; Maryn, Y.; Trauwaen; Caelenberghe, E.; van Dinther, J.; Zarowski, A.; Wuyts, F.","The acoustic voice quality index (AVQI) is a multiparametric tool based on six acoustic measurements to quantify overall voice quality in an objective manner, with the smoothed version of the cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) as its main contributor. In the last decade, many studies demonstrated its robust diagnostic accuracy and high sensitivity to voice changes across voice therapy in different languages. The aim of the present study was to provide information regarding AVQI’s and CPPS’s performance in normophonic non-treatment-seeking subjects, since these data are still scarce; concatenated voice samples, consisting of sustained vowel phonation and continuous speech, from 123 subjects (72 females, 51 males; between 20 and 60 years old) without vocally relevant complaints were evaluated by three raters and run in AVQI v.02.06. According to this auditory-perceptual evaluation, two cohorts were set up (normophonia versus slight perceived dysphonia). First, gender effects were investigated. Secondly, between-cohort differences in AVQI and CPPS were investigated. Thirdly, with the number of judges giving G = 1 to partition three sub-levels of slight hoarseness as an independent factor, differences in AVQI and CPPS across these sub-levels were investigated; for AVQI, no significant gender effect was found, whereas, for CPPS, significant trends were observed. For both AVQI and CPPS, no significant differences were found between normophonic and slightly dysphonic subjects.

Use of community perceptions to evaluate and adapt coastal resource management practices in the Philippines,"Mudge, Laura","Coastal resource management (CRM) programs have been implemented in the Philippines since the 1980s with the specific intent to protect and rehabilitate coastal habitats and enhance the sustainability of coastal communities. However, the implementation of these programs alone does not guarantee the success of program objectives. Monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents. Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there is a high level of interest for participating in future management activities. This study exemplifies how perceptions and associated contextual information of the community provides invaluable insights into the effectiveness of coastal resource management and be incorporated into the adaptive management cycle. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Ocean and Coastal Management,163,,304-322,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.07.008,,#809,Mudge 2018,"",""
Multi criteria decision making approaches for green supplier evaluation and selection: A literature review,"Govindan, Kannan; Rajendran, Sivakumar; Sarkis, Joseph; Murugesan, P.","A large and growing body of literature to supplier evaluation and selection exists. Literature on green supplier evaluation that considers environmental factors are relatively limited. Recently, in supply chain management decision making, approaches for evaluating green supplier performance have used both qualitative and quantitative environmental data. Given this evolving research field, the goal and purpose of this paper is to analyze research in international scientific journals and international conference proceedings that focus on green supplier selection. We propose the following questions that will be answered: (i) which selection approaches are commonly applied?, (ii) what environmental and other selection criteria for green supplier management are popular?, (iii) and what limitations exist? Published research from 1997 to 2011 is structurally reviewed based on the first two questions. We find that the applied techniques are mostly fuzzy based single model approaches. The most common criterion considered for green supplier selection was ""environmental management systems"". A further critical analysis is completed and gaps in the current literature are identified. These gaps help us to identify improvements for green supplier selection process and possible future directions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,,Journal of Cleaner Production,98,,66-83,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.06.046,,#810,Govindan 2015,"",""
Deep learning for automated skeletal bone age assessment in X-ray images,"Spampinato, C.; Palazzo, S.; Giordano, D.; Aldinucci, M.; Leonardi, R.","Skeletal bone age assessment is a common clinical practice to investigate endocrinology, genetic and growth disorders in children. It is generally performed by radiological examination of the left hand by using either the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method or the Tanner–Whitehouse (TW) one. However, both clinical procedures show several limitations, from the examination effort of radiologists to (most importantly) significant intra- and inter-operator variability. To address these problems, several automated approaches (especially relying on the TW method) have been proposed; nevertheless, none of them has been proved able to generalize to different races, age ranges and genders. In this paper, we propose and test several deep learning approaches to assess skeletal bone age automatically; the results showed an average discrepancy between manual and automatic evaluation of about 0.8 years, which is state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, this is the first automated skeletal bone age assessment work tested on a public dataset and for all age ranges, races and genders, for which the source code is available, thus representing an exhaustive baseline for future research in the field. Beside the specific application scenario, this paper aims at providing answers to more general questions about deep learning on medical images: from the comparison between deep-learned features and manually-crafted ones, to the usage of deep-learning methods trained on general imagery for medical problems, to how to train a CNN with few images. © 2016",2017,,Medical Image Analysis,36,,41-51,,10.1016/j.media.2016.10.010,,#812,Spampinato 2017,"",""

This research aims to compare the seal peeling mechanisms evaluated by human participants and standard machine tests. The tests were conducted on flexible films used for typical packaging applications, including low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and nylon/LLDPE. Human peeling was simulated through the use of novel force measurement equipment. The results showed that the maximum machine peel force set by standard test methods was generally lower than the human peel force for most sealing temperatures. In all film types no significant difference was shown between genders, although for people over 65 years of age, peel force was generally lower than for the younger cohort. The results also indicated that peeling speed of human participants was normally higher than the peeling speed set according to the machine test standard.",2018,/,Journal of Testing and Evaluation,46,4,10 pp.,,10.1520/JTE20160541,,#813,Nilmanee 2018,"",""

Multi-site, multi-vendor cardiac MRI datasets comprising 95 patients (73 men, 22 women; mean age 62.73 ± 11.24 years) with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction, were randomly selected from data made available by the Cardiac Atlas Project (Fonseca et al., 2011). Three semi- and two fully-automated raters segmented the left ventricular myocardium from short-axis cardiac MR images as part of a challenge introduced at the STACOM 2011 MICCAI workshop (Suinesiaputra et al., 2012). Consensus myocardium images were generated based on the Expectation–Maximization principle implemented by the STAPLE algorithm (Warfield et al., 2004). The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values ranged between 0.63 and 0.85, 0.60 and 0.98, 0.56 and 0.94, and 0.83 and 0.92, respectively, against the STAPLE consensus. Spatial and temporal agreement varied in different amounts for each rater. STAPLE produced high quality consensus images if the region of interest was limited to the area of discrepancy between raters. To maintain the quality of the consensus, an objective measure based on the candidate automated rater performance distribution is proposed. The consensus segmentation based on a combination of manual and automated raters were more consistent than any particular rater, even those with manual input. The consensus is expected to improve with the addition of new automated contributions.

Examining the Concurrent Impact of Teaching and Assessment Format on Undergraduate Students' Academic Performance in Marketing,"Livas, Christos; Karali, Nansy","Purpose: By focusing on a Greek traditional learning university, during and post COVID-19 restrictions, the study aims at examining the concurrent effects of teaching and assessment format on students' academic performance. The inclusion of case studies in course assessment post COVID-19 restrictions is also expected to give a rough insight into students' employability skills and workplace readiness. Design/methodology/approach: The academic performance of 489 undergraduate students, as determined by the grades they earned, was measured in the final exams of business-to-business marketing and integrated marketing communication courses, held in January 2021 and 2022 at a Greek public university. The primary predictor variable or interest was ""teaching and assessment format"", and took two values: (1) online teaching with multiple-choice assessment format (during COVID-19 restrictions); and (2) traditional classroom teaching with in-person case study and open-ended assessment format (post COVID-19 restrictions). Findings: Grades were found to be affected by the participants' year of study, the type of marketing course, in which they were examined, and the teaching and assessment format employed. Either in whole or by gender, students appear to perform significantly worse in the traditional teaching with in-person case study and open-ended questions assessment format.

"An Investigation of Students' Preferences, Satisfaction and Performance in Online Assessment amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic in Türkiye","Arslan, Kürsat; Semenderoglu, Adnan; Uyanik, Ercan","This study aimed to discuss the online/e-assessment methods applied in the education faculties of state universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and to reveal student satisfaction and achievement in such methods. Accordingly, the relationships between student grades, the preferred method, and student satisfaction levels were examined by residential region and gender. The study was conducted on 371 university students from seven universities in different geographical regions of Turkey. A survey design, one of the quantitative research methods, was preferred in the study. The analysis results showed that the most preferred online assessment methods by the academics during the COVID-19 pandemic included homework (93%), timed online examinations (92%), and online presentation (76%). When students' attitudes towards those assessment methods were examined, we found that students' favorite online assessment method was homework (71%), and timed online examinations (46%) and online presentations (31%) were the least preferred methods. Besides, the students received the highest grades (76 and above) by doing online homework (72%), online presentations (69%), and projects (62%). They received the lowest scores in online examinations (50%). The findings revealed a positive and significant relationship between students' satisfaction with online assessment methods and their grades, but there was no significant difference between student satisfaction and gender variable. The university's region was also an influential factor in determining student satisfaction. In conclusion, both faculty members/academics and students predominantly preferred the homework method, and the students received the highest grades with this method. Although the most preferred assessment method in face-to-face and online education is testing, most academics did not prefer e-tests, mainly stemming from their lack of experience in administering online tests and managing the potential problems of online assessment methods.",2022,,Malaysian Online Journal of Educational Technology,10,4,294-305,2861190694; EJ1364912,,,#820,Arslan 2022,"",""
College Students' Perceived Teaching Presence in Emergency Remote Online Mathematics Teaching,"Taley, Isaac Bengre","In this period of the COVID-19 outbreak, the interest in replacing conventional face-to-face teaching with online teaching in Ghana's Colleges of Education has sown amidst concerns about the presence of teaching. Through an online survey, 452 students from three education colleges responded to the teaching presence scale. This study examined college students' perception of mathematics teaching presence and how gender and the mode of interaction affected students' sense of teaching presence during the emergency remote online teaching of mathematics. The results showed that about 82.7% of the students had a moderate to a high sense of mathematics teaching presence in the emergency remote online teaching. This means that mathematics teachers were unable to identify the mathematics learning needs, neither were teachers able to manage collaborative and reflective work, nor averted undirected discourse among 27.3% of the students. Although the gender of students did not affect the sense of mathematics teaching, the result indicated that in the absence of asynchronous mode of interaction, synchronous and blended modes of interaction positively affected students' perceived mathematics teaching presence. Altogether, this study urges mathematics teachers to employ creative pedagogical approaches that make teaching presence more conspicuous to students in emergency remote online mathematics teaching.",2022,,Journal of Research and Advances in Mathematics Education,7,3,116-129,2860855616; EJ1361523,,,#821,Taley 2022,"",""
The Impact of Teaching from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Student Evaluations of Female Academics,"Tangalakis, Kathy; Kelly, Kate; KonYu, Natalie; Hall, Dianne","Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) results play an important role in academic staff performance evaluation, but also in promotion processes. However, there is much evidence to suggest that the SET used in most universities across the Anglosphere has traditionally penalised female academics. As universities manage the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, they will also need to take into account the effect of remote teaching on the validity of student evaluation data. Given SET are critical to promotion success, it is important to then understand the gendered effect of remote teaching on student evaluations. We aimed to evaluate how intrusions of family life, academics' home environment and competence with remote teaching technology of female academics were viewed by students and if there were noticeable differences in SET data. We analysed 22,485 SET data over 2019 (pre-COVID, face-to-face teaching) and 2020 (COVID-lockdowns, remote teaching) for female and male academics, matched with student gender, in the multidisciplinary First Year College at Victoria University, Melbourne Australia. Our results showed that there were no differences in the score ratings for teacher gender. However, the qualitative data showed that whilst overall there were overwhelmingly positive comments for both male and female teachers, there was an increase in the negative comments on teaching style by male students toward their female teachers during remote teaching and overall more comments relating to attitude. We speculate that this would have a negative impact on the confidence of teaching-intensive female academics hindering their leadership aspirations and career progression in academia.",2022,,Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,19,1,160-173,2674265030; EJ1336073,,,#822,Tangalakis 2022,"",""

Furthermore, factors associated with students' future educational goals, home educational resources and confidence were found as the common determinators of science success in all participant countries. Another notable finding was all factors, except time spent on doing homework, tended to differentiate the success status between girls and boys of 22 countries.",2020,,Journal of Baltic Science Education,19,2,186-200,2488219099; EJ1271007,,,#830,Askin 2020,"",""
Student Evaluations of Teaching: Phrenology in the 21st Century?,"Rodriguez, Jason; Rodriguez, Naomi Glenn-Levin; Freeman, Kendralin","We argue that student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are a key tactic for justifying and maintaining white male dominance in US higher education. As such, tenure and promotion processes that rely on SETs as a measure of 'teaching quality' reproduce racial and gender inequality. We situate the contemporary use of SETs amidst a long history of technologies of power that deploy measurements to justify racial and gender inequality, including phrenology and the removal of children of color from their parents' custody. The technologies of power we explore each gain force through institutional contexts and the use of 'scientific' measurements, the production of data, and the use of statistics or numbers to 'measure' social differences. We argue that these technologies of power never simply measure existing differences but produce them and that each has a prior content that deploys a norm of white male privilege.",2020,,"Race, Ethnicity and Education",23,4,473-491,2459004963; EJ1254777,https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2018.1538118,,#831,Rodriguez 2020,"",""
"Identifying Exceptional Talent in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: Increasing Diversity and Assessing Creative Problem-Solving","Maker, C. June","In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving.

"Student Access of Online Feedback Is Modified by the Availability of Assessment Marks, Gender and Academic Performance","Mensink, Paul J.; King, Karen","We used educational data mining to quantify student access of online feedback files and explore the underlying drivers of feedback file access in a learning management system (LMS). We collated LMS access logs for 32 individual pieces of assessment representing 1462 feedback files for 484 students (males = 45%, females = 55%) that originated across three undergraduate years, from 20 different degree pathways. Over a third of assessment feedback files (38%, 553 files) were never accessed by students. When students could obtain their assessment mark without opening the associated feedback file, 42% of feedback files were not accessed by students (513 of 1224 files). When assessment marks were integrated into the feedback file (and not reported within the LMS), the proportion of unopened feedback dropped significantly to only 17% of files (40 of 238 files). We uncovered strong gender-specific differences in how students accessed feedback within the LMS that were dependent upon academic performance and the integration of marks within the feedback file. Poorly performing males were less likely to access feedback; however, integrating marks into the feedback files meant that males were over 27 times more likely to access the feedback file. In contrast, females exhibited a much weaker and more variable response to marks being reported within feedback files.

A New Assessment to Monitor Student Performance in Introductory Neurophysiology: Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device,"Cerchiara, Jack A.; Kim, Kerry J.; Meir, Eli; Wenderoth, Mary Pat; Doherty, Jennifer H.","The basis for understanding neurophysiology is understanding ion movement across cell membranes. Students in introductory courses recognize ion concentration gradients as a driving force for ion movement but struggle to simultaneously account for electrical charge gradients. We developed a 17-multiple-choice item assessment of students' understanding of electrochemical gradients and resistance in neurophysiology, the Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD). We investigated the internal evidence validity of the assessment by analyzing item characteristic curves of score probability and student ability for each question, and a Wright map of student scores and ability. We used linear mixed-effect regression to test student performance and ability. Our assessment discriminated students with average ability (weighted likelihood estimate: -2 to 1.5 [theta]); however, it was not as effective at discriminating students at the highest ability (weighted likelihood estimate: >2 [theta]). We determined the assessment could capture changes in both assessment scores (model r[superscript 2] = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability estimates (model r[superscript 2] = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444) after a simulation-based laboratory and course instruction for 222 students. Differential item function analysis determined that each item on the assessment performed equitably for all students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, or economic status. Overall, we found that men scored higher (r[superscript 2] = 0.51, P = 0.014, n = 444) and had higher ability scores (P = 0.003) on the EGAD assessment.

PACE is considered an ""innovative"" assessment and accountability system because performance assessments are used to help determine student proficiency in most federally required grades and subjects instead of the state achievement test. One key criterion for success in the early years of the PACE innovative assessment system is ""no harm"" on the statewide accountability test. This descriptive study examines the effect of PACE on Grades 8 and 11 mathematics and English language arts student achievement during the first three years of implementation (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 school years) and the extent to which those effects vary for certain student subgroups using results from the state's accountability tests (Smarter Balanced and SATs). Findings suggest that students in PACE schools tend to exhibit small positive effects on the Grades 8 and 11 state achievement tests in both subjects in comparison to students attending non-PACE comparison schools.

Aim: This study examined the influence of instructor personality (as reported by both students and instructors themselves) on student educational outcomes at university. Sample and method: Mathematics and psychology university students (N = 515) and their instructors (n = 45) reported their personality under the Big Five framework. Results: Multilevel regressions were conducted to predict each outcome from instructor personality, taking into account the effects of student gender, age, cognitive ability, and personality, as well as instructor gender and age. Student-reports of instructor personality predicted student evaluations of teaching but not performance self-efficacy or academic achievement. Instructor self-reports did not predict any of the outcomes. Stronger associations between student-reports and the outcomes than instructor self-reports could be explained by students providing information on both the predictor and the outcome variables, as well as a greater number of raters providing information on instructor personality.

Anatomy self-efficacy differed based on gender and prior performance. Student usage of the videos varied widely and students with lower self-efficacy were more inclined to use the resources. The provision of the videos did not improve overall cohort performance as compared to a historical cohort, however, those students that accessed all video sets experienced a greater normalized learning gain compared to students that used none or one of the four sets of videos. Student reports and usage patterns indicate that the videos were primarily used for practical class preparation and revision.

"Teaching Quality Evaluation: Online vs Manually, Facts and Myths","Esmael, Salman","Aim/Purpose: This study aimed to examine whether there is a difference between manual feedback and online feedback with regard to feedback quality, respondents' percentage, reliability and the amount of verbal comments written by students. Background: The quality of teaching is an important component of academic work. There are various methods for testing the quality of teaching; one of these methods is through students' feedback. Methodology: This study used a quantitative approach, including the quantification of qualitative verbal data collected through an open question in the questionnaire. A sample of 180 courses was randomly chosen, 90 courses were evaluated manually and 90 were evaluated online. The number of students ranges from 7 to 60 students per course. In total 4678 students participated in the study. Contribution: The findings show that there is almost an identical pattern of feedback of manual and online course teaching evaluation. These findings encourage a continued use of this evaluation method. Findings: No significant differences were found between manual feedback and online feedback in the students' evaluation of the lecturer/course. The percentage of respondents was significantly higher in the manual feedback than in the online feedback. The number of qualitative comments was significantly greater in the online feedback than in the manual feedback. Impact on Society: The findings of this study refute the claims with regard to the unreliability of an online teaching evaluation. These findings reflect the advantages of using online feedback, such as cost savings, granting more time to students in order to provide feedback, and reducing disturbance during lectures. Recommendations: It would be of great importance to explore if any differences would be found in evaluating students' feedback according to their learning disciplines.

This paper analyses the accuracy of undergraduate students, focusing primarily on the concept of self-assessment as they predict and evaluate their own performance relative to their externally assessed achievement. In the pre- and post-examination predictions the higher achieving students seem to predict and evaluate their examination results more accurately than their lower-achieving fellows. Although a gender gap cannot be found in self-estimation, we found substantial differences by comparing the selected language. Foreign students seem to overestimate their own examination performance to a greater degree than Hungarians do. Consequently, our results might allow decision makers to identify why self-assessment is important when implementing pilot ERP projects.

Introducing Computer-Based Concept Mapping to Older Adults,"Calvo, Iñaki; Elorriaga, Jon A.; Arruarte, Ana; Larrañaga, Mikel; Gutiérrez, Julián","The dramatic eruption of information and communication technology has had a remarkable effect on modern life, including the capacity to help older adults improve their quality of life and remain independent longer.

There is sound evidence that older adults can learn and acquire computer skills just like younger people do, although they might need more time to reach a similar level of mastery.

"A Study of the Relationship between Gender, Salary, and Student Ratings of Instruction at a Research University","Magel, Rhonda C.; Doetkott, Curt; Cao, Li","Salary studies in the United States and some other countries show a gap between male and female faculty salaries in higher education that widens over time. The present study examines one possible explanation, particularly at research universities, by examining changes in faculty salaries in relation to student ratings of instruction. Student ratings of instruction are often used to evaluate teaching effectiveness. The present study uses data on salaries and student ratings of instruction for every tenured and tenure-track faculty member teaching at least one class during the 2008-2009 academic year at one research university in the Midwest. A regression analysis was conducted regressing faculty salaries on a standardized version of a student rating of instruction variable while controlling for other variables such as market salary, rank, and whether or not the faculty member was in a STEM discipline. As student ratings of instruction increased for male faculty, their salary went up, whereas when student ratings of instruction increased for female faculty, their salary went down. Further information was gathered at the same Midwest university on a work-life survey.

Dissecting the Voice: Health Professions Students' Perceptions of Instructor Age and Gender in an Online Environment and the Impact on Evaluations for Faculty,"Doubleday, Alison F.; Lee, Lisa M. J.","Gender and age bias is well-documented in academia with many studies demonstrating bias in students' evaluations of instructors. Failure of an instructor to meet gender or age-based expectations can translate to lower scores or negative comments on evaluations. While there is some evidence of bias in students' evaluations of online instructors, current studies have not fully examined the relationship between bias and instructor vocal characteristics. First-year dental students at two institutions were randomly assigned one of four videos on spinal cord anatomy to view. Videos contained identical content but were narrated by individuals of different gender and age (younger man, younger woman, older man, older woman). Students completed a content-based prequiz, watched the video, completed a postquiz, and answered a questionnaire evaluating the video and instructor. Students at Institution A rated the younger man and younger woman highest for nearly every evaluation category. At Institution B students rated the older man and younger woman highest. Results reveal that the older woman's voice received the lowest rankings for nearly every question in both samples. This report confirms the presence of gender and age bias in student evaluations of instructors in an online environment and demonstrates that bias may surface in response to vocal characteristics. Bias may impact older women more significantly than other groups. Differences in results from Institution A and Institution B suggest that factors affecting student perceptions of instructors, and the roles that gender and age bias may play in student evaluations, are complex and may be contextual.",2016,,Anatomical Sciences Education,9,6,537-544,1969016671; EJ1118641,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1609,,#853,Doubleday 2016,"",""

In addition, gender and initial course selection differences were investigated. Raw pass rates under the three pedagogical approaches were compared; they were also compared, controlling for initial ability levels, using a logistic regression. Results showed that a more extensive duration of the introductory block produced a higher pass rate in students, but changing the programming tool used did not.

Using the Laboratory to Engage All Students in Science Practices,"Walker, J. P.; Sampson, V.; Southerland, S.; Enderle, P.

We use Ford's (2008) description of the nature of scientific practices to categorize what students do in the laboratory as either empirical or representational. One approach to lab instruction, engages students in the empirical practices of science but in a traditional prescriptive manner designed to demonstrate and verify content. The second approach, Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI), engages students in both the empirical and representational practices of science. A practical exam was used to compare student learning in each condition. The assessment targeted student ability to participate in specific scientific practices, including planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data and arguing from evidence. Students who were taught with either ADI (N = 81) or Traditional (N = 76) had equivalent understanding of content based on the ACS-GCST exam, however the mean score on the practical exam was significantly higher for students in the ADI sections. Results also indicate that the mean scores on the practical exam were significantly higher in the ADI sections for all students including female students, under-represented minority (URM) students, and students with lower past academic achievement. In the traditional laboratory sections there was a significant difference in the mean scores on the practical exam for the URM student relative to the majority, which was not present in the ADI sections.

Student Evaluations of Physics Teachers: On the Stability and Persistence of Gender Bias,"Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra","There is a long history of research which confounds the simple interpretation that evaluations in an educational context are purely measures of competency. One such issue is that of gender bias in student evaluations of their teachers. In our prior work, we found that male students underrated female high school teachers in biology and chemistry while all students underrated female high school teachers in physics. In the current work, we independently checked and extended this earlier work to examine the effect of physics identity on student evaluations and gender bias. Employing multiple regression on survey data from a representative sample of 6772 college students across the U.S., attending both 2-year and 4-year post-secondary institutions (including STEM and non-STEM majors), we find the core physics effect is unchanged despite a gap between studies of nearly 10 years. Namely, both male and female students underrate their female high school physics teachers, even after controlling for physics grades and classroom experiences. Our new focus on physics identity reveals that students with a strong physics identity show a larger gender bias in favor of male teachers than those with less of a physics identity. These results may help to explain how structures that privilege certain groups and marginalize others are prevalent amongst the youngest members of a defined physics community and may serve to uphold the status quo as these young members traverse to higher levels of physics community membership. Furthermore, biased evaluative feedback structures may be one of the propagators of women's lower competency beliefs in physics, a result that has been found by many prior studies.

Differences between Students with and without ADHD on Task Vigilance under Conditions of Distraction,"Ross, Peter; Randolph, Justus","Distraction is a typical component of any classroom environment. For effective instruction and learning to take place, it is critical for students to eventually return to task and maintain task vigilance (i.e., returning to the task at hand) when a distraction occurs. Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), by definition, are more distractible than students without ADHD. However, studies showing specific variability of task vigilance between students with and without ADHD are limited. This correlational study examined the differences in distractibility on task vigilance between students with and without ADHD under conditions of distraction. Two groups of participants, ranging in age from 7 to 11 years, were identified. The participants with existing diagnoses of ADHD were matched to participants without ADHD by gender, age, grade, race, school performance, and ability to help maintain group equivalence. The procedure called for all students to complete simple math computations and copying tasks while exposed to a distracting stimulus. Results showed a marked, statistically significant difference in task completion rates for both tasks between groups. Secondly, students with ADHD had considerable difficulties disengaging from the distracting stimulus and returning to task (i.e., maintaining task vigilance). These findings, rather than generic deficits, may account for a large portion of underachievement suffered by students with ADHD.

Whose Feedback?

While much research has examined the validity of SETs for measuring teaching quality, few studies have investigated the factors that influence student participation in the SET process. This study aimed to address this deficit through the analysis of an SET respondent pool at a large Canadian research-intensive university. The findings were largely consistent with available research (showing influence of student gender, age, specialisation area, and final grade on SET completion). However, the study also identified additional influential course-specific factors such as term of study, course year level, and course type as statistically significant. Collectively, such findings point to substantively significant patterns of bias in the characteristics of the respondent pool. Further research is needed to specify and quantify the impact (if any) on SET scores. We conclude, however, by recommending that such bias does not invalidate SET implementation, but instead should be embraced and reported within standard institutional practice, allowing better understanding of feedback received, and driving future efforts at recruiting student respondents.",2016,,Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education,41,6,821-839,1826541443; EJ1106153,https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2015.1044421,,#861,Macfadyen 2016,"",""

Results indicated that the modeled predictors showed extremely low bias towards both teaching quality scores and response rate. Although the effect sizes of these results are extremely small, they are still significant due to the large sample size (comprising over 2000). The findings also suggest that contrary to common parlance in some quarters claiming students' unreliable ratings, this analysis has shown that students can judge teaching effectiveness and do not allow other teacher-, course- and student-related factors to bias their responses.

This effect held independent of degree of campus engagement, sex, student status (domestic or international), and generational status (students who were the first in their families to attend university, compared to those who were not). Given that over the course of their studies, students likely would have been exposed to a range of different behaviours on the part of their professors, it is argued that the propensity of a large number of students to give consistently low evaluations was a form of ""habitual behaviour.""",2015,,Canadian Journal of Higher Education,45,4,298-321,1773214289; EJ1086951,,,#868,Grayson 2015,"",""

The Tail Wagging the Dog; An Overdue Examination of Student Teaching Evaluations,"Miles, Patti; House, Deanna","Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of several factors beyond the professor's control and their unique impact on Student Teaching Evaluations (STEs). The present research pulls together a substantial amount of data to statistically analyze several academic historical legends about just how vulnerable STEs are to the effects of: class size, course type, professor gender, and course grades. Design/methodology/approach: This research is utilizes over 30,000 individual student evaluations of 255 professors, spanning six semesters, during a three year time period to test six hypotheses. The final sample represents 1057 classes ranging in size between 10 and 190 students. Each hypothesis is statistically analyzed, with either analysis of variance or a Regression model. Findings: This study finds support for 5 out of 6 hypotheses. Specifically, these data suggest STEs are likely to be closest to ""5"" (using a 1-5 scale with 5 being highest) in small elective classes, and lowest in large required classes taught by females. As well we find support for the notion that higher expected course grades may lead to higher STEs. Practical implications: The practical significance of this research is important. First this research utilized a large data set spanning several years and hundreds of professors and thousands of students and rigorous statistical analysis to assert several important findings. Indeed STEs are impacted significantly by class type, class size, the gender of the professor and the expected course grade. With these findings we suggest a more comprehensive mechanism is in order for evaluation of teaching effectiveness. Social implications: This research could have great social implications if widely read across academic circles. Indeed the tail is wagging the dog; or the student is influencing teaching across America's universities. It is time to examine teaching effectiveness through a different lens, because using teaching evaluations to determine promotion and tenure, sparse bonus allocation, and teaching awards may be short sighted. Research limitations: While this research is statistically accurate, it is limited by the notion that the data was collected from one large area. As such, care should be taken in generalizing these results to other areas that may have different demographic composition, funding etc. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge this research is the first of its kind to statistically analyze such a large body of data and provide a useful guide to help evaluate professors utilizing what information is available.",2015,,International Journal of Higher Education,4,2,116-126,1697488026; EJ1060536,,,#871,Miles 2015,"",""

Factors Contributing to Problem-Solving Performance in First-Semester Organic Chemistry,"Lopez, Enrique J.; Shavelson, Richard J.; Nandagopal, Kiruthiga; Szu, Evan; Penn, John","Problem solving is a highly valued skill in chemistry. Courses within this discipline place a substantial emphasis on problem-solving performance and tend to weigh such performance heavily in assessments of learning. Researchers have dedicated considerable effort investigating individual factors that influence problem-solving performance. The purpose of this study is to inspect the influences of a core set of factors (prior science achievement, knowledge structures, spatial ability, gender, and ethnicity) and their overall contributions to problem solving in organic chemistry using multivariate regression analyses. Results indicate that knowledge structures are a key predictor of problem-solving performance and account for a significant proportion of the variation in students' problem-solving scores.

The Migrant Effect: An Evaluation of Native Academic Performance in Qatar,"Cheema, Jehanzeb R.","Recent data have suggested that despite massive outlays on educational reform Qatar consistently ranks as one of the least academically proficient countries in key areas of literacy. Of the seventy-four countries that participated in PISA 2009 Qatar ranked between sixty-seven and sixty-nine in mathematics, reading and science literacy. Although this is a very dismal level of performance when compared to other countries, for the native Qatari population even these low rankings are biased upward. This study shows that a major reason for overestimation of native academic performance in Qatar is the presence of a large foreign component in the student population. The bias persists even after controlling for demographic differences such as age, gender, grade and socioeconomic status.

The Effects of Gender on Group Work Process and Achievement: An Analysis through Self- and Peer-Assessment,"Takeda, Sachiko; Homberg, Fabian","The importance of teamwork skills as part of employability has been widely acknowledged and accompanied by active research on successful cooperative learning. However, relatively few studies have focused on the effects of gender on students' group work, and only a limited number of empirical studies exist that examine students' group work process and performance through the results of self- and peer-assessment. This study examines the effects of gender on group work process and performance using the self- and peer-assessment results of 1001 students in British higher education formed into 192 groups. The analysis aggregates all measures on the group level in order to examine the overall group performance. Further, a simple regression model is used to capture the effects of group gender compositions. Results suggest that students in gender balanced groups display enhanced collaboration in group work processes. The enhanced collaboration could be associated with less social loafing behaviours and more equitable contributions to the group work. However, the results imply that this cooperative learning environment does not lead to higher student performance. Students' comments allow us to explore possible reasons for this finding. The results also indicate underperformance by all-male groups and reduced collaborative behaviours by solo males in male gender exception groups (i.e., groups consisting of one male student and other members being female). The results thus have implications for the composition of groups. The pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed.",2014,,British Educational Research Journal,40,2,373-396,1651848427; EJ1023136,https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3088,,#877,Takeda 2014,"",""
Motivating and Supporting Young People to Study Mathematics: A London Perspective,"Mujtaba, Tamjid; Reiss, Mujtaba; Hodgson, Ann","This paper explores which classroom and teacher factors are associated with post-16 mathematics aspirations, mathematics intrinsic motivation, and mathematics self-concept. Few studies explore all three outcomes among the same set of students or make linkages across the factors that are important to these outcomes. The analysis is based on the survey responses of 761 Year 8 (age 13) and 715 Year 10 (age 15) students from 17 London schools as learners of mathematics. The analysis indicates that teaching for engagement is important for intrinsic mathematics motivation but not for future mathematics aspirations. In addition, students' emotional responses to mathematics lessons are important for their mathematics self-concept but not for future mathematics aspirations. Advice-pressure to continue with mathematics post-16, extrinsic material gain motivation, and mathematics self-concept underpin mathematics aspirations (even after controlling for the support students received from their families in mathematics attainment). The gender difference within mathematics self-concept among these young Londoners was higher than that found across England, although there were substantially fewer gender differences in relation to questions that explored students' perceptions of their mathematics lessons and teachers. The article concludes with some suggestions for both national and London policymakers because the study of mathematics is seen as of considerable importance to both young people and the economic life of the capital.",2014,,London Review of Education,12,1,121-142,2009558725; EJ1160362,,,#878,Mujtaba 2014,"",""
Attributional Gender Bias: Teachers' Ability and Effort Explanations for Students' Math Performance,"Espinoza, Penelope; Arêas da Luz Fontes, Ana B.; Arms-Chavez, Clarissa J.","Research is presented on the attributional gender bias: the tendency to generate different attributions (explanations) for female versus male students' performance in math. Whereas boys' successes in math are attributed to ability, girls' successes are attributed to effort; conversely, boys' failures in math are attributed to a lack of effort and girls' failures to a lack of ability. This bias has been shown in previous research to be committed by teachers, parents, and students themselves. The present work sought to investigate whether this bias among secondary school math teachers might be reduced over time through adoption of an incremental theory of intelligence. Findings revealed at baseline, teachers committed the expected bias in reference to their high-achieving students' math performance. Following exposure to stimuli, teachers in both experimental and control conditions reduced this bias. Unexpectedly, teachers across conditions showed a type of compensation for the bias by reversing stereotypical attributions for girls' and boys' successes and failures in math. Further, participants relapsed to the original bias nearly a year later.

First-Year Students' Priorities and Choices in STEM Studies--IRIS Findings from Germany and Austria,"Elster, D.","IRIS (Interests and Recruitment in Science; http://iris.fp-7.org/about-iris/) is a European 7th framework project focusing on the challenge that only few young people in general, and women in particular, choose an education and career in science and technology. Project IRIS aims to contribute to the improvement of recruitment, retention and gender equity patterns in higher education. To acquire information about the factors that influence the educational choice of young people, a questionnaire was developed by the IRIS consortium. The IRIS questionnaire is based on the model of achievement-related choices (Eccles, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1999) and on the theory on the role of self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1997). These theories provide a framework for investigating the central aspects that influence an individual's educational choice. This paper reports the experience and findings of the IRIS survey conducted in Austria and Germany. The data are based on a questionnaire survey with 3680 first-year students. Additionally, interview data from Austrian biology students contribute qualitative data about supportive and hindering factors that influences the study choice.

Pearson and partial correlations simultaneously controlling for six demographic variables, Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness showed that SETs were positively related to Agreeableness and CSE and negatively related to Neuroticism, supporting the three hypotheses of study. Each of these significant relations was maintained when MPI, LPI or a composite of MPI and LPI served as the SET criterion. For example, the MPI-LPI composite correlated 0.28 with Agreeableness, 0.35 with CSE and -0.28 with Neuroticism. Similar correlations resulted for MPI and LPI. Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated that the CSE was an independent predictor of MPI ratings, Agreeableness was an independent predictor of LPI ratings, and both the CSE and Agreeableness were independent predictors of MPI-LPI composite ratings.

A retrospective hospital-based medical record review was conducted to identify maternal deaths among women aged 15 to 49 years with all death causes. Out of 447 mortality records identified from the hospital wards, 89 maternal mortality cases were identified by the study review compared to 83 cases in the HMIS report. The HMIS report showed an underreporting rate of 6.7% (6/89) and a misclassification rate of 13.5% (12/89) within five years. These findings highlight the need for establishing mechanisms for the verification and monitoring of maternal mortality data reporting in health facilities. Improving the quality of maternal death reporting could help inform evidence-based interventions and policies that address the root causes of maternal mortality, and achieve SDGs in Malawi.

The impact of living with transfeminine vocal gender dysphoria: Health utility outcomes assessment,"Nuyen, Brian; Cherian Kandathil; McDonald, Daniella; Thomas, James; Most, Sam P","Background: The voice signals a tremendous amount of gender cues. Transfeminine individuals report debilitating quality-of-life deficits as a result of their vocal gender dysphoria.Aims: We aimed to quantify the potential impact of this dysphoria experienced with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as associated treatments, through validated health utility measures.Methods: Peri-operative phonometric audio recordings of a consented transfeminine patient volunteer with a history of vocal gender dysphoria aided in the description of two transfeminine health states, pre- and post-vocal feminization gender dysphoria; monocular and binocular blindness were health state controls. Survey responses from general population adults rate these four health states via visual analogue scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time tradeoff (TTO).Results: Survey respondents totaled 206 with a mean age of 35.8 years. Through VAS measures, these general adult respondents on average perceived a year of life with transfeminine vocal gender dysphoria as approximately three-quarters of a life-year of perfect health. Respondents also on average would have risked a 15%–20% chance of death on SG analysis and would have sacrificed 10 years of their remaining life on TTO measures to cure the condition. The QALY scores for the post-gender affirming treatments for vocal gender dysphoria (+0.09 VAS, p < 0.01) were significantly higher compared to the pretreatment state. There were no differences in the severity of these QALY scores by survey respondent’s political affiliation or gender identity.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify how the general population perceives the health burden of vocal gender dysphoria experienced by transfeminine patients.

Assessment of Place of Delivery and Associated Factors among Pastoralists in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Evaluation,"Lebeza Alemu Tenaw; Kumsa, Henok; Arage, Mulugeta Wodaje; Atitegeb Abera; Hailu, Tilahun; Mislu, Esuyawkal","Background. Pastoralist communities rely on their livestock for at least 50% of their food supply and source of income. Home births raise the risk of maternal morbidity and death, whereas institutional births lessen the likelihood of difficulties during labor. Around 70% of labors in pastoralist regions of Ethiopia were assisted by traditional birth attendants. Methods. Studies done from January 2004 to January 2023, accessed in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and other search engines, were included. PRISMA guidelines and JBI critical appraisal checklist were used to assure the quality of the review. Ten articles were included in this review. Data were extracted with Excel and exported to STATA 16 for analysis. Heterogeneity of literatures was evaluated using I2 statistics and publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and the Duval and Tweedie trim-fill analysis. Statistical significance was declared at p value less than 0.05. Result. The pooled estimate of institutional delivery among the pastoralist community in Ethiopia is 21.2% (95% CI: 16.2-26.1). Husbands who were involved to decide place of delivery (OR=3.47; 95% CI: 1.61, 7.50), women with good knowledge of MCH services (OR=2.283; 95% CI: 1.51, 3.44), women who had a positive attitude towards MCH services (OR=1.69; 95% CI: 0.79, 3.6), availability of health institutions (OR=2.6; 95% CI: 0.95, 7.20), and women who had an ANC follow-up (OR=2.78; 95% CI: 2.07, 3.73) were higher institutional delivery prevalence among pastoralist women. Moreover, institutional delivery among women who were educated above the college level was more than two times (OR=2.56; 95% CI: 1.985, 3.304) higher than among women who were not educated. Conclusion. Pastoralist women in Ethiopia were found to be a disadvantaged group for institutional delivery at national level.

The Myth of “Reliable Research” in Pediatric Gender Medicine: A critical evaluation of the Dutch Studies—and research that has followed,"Abbruzzese, E; Levine, Stephen B; Mason, Julia W","Two Dutch studies formed the foundation and the best available evidence for the practice of youth medical gender transition. We demonstrate that this work is methodologically flawed and should have never been used in medical settings as justification to scale this “innovative clinical practice.” Three methodological biases undermine the research: (1) subject selection assured that only the most successful cases were included in the results; (2) the finding that “resolution of gender dysphoria” was due to the reversal of the questionnaire employed; (3) concomitant psychotherapy made it impossible to separate the effects of this intervention from those of hormones and surgery. We discuss the significant risk of harm that the Dutch research exposed, as well as the lack of applicability of the Dutch protocol to the currently escalating incidence of adolescent-onset, non-binary, psychiatrically challenged youth, who are preponderantly natal females. ""Spin"" problems—the tendency to present weak or negative results as certain and positive—continue to plague reports that originate from clinics that are actively administering hormonal and surgical interventions to youth.

Prospective paired crossover evaluation of potential impact of investigator gender on perceived pain intensity early after acute or scheduled surgery,"Anna Sellgren Engskov; Ydrefors, Andreas; el-Jaleb, Karolin; Åkeson, Jonas","BackgroundPostoperative pain is common but often difficult to assess, and there are many potential confounders. Over the last decades, the gender of investigator as well as participant has been found to influence pain perception in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, to our knowledge this has not been studied in various postoperative patients. Objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that pain intensity levels early after acute or scheduled in- or out-hospital surgery are lower when evaluated by a female investigator, and higher when reported by a female patient.MethodsIn this prospective observational paired crossover study, two investigators of opposite genders independently obtained individually reported pain intensity levels with a visual analogue scale in a mixed cohort of adult postoperative study patients at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden.ResultsIn total, 245 (129 female) study patients were included and then one female excluded. The study patients rated their intensity of postoperative pain lower when evaluated by a female than by a male investigator (P = 0.006), where the male patients constituted the significant difference (P < 0.001). Pain intensity levels did not differ between female and male study patients (P = 0.210).ConclusionsMain findings of lower pain intensity reported by males to a female than to a male investigator early after surgery in this paired crossover study in mixed postoperative patients, indicate that potential impact of investigator gender on pain perception should be considered and further evaluated in clinical bedside practice.Trial registration Retrospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov research database on 24th June 2019 with TRN number NCT03968497.",2023,,Biology of Sex Differences,14,,1-9,2815632217,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-023-00508-9,,#899,AnnaSellgrenEngskov 2023,"",""
Need assessment for the content of educational programs about breast cancer from the viewpoint of unaffected women,"Alipour, Sadaf; Orouji, Marzieh; Eskandari, Yas; Eskandari, Amirhossein","BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common cancer among females, and early diagnosis is possible in case the patients seek medical attention on time. For this to come true, they must know about the existence and risks of the disease and be aware of the appropriate attitude and actions toward prevention or early diagnosis. However, we see that women have unanswered questions about these issues. In this study, we sought to investigate healthy women’s information needs about breast cancer from their own perspective.MethodsThis prospective study was carried out by using the maximum variation sampling, and theoretical saturation to reach sample saturation. Women who came to different clinics of Arash Women’s Hospital (except the Breast Clinic) during two months were entered in the study. Participants were asked to write down all the questions and subjects they would like to be explained in a breast cancer educational program. The questions were reviewed and categorized after every fifteen consecutive forms were filled until there was not even one new question. Afterwards, all the questions were reviewed and matched based on their similarity and repeated items were eliminated. Finally, questions were organized according to their common topics and the range of details they comprised.ResultsSixty patients were included in the study, and 194 questions were gathered and categorized according to common scientific terms, resulting in 63 questions in 5 categories.ConclusionsMany studies have been conducted on breast cancer education, but none have addressed healthy women's personal queries.

A Qualitative assessment of adolescent-parent sex talk in Ghana,"Agbeve, Anthony S; Fiaveh, Daniel Y; Anto-Ocrah, Martina","Young people’s views on sexuality in sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood. We know little about what they think of their sexual upbringing and how it influences their sexual and reproductive health decisions and behaviors. Guided by feminism and an intersectionality framework, the current study uses narratives from purposefully sampled adolescents and parents from rural households within Adaklu District, one of the eighteen districts in the Volta Region of Ghana, to examine parents’ and young people’s perceptions of young adolescents’ acquisition of sexuality knowledge, their sexual encounters and experiences, and the overall dynamics in educating young adolescents aged 16-19 years about sex. Specifically, we explored the types of sexuality issues parents discussed with their wards at home, and where appropriate, analyzed the inherent gender disparities in these discussions. Generally, parents agree that young people should know about sex. However, they emphasized that sexuality education should be age-specific and should be guided by cultural values and religious faith. Adolescents’ exposure to multiple sources, including parental upbringing, the media, and information from peers, determines the extent they either engage or not engage in sexual activities. Parent-adolescent conversations were structured along gender lines, emphasizing adolescent girls' needs due to their perceived vulnerability compared to boys. While some of the findings support earlier views in terms of a very conservative, morally scripted way of training young people, it also suggests that young people’s sexual upbringing is not as repressive as previous studies would make it appear. Young people keep pushing the boundaries as they develop agencies to learn about sex from multiple sources. Therefore, policies seeking to promote young people’s sexual and reproductive rights in Ghana should pay close attention to what young people know about sex and how they know what they know, recognizing that their knowledge-seeking is part of human development and not inherently “bad”.

Nous savons peu de choses sur ce qu'ils pensent de leur éducation sexuelle et comment celle-ci influence leurs décisions et leurs comportements en matière de santé sexuelle et reproductive.

Plus précisément, nous avons exploré les types de problèmes de sexualité dont les parents discutaient avec leurs pupilles à la maison et, le cas échéant, analysé les disparités inhérentes entre les sexes dans ces discussions. Généralement, les parents s'accordent à dire que les jeunes devraient être au courant de la sexualité. Cependant, ils ont souligné que l'éducation sexuelle devrait être spécifique à l'âge et guidée par les valeurs culturelles et la foi religieuse. L'exposition des adolescents à de multiples sources, y compris l'éducation parentale, les médias et les informations de leurs pairs, détermine dans quelle mesure ils s'engagent ou non dans des activités sexuelles. Les conversations parents-adolescents étaient structurées selon le genre, mettant l'accent sur les besoins des adolescentes en raison de leur vulnérabilité perçue par rapport aux garçons. Bien que certaines des découvertes corroborent les opinions antérieures en termes de manière très conservatrice et moralement scénarisée de former les jeunes, elles suggèrent également que l'éducation sexuelle des jeunes n'est pas aussi répressive que les études précédentes le laissent croire. Les jeunes continuent de repousser les limites en développant des agences pour se renseigner sur le sexe à partir de multiples sources.

Evaluation of the Transfer of Training for a Sexual Assault Resistance Program Enhanced with Sexuality Education,"Jeffrey, Nicole K.; Senn, Charlene Y.; Hobden, Karen L.; Barata, Paula C.; McVey, Gail L.; Radtke, H. Lorraine; Eliasziw, Misha","IntroductionThe Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) Sexual Assault (SA) Resistance Program is a theoretically sound, evidence-based program providing SA resistance education within a positive sexuality framework. It was shown to substantially reduce sexual assault victimization among university women who participate (Senn et al. in New England Journal of Medicine 372(24), 2326-2335, 2015). Staff training can either enhance or impede successful program scale-up and implementation. In this paper, we evaluate the transfer of training to implementation sites (i.e., postsecondary institutions) using a train-the-trainer model.MethodsUsing pre- and post-training surveys and post-training interviews conducted from 2016 to 2020 with 33 implementation staff members from multiple sites, we answered the following research questions:1. Did the training meet its overall goal of preparing implementation staff?2. What training components were perceived to contribute to training effectiveness and implementation staff preparedness?ResultsResults suggested that our model of training was effective. Competence, confidence, and knowledge and ability increased significantly after training, and most staff perceived the training to be highly useful and effective (especially for preparing them to address EAAA participant issues). Practice and feedback from trainers through active learning techniques were especially important. Although implementation staff reported being well prepared to deliver the training or program, they reported being less prepared for handling other implementation-related activities and issues (that the training was not necessarily designed to address in-depth).ConclusionsOur findings suggest a need to enhance existing training on self-care and supporting program facilitators and for ongoing support and reminders from program purveyors to ensure that implementers are making use of existing resources.

Therefore, understanding stress during pregnancy provides insight into racial disparities in maternal health, particularly Black maternal health.  Objectives:  This study aimed to describe (1) daily exposure to self-reported stress levels during pregnancy, and (2) sources of stress among participants that identified as Black or White using data collected via ecological momentary assessment.  Methods:  We leveraged survey data from the Postpartum Mothers Mobile Study, a prospective longitudinal study using ecological momentary assessment data collection methods to describe patterns of stress during pregnancy.

Most participants (53%) reported no change in their sexual interest during the pandemic, followed by those who reported an increase (28.5%). The pattern was similar across the eight countries. Distress about discrepant sexual interest, which was only weakly related to changes in sexual interest, was significantly associated with relationship quality and emotional closeness with a partner, coping with and worrying about the pandemic, and specific motivation for sex. In contrast to avoidant and relationship-focused approach motivation, ego-focused approach motivation was related to stable sexual interest during the pandemic.

In addition to traditional segmentation along race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, many GBM also identify with sexual subcultural communities. Previous research has shown differences across a variety of health outcomes between these sexual subcultural communities. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HIV prevention practices among GBM differed according to sexual subcultural community. The study was conducted in collaboration with a popular social and sexual networking smartphone application company. A total of 23,577 GBM responded to the survey. A latent class analysis identified 6 distinct classes related to sexual subcultural community identification. We found significant differences across sociodemographic characteristics, HIV prevention practices, and condomless anal sex in the past 6 months related to sexual subculture identification. Findings suggest that sexual subcultural identity is related to decision-making around HIV prevention among GBM. Differences in HIV prevention strategies are likely a function of group norms, unique shared experiences among GBM identifying with a particular sexual subculture community, and sociodemographic characteristics associated with these groups. As such, sexual subculture identity should be considered in developing interventions and social marketing campaigns to increase uptake of biomedical HIV prevention tools among GBM.

The program objectives were to (a) increase knowledge and risk awareness of targeted conditions, (b) change health-care-seeking attitudes toward regular primary care among AA men, and (c) improve their lifestyle-related health behaviors by leveraging the influence of women in their lives. The community-engaged educational intervention targeted both men and women and included eight 90-min sessions per cohort. Topics included prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, health-care access, and healthy lifestyle. Sessions were both didactic and interactive. A pre-/post-intervention questionnaire assessed knowledge. Interviews were conducted with male participants and a focus group discussion (FGD) with women to assess program impact. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed for themes and recommendations. Major themes were—increased knowledge/awareness of risk associated with chronic conditions, change in health-care-seeking attitudes, increased self-efficacy to engage the health-care system, and lifestyle changes. Other impacts reported were building community/social support, a safe and enabling learning environment, and enhanced community health status overall. Recommendations included having extended, more in-depth sessions, targeting the younger generation, smaller cohort sizes, and more community-based health programming.

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments.

"Evaluation of Knowledge and Practice of Pharmacy Professionals regarding the Risk of Medication Use during Pregnancy in Dessie Town, Northeast Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study","Tuha, Abdu; Gurbie, Yilak; Hailu, Haftom Gebregergs","Background. The developing organism is unique in its responsiveness to drugs and predictability of therapeutic effectiveness based on the adult which can lead to grave consequences in the neonate and child. Moreover, uncertainty about the risks of drug use in pregnancy could result in restrictive attitudes towards prescribing and dispensing medicines and their use. Pharmacists have huge duties to improve medication use, especially among pregnant women. The objective of this study is, hence, to assess the knowledge and practice of pharmacy professionals (PPs) towards the risk of medication use during pregnancy. Methodology. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out over practicing community and hospital pharmacy professionals in Dessie town. They were asked about the safety of common drugs during pregnancy. It involves both prescription-only medications (POM) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Secondly, they were asked about their practice towards the risk of medication use during pregnancy. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were utilized. For descriptive analysis, results were expressed as numbers, percentages, and mean (± SD and 95% CI). Result. Seventy-six pharmacy professionals in Dessie, Northeast Ethiopia, took part in the study. Most of the respondents (64.5%) believed that amoxicillin is safe in all trimesters. 26 (34.2%) of participants knew that isotretinoin is unsafe for use by pregnant women. About dietary supplements, 32.9% of PPs reported that Vitamin A supplements are safe in all trimesters. There was a significant difference observed for study college and years of experience of the PPs in their score of knowledge test (p=0.020 and p=0.024, respectively). Additionally, there was a difference seen for gender (p=0.030), study college (p=0.036), and working institution (p=0.013) in their advice to pregnant women. Conclusion and Recommendation. Overall, PPs exhibited very low knowledge about drug safety during pregnancy. The absence of obligatory continuing pharmacy education for pharmacists is expected to have negatively affected the level of medication knowledge and consequently the pharmaceutical care services delivered in community and hospital pharmacies. As medication knowledge of PPs is poor, a multitude of strategies (educational, economic, managerial, and regulatory) should be designed by the government, universities, and pharmaceutical associations to improve the pharmacy professionals’ role in the healthcare system by providing them with continuous and up-to-date medication knowledge.",2019,,Journal of Pregnancy,2019,,8,2268265231,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2186841,,#923,Tuha 2019,"",""

The revised Stress Measurement of Female Marriage Immigrants in Korea: Evaluation of the psychometric properties,"Park, Min Hee, PhD, MPH, RN; Yang, Sook Ja, PhD, MPH, RN; Chee, Yeon Kyung, PhD","The twenty-one item Stress Measurement of Female Marriage Immigrants (SMFMI) was developed to assess stress of female marriage immigrants in Korea. This study reports the psychometric properties of a revised SMFMI (SMFMI-R) for application with female marriage immigrants to Korea who were raising children. Participants were 190 female marriage immigrants from China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Asian countries, who were recruited using convenience sampling between November 2013 and December 2013. Survey questionnaires were translated into study participants' native languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, and English). Principal component analysis yielded nineteen items in four factors (family, parenting, cultural, and economic stress), explaining 63.5% of the variance, which was slightly better than the original scale. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated adequate fit for the four-factor model. Based on classic test theory and item response theory, strong support was provided for item discrimination, item difficulty, and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.923). SMFMI-R scores were negatively associated with Korean proficiency and subjective economic status. The SMFMI-R is a valid, reliable, and comprehensive measure of stress for female marriage immigrants and can provide useful information to develop intervention programs for those who may be at risk for emotional stress.",2016,,Women & Health,56,4,395-412,1781818185,https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2015.1101747,,#930,Park 2016,"",""
Evaluation of sex- and gender-based medicine training in post-graduate medical education: a cross-sectional survey study,"Kling, Juliana M; Rose, Steven H; Kransdorf, Lisa N; Viggiano, Thomas R; Miller, Virginia M","BackgroundAddressing healthcare disparities is a national priority for initiatives in precision and individualized medicine. An essential component of precision medicine is the understanding that sex and gender influence health and disease. Whether these issues are addressed in post-graduate medical education curricula is unknown.MethodsA questionnaire was designed and administered to residents across the Mayo Clinic enterprise to assess current knowledge of sex and gender medicine in a large program of post-graduate medical education and to identify barriers and preferred teaching methods for addressing sex and gender issues in health and disease. Descriptive and qualitative thematic analyses of the survey responses were compiled and analyzed.ResultsResponses were collected from 271 residents (response rate 17.2 %; 54 % female; 46 % male). A broad cross-section of training programs on all Mayo Clinic campuses (Arizona, Minnesota, and Florida) was represented. Sixteen percent of the respondents reported they had never had an instructor or preceptor discuss how a patient's sex or gender impacted their care of a patient; 55 % said this happened only occasionally. Of medical knowledge questions about established sex- and gender-related differences, 48 % were answered incorrectly or ""unsure."" Qualitative thematic analysis showed that many trainees do not understand the potential impact of sex and gender on their clinical practice and/or believe it does not pertain to their specialty. A higher percentage of female participants agreed it was important to consider a patient's sex and gender when providing patient care (60.4 vs. 38.7 %, p =  0.02), and more male than female participants had participated in research that included sex and/or gender as a variable (59.6 vs. 39.0 %, p < 0.01).ConclusionsCurriculum gaps exist in post-graduate medical training regarding sex- and gender-based medicine, and residents often do not fully understand how these concepts impact their patients' care. Reviewing the definition of sex- and gender-based medicine and integrating these concepts into existing curricula can help close these knowledge gaps. As the practice of medicine becomes more individualized, it is essential to equip physicians with an understanding of how a patient's sex and gender impacts their health to provide the highest value care.",2016,,Biology of Sex Differences,7,,,1835850286,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-016-0097-3,,#931,Kling 2016,"",""
"The Stereotype Threat Hypothesis: An Assessment from the Philosopher's Armchair, for the Philosopher's Classroom","Schouten, Gina","According to Stereotype Threat Hypothesis (STH), fear of confirming gendered stereotypes causes women to experience anxiety in circumstances wherein their performance might potentially confirm those stereotypes, such as high-stakes testing scenarios in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses. This anxiety causes women to underperform, which in turn causes them to withdraw from math-intensive disciplines. STH is thought by many to account for the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, and a growing body of evidence substantiates this hypothesis. In considering the plausibility of STH as an explanation for women's disproportionate attrition from undergraduate philosophy programs, one is struck by dissimilarities between STEM and philosophy that appear to undermine the applicability of STH to the latter. In this paper, I argue that these dissimilarities are either merely apparent or merely apparently relevant to the plausibility of STH as an explanation for gender disparities in philosophy. I argue further that, if research from STEM uncovers promising strategies for confronting stereotype threat, we should think about how to apply those strategies in our introductory philosophy classrooms.",2015,,Hypatia,30,2,450,1678885163,https://doi.org/10.1111/hypa.12148,,#932,Schouten 2015,"",""
Consenting to Sexual Activity: The Development and Psychometric Assessment of Dual Measures of Consent,"Jozkowski, Kristen N; Sanders, Stephanie; Peterson, Zoë D; Dennis, Barbara; Reece, Michael","Sexual assault prevention efforts have focused on educating students to obtain consent as a mechanism to reduce sexual assault, yet little is known about how college students consent to sex. Additionally, there are currently no measures available to assess students' consent to sex. The current study aimed to better understand college students consent by using a systematic approach to develop validated measures of sexual consent. This study integrated mixed methods via three phases and two waves of data collection to develop two measures of consent. In Phase 1, qualitative data were collected from college students (n = 185) to inform the design of quantitative measures aimed at assessing sexual consent at last sexual intercourse. In Phase 2, items were written for the closed-ended quantitative instrument and reviewed by a team of experts, educators, and clinicians. In Phase 3, a quantitative survey was administered to college students (n = 660) which included the measures of consent developed from the Phase 1 data; the measures were assessed for their psychometric properties. Exploratory factor analyses were utilized to assess the measures and resulted in five factors each for both consent scales. Both scales had high internal consistency reliability, showed gender differences, and showed differences across relationship status (single vs. in a relationship). The two newly developed measures assess unique constructs of consent and demonstrate assessments of specific concepts. Our findings provide an important contribution to the field of sexuality as these measures can be used in future research to better understand sexual consent.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2014,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,43,3,437-50,1504088776; 24452630,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-013-0225-7,,#933,Jozkowski 2014,"",""

This world fails to accommodate adequately the needs and experiences of women: no more evident than in the transport sector, where a ‘default male’ perspective dominates the planning and policies that shape our roads, railways, airlines, and shipping. This paper argues that the ways in which masculinity infuses transport systems mean they are integral to debates on gender and work. They impact both the way women experience travel and their access to places of work. A multi-transport domain scoping study has been conducted to review the literature for key gender factors that influence the use of road, rail, aviation, and maritime transport modes. A multi-disciplinary approach is proposed which incorporates perspectives and methods from the social sciences that can help to foster Gender-Equitable Human Factors (GE-HF).

Aims: This study sought to combine machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique to identify key features of academic resilience in mathematics learning during COVID‐19. Materials and Methods: Based on PISA 2022 data in 79 countries/economies, the random forest model coupled with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value technique not only uncovered the key features of academic resilience but also examined the contributions of each key feature. Results: Findings indicated that 35 features were identified in the classification of academically resilient and non‐academically resilient students, which largely validated the previous academic resilient framework. Notably, gender differences were shown in the distribution of some key features. Research findings also indicated that resilient students tended to have a stable emotional state, high levels of self‐efficacy, low levels of truancy and positive future aspirations.

Can mixed assessment methods make biology classes more equitable?,"Cotner, Sehoya; Ballen, Cissy J.","Many factors have been proposed to explain the attrition of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields, among them the lower performance of women in introductory courses resulting from deficits in incoming preparation. We focus on the impact of mixed methods of assessment, which minimizes the impact of high-stakes exams and rewards other methods of assessment such as group participation, low-stakes quizzes and assignments, and in-class activities. We hypothesized that these mixed methods would benefit individuals who otherwise underperform on high-stakes tests. Here, we analyze gender-based performance trends in nine large (N > 1000 students) introductory biology courses in fall 2016. Females underperformed on exams compared to their male counterparts, a difference that does not exist with other methods of assessment that compose course grade. Further, we analyzed three case studies of courses that transitioned their grading schemes to either de-emphasize or emphasize exams as a proportion of total course grade. We demonstrate that the shift away from an exam emphasis consequently benefits female students, thereby closing gaps in overall performance. Further, the exam performance gap itself is reduced when the exams contribute less to overall course grade. We discuss testable predictions that follow from our hypothesis, and advocate for the use of mixed methods of assessments (possibly as part of an overall shift to active learning techniques). We conclude by challenging the student deficit model, and suggest a course deficit model as explanatory of these performance gaps, whereby the microclimate of the classroom can either raise or lower barriers to success for underrepresented groups in STEM.

Our results showed that when stereotype threat was primed in high school students (n = 244), there was no relationship between their performance on an academic test (the SweSAT) and their assessment of their performance (how well they did), whereas in a non-stereotype threat condition, there was a medium-sized relationship. The effect was similar for both men and women primed with stereotype threat. The results imply that stereotype threat undermines performance assessments.

Cross-validation of the Work Organization Assessment Questionnaire across genders: A study in the Australian health care sector,"Karimi, Leila; Karanika-Murray, Maria; Meyer, Denny","Objectives: The main aim of this study was to examine the measurement invariance of the Work Organization Assessment Questionnaire (WOAQ) across genders in a group of health care employees, using bifactor modeling. There is a very limited research that uses invariance testing of bifactor models, despite their usefulness. Establishing validity of the WOAQ in this way is important for demonstrating its relevance for both men and women. Methods: A bifactor modeling procedure was used here to examine the validity of the WOAQ with a sample of 946 paramedics employed in a large Australian organization in the health care sector. Results: The results of this study show that the WOAQ has good psychometric properties across genders in health care settings. In addition, there were significant mean differences between men and women in their perceptions of 'quality of relationships with colleagues,' and 'reward and recognition.' There were no differences between men and women in the remaining factors: 'quality of relationships with the management,' 'quality of relationships with colleagues,' and 'quality of the physical environment.' Conclusions: The use of bifactor modeling to establish the cross-validity of the WOAQ across male and female paramedics adds to evidence for the measure’s good psychometric properties. The findings confirm those of previous research that has used higher order confirmatory factor analysis. Moreover, mean differences between men and women were found to be significant in two of the five WOAQ subscales.

Differences in words used to describe racial and gender groups in Medical Student Performance Evaluations,"Ross, David A.; Boatright, Dowin; Nunez-Smith, Marcella; Jordan, Ayana; Chekroud, Adam; Moore, Edward Z.","Purpose: The transition from medical school to residency is a critical step in the careers of physicians. Because of the standardized application process—where in schools submit summative Medical Student Performance Evaluations (MSPE's)—it also represents a unique opportunity to assess the possible prevalence of racial and gender disparities, as shown elsewhere in medicine. Method: The authors conducted textual analysis of MSPE's from 6,000 US students applying to 16 residency programs at a single institution in 2014-15. They used custom software to extract demographic data and keyword frequency from each MSPE. The main outcome measure was the proportion of applicants described using 24 pre-determined words from four thematic categories ('standout traits', 'ability' 'grindstone habits', and 'compassion'). Results: The data showed significant differences based on race and gender. White applicants were more likely to be described using 'standout' or 'ability' keywords (including 'exceptional', 'best', and 'outstanding') while Black applicants were more likely to be described as 'competent'. These differences remained significant after controlling for United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores. Female applicants were more frequently described as 'caring', 'compassionate', and 'empathic' or 'empathetic'. Women were also more frequently described as 'bright' and 'organized'. Conclusions: While the MSPE is intended to reflect an objective, summative assessment of students' qualifications, these data demonstrate for the first time systematic differences in how candidates are described based on racial/ethnic and gender group membership. Recognizing possible implicit biases and their potential impact is important for faculty who strive to create a more egalitarian medical community.

Do preservice teachers’ judgments and judgment accuracy depend on students’ characteristics? The effect of gender and immigration background,"Bonefeld, Meike; Dickhäuser, Oliver; Karst, Karina","It is important for teachers to be able to accurately assess students’ performance. Such judgments can be influenced by characteristics of the student Südkamp et al. (J Educ Psychol 104:743–762, 2012. 10.1037/a0027627). Besides students’ actual performance, students’ group characteristics (e.g., gender or immigration background) may effect teachers’ judgments. In addition, judgment accuracy might be different for various student groups. We conducted an online study of 168 preservice teachers. We presented within a virtual classroom mathematics test results of 12 fictitious second-grade students who differed in their actual performance in a mathematical test, immigration background, and gender. Preservice teachers made a judgment about the students’ current performance. Students’ actual performance, immigration background, and gender showed statistically significant main effects on the judgment. Students with (vs. without) an immigration background and female (vs. male) students were evaluated less favorably. These effects were qualified by a statistically significant three-way interaction between actual performance, immigration background, and gender. The joint examination of student characteristics in terms of judgment accuracy shows that it is precisely the interaction of student characteristics that makes a difference: female students with and without an immigration background as well as students without an immigration background are assessed more accurately, while male students with an immigration background are assessed significantly more inaccurately. In sum, the judgment made by preservice teachers about students’ performance differed in terms of student characteristics that were unrelated to performance such as immigration background and gender in addition to differing on performance-related variables.

Gender and socioeconomic related differences in performance based ICT competences,"Aesaert, Koen; van Braak, Johan","In the past, several studies have investigated the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status on the one hand, and students' ICT competences on the other.

Gender inequality at home is associated with poorer health for women,"Eek, Frida; Axmon, Anna","Background: As more women have joined the work force, the difference in employment rate between men and women has decreased, in Sweden as well as many other countries. Despite this, traditional gender patterns regarding, for example, responsibility for household duties still remain. Women are on sick leave more often than men, and previous studies have indicated that an unequal split of household responsibilities and perceived gender inequality could be associated with negative health outcomes. Aims: The aim of the present study was to explore whether an unequal distribution of responsibilities in the home was related to various health related outcomes among women. Methods: A sample consisting of 837 women living in a relationship, and working at least 50% of full time, responded to a questionnaire including information about division of responsibilities at home as well as various psychological and physiological health related outcomes. Results: The results showed that women living in relationships with perceived more unequal distribution of responsibility for house hold duties showed significantly higher levels of perceived stress, fatigue, physical/psychosomatic symptoms, and work family conflict compared with women living in more equal relationships. They also had significantly increased odds for insufficient time for various forms of recovery, which may further contribute to an increased risk of poor health. Conclusions: Although an increasing employment rate among women is valuable for both society and individuals, it is important to work towards greater gender equality at home to maintain this development without it having a negative effect on women’s health and well-being.

Method: Participants with a first episode of psychosis (74 women/86 men) and healthy controls (62 women/97 men) were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: Women in the clinical group were older at illness onset and had achieved higher formal education than men. This trend was the same for the control group. The patient group presented with lower premorbid IQ compared to healthy controls, and performed below for most neuropsychological tests. Women scored higher than men on a test of verbal memory, whereas men scored higher than women on a test of reaction time, visual memory, and a planning task. There were no group-by-sex interactions for any of the neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The present study shows that at the onset of psychosis there are no differences between males and females in neuropsychological performance. The differential pattern of cognitive performance observed is similar to that in healthy males and females. Furthermore, females with a late onset of psychosis may represent a subgroup with specific visuospatial and problem solving impairments. Significant outcomes: 1- The present study does not give support to the hypothesis that male have worse neurocognitive functioning than female patients at illness onset. 2- The neuropsychological profile of sex differences observed among patients is consistent with that observed among controls. 3- We identified a subgroup of female patients with late onset that differed in their degree and pattern of cognitive impairment with regard to their male counterparts. Limitations: 1- Factors other than neurocognitive functioning may underlie the more severe impairment observed in the onset and course of illness in men. 2- Although the study used a broad battery of well established tests, this battery may lack sensitivity to detect sex differences. 3- A longitudinal study is required to further explore whether sex specific deficits require special rehabilitation programs for patients with schizophrenia.

In this study, we determined prevalence of both concerning and dangerous behaviors on 12 tests and subtests of a canine behavioral evaluation by analyzing data collected by the behavioral staff at a NY shelter (n = 1,104 dogs tested between 2014 and 2019). We also examined whether behavior on four tests and subtests with prevalence over 10% (two Sociability subtests, Handling test, and Dog-to-dog meeting subtest) was associated with likelihood of being returned to the shelter post-adoption, and whether dog demographic characteristics (age, sex, reproductive status, and body size) were associated with behaviors on tests and subtests. Of all dogs tested, prevalence measures of dangerous behaviors were always less than 5%. Our measures of prevalence (concerning and dangerous behaviors combined) for food guarding (15.5%), stranger-directed aggression (6.5%), and dog-directed aggression (16.7%) were generally similar to those reported for dogs in other shelters and in homes. For the four tests/subtests examined here, displaying concerning or dangerous behavior was not significantly associated with return to the shelter, and positive predictive values (PPV) were low, which implies that many positive tests will be false positives. We also found few significant associations between demographic characteristics and behavior on tests and subtests and PPV were low. Other factors, such as previous experiences with people and dogs, as well as underlying physiological and neurobiological processes, may be more important influences on a dog’s behavior during a shelter behavioral evaluation than general demographic characteristics. Total number of tests and subtests out of a possible 12 on which dogs were assessed as showing concerning or dangerous behaviors ranged from zero to 7 per dog (median, 0; mean, 0.82). In summary, poor predictive abilities characterized associations between performance on certain tests/subtests of the behavioral evaluation and return to the shelter and between demographic characteristics and behavior on test/subtests. Our data may contribute to the ongoing debate about the usefulness of canine behavioral evaluations in shelters.

We examined 407 middle school students’ scientific inquiry self-efficacy and computer game self-efficacy before and after completing a computer game-like assessment about a science mystery.

By contrast, computer game self-efficacy was neither predictive of nor predicted by performance on the science assessment. While boys had higher computer game self-efficacy compared to girls, multi-group analyses suggested only minor gender differences in how efficacy beliefs related to performance.

Sex differences in the subjective effects of oral Δ⁹-THC in cannabis users,"Fogel, Jessica S.; Kelly, Thomas H.; Westgate, Philip M.; Lile, Joshua A.","Previous studies suggest that there are sex differences in endocannabinoid function and the response to exogenous cannabinoids, though data from clinical studies comparing acute cannabinoid effects in men and women under controlled laboratory conditions are limited. To further explore these potential differences, data from 30 cannabis users (N = 18 M, 12 F) who completed previous Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC) discrimination studies were combined for this retrospective analysis. In each study, subjects learned to discriminate between oral Δ⁹-THC and placebo and then received a range of Δ⁹-THC doses (0, 5, 15 and a 'high' dose of either 25 or 30 mg). Responses on a drug-discrimination task, subjective effects questionnaire, psychomotor performance tasks, and physiological measures were assessed. Δ⁹-THC dose-dependently increased drug-appropriate responding, ratings on 'positive' Visual Analog Scale (VAS) items (e.g., good effects, like drug, take again), and items related to intoxication (e.g., high, stoned). Δ⁹-THC also dose-dependently impaired performance on psychomotor tasks and elevated heart rate. Sex differences on VAS items emerged as a function of dose. Women exhibited significantly greater subjective responses to oral drug administration than men at the 5 mg Δ⁹-THC dose, whereas men were more sensitive to the subjective effects of the 15 mg dose of Δ⁹-THC than women. These results demonstrate dose-dependent separation in the subjective response to oral Δ⁹-THC administration by sex, which might contribute to the differential development of problematic cannabis use.

Objectives: To determine the effects of work-related concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (wr-mTBI) on perceptions of refreshing sleep in workers with an injury and to identify the relevant factors responsible for sleep changes. Methods: We studied post-concussive changes in sleep in 66 adults (50% male workers, 42% aged 30–50 years, median post-injury days: 155) who had sustained wr-mTBI and experienced functional limitations long after the injury. We collected sociodemographic, occupational and health status data and identified variables related to post-concussive changes in refreshing sleep. Results: Forty-seven workers with wr-mTBI (79% of male workers, 64% of female workers) perceived their sleep as being refreshing before injury and unrefreshing afterwards (χ2 = 67.70 for change, χ2 = 27.6 for female and χ2 = 41.1 for male workers, p < 0.0001). Post-concussive losses in refreshing sleep were associated with socio demographic, occupational, and health status data variables. Sex stratification revealed differences between male and female workers.

Taking the time: The implications of workplace assessment for organizational gender inequality,"Nelson, Laura K.; Brewer, Alexandra; Mueller, Anna S.; O'Connor, Daniel M.; Dayal, Arjun; Arora, Vineet M.","Gendered differences in workload distribution, in particular who spends time on low-promotability workplace tasks—tasks that are essential for organizations yet do not typically lead to promotions—contribute to persistent gender inequalities in workplaces. We examined how gender is implicated in the content, quality, and consequences of one low-promotability workplace task: assessment. By analyzing real-world behavioral data that include 33,456 in-the-moment numerical and textual evaluations of 359 resident physicians (subordinates) by 285 attending physicians (superordinates) in eight U.S. hospitals, and by combining qualitative methods and machine learning, we found that, compared to men, women attendings wrote more words in their comments to residents, used more job-related terms, and were more likely to provide helpful feedback, particularly when residents were struggling. Additionally, we found women residents were less likely to receive substantive evaluations, regardless of attending gender. Our findings suggest that workplace assessment is gendered in three ways: women (superordinates) spend more time on this low-promotability task, they are more cognitively engaged with assessment, and women (subordinates) are less likely to fully benefit from quality assessment. We conclude that workplaces would benefit from addressing pervasive inequalities hidden within workplace assessment, equalizing not only who provides this assessment work, but who does it well and equitably.

The validity of three new driving simulator scenarios: Detecting differences in driving performance by difficulty and driver gender and age,"Maxwell, Hillary; Weaver, Bruce; Gagnon, Sylvain; Marshall, Shawn; Bédard, Michel","Objective: We explored the convergent and discriminant validity of three driving simulation scenarios by comparing behaviors across gender and age groups, considering what we know about on-road driving. Background: Driving simulators offer a number of benefits, yet their use in real-world driver assessment is rare. More evidence is needed to support their use. Method: A total of 104 participants completed a series of increasingly difficult driving simulation scenarios. Linear mixed models were estimated to determine if behaviors changed with increasing difficulty and whether outcomes varied by age and gender, thereby demonstrating convergent and discriminant validity, respectively. Results: Drivers adapted velocity, steering, acceleration, and gap acceptance according to difficulty, and the degree of adaptation differed by gender and age for some outcomes. For example, in a construction zone scenario, drivers reduced their mean velocities as congestion increased; males drove an average of 2.30 km/hr faster than females, and older participants drove more slowly than young (5.26 km/hr) and middle-aged drivers (6.59 km/hr). There was also an interaction between age and difficulty; older drivers did not reduce their velocities with increased difficulty. Conclusion: This study provides further support for the ability of driving simulators to elicit behaviors similar to those seen in on-road driving and to differentiate between groups, suggesting that simulators could serve a supportive role in fitness-to-drive evaluations. Application: Simulators have the potential to support driver assessment. However, this depends on the development of valid scenarios to benchmark safe driving behavior, and thereby identify deviations from safe driving behavior. The information gained through simulation may supplement other forms of assessment and possibly eliminate the need for on-road testing in some situations.

Evaluators are more likely to base their decisions on individual performance in joint than in separate evaluation and on group stereotypes in separate than in joint evaluation, making joint evaluation the profit-maximizing evaluation procedure. Our work is inspired by findings in behavioral decision research suggesting that people make more reasoned choices when examining options jointly rather than separately and is compatible with a behavioral model of information processing.

With this study, we draw on role expectations theory to understand how inequality in assessment emerges as individuals transition from student to professional roles. To do this, we leverage the case of medical residency so that we can examine how changes in role expectations shape assessment while holding occupation and organization constant. By analyzing a dataset of 2,765 performance evaluations from a three-year emergency medicine training program, we empirically demonstrate that women and men are reviewed as equally capable at the beginning of residency, when the student role dominates; however, in year three, when the colleague role dominates, men are perceived as outperforming women. Furthermore, when we hold resident performance somewhat constant by comparing feedback to medical errors of similar severity, we find that in the third year of residency, but not the first, women receive more harsh criticism and less supportive feedback than men. Ultimately, this study suggests that role expectations, and the implicit biases they can trigger, matter significantly to the production of gender inequality, even when holding organization, occupation, and resident performance constant.

Wage formation and gender wage gaps: is there a role for job-task evaluation schemes?,"Asplund, R; Lilja, R","Purpose - Both academia and policymakers express a strong belief in higher average education levels exerting a narrowing impact on wage inequality in general and gender wage gaps in particular. The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize whether or not this effect extends to R&D- and export-intensive branches such as the technology industry.Design/methodology/approach - In exploring the impact of individual and job-related background factors and, especially, of job-task evaluation schemes on the size and change in gender wage gaps in the technology industry, the paper applies an elaborated decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression techniques.Findings - While changes in standard human capital endowments can explain little, if anything, of the growth in real wages or the widening of wage dispersion among the Finnish technology industry's white-collar workers, a new job-task evaluation scheme introduced in 2002 seems to have succeeded, at least in part, to make the wage-setting process more transparent by re-allocating especially the technology industry's female white-collar workers in a way that better reflects their skills, efforts and responsibilities.Practical implications - One crucial implication of this finding is that improving the standard human capital of women closer to that of men will not suffice to narrow the gender wage gap in the advanced parts of the economy and, hence, not also the overall gender wage gap. The reason is obvious: concomitant with rising average education levels, other skill aspects have received increasing attention in working life. Consequently, a conscious combination of formal and informal competencies as laid down in well-designed job-task evaluation schemes may, in many instances, offer a more powerful path for tackling the gender wage gap.Originality/value - While the existing evidence on the impact of performance-related pay on gender wage gaps is still scarce but growing the authors know of no empirical studies analyzing the gender pay-gap effect of job-task evaluation systems.",2014,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER,35,3,267-290,WOS:000341870100004,10.1108/IJM-04-2014-0091,,#957,Asplund 2014,"",""

Considerable evidence suggests that the gender imbalance observed at the top tiers of academic medicine is, in part, due to gender differences in promotional rates, with women being promoted more slowly than their male colleagues. The well-documented gender gaps in publications, grant support, recognition awards, speaker invitations, and leadership positions contribute to the slow progression of women in medicine, as promotions committees rely heavily upon these traditional measures of academic success to select candidates for career advancement. Additionally, implicit biases, which have been shown to favor men over women in science and leadership, influence decision-making processes relevant to the promotion of women in academia.

Many factors influence the promotion and tenure process including research, evaluations, opportunities for leadership, sponsorship, and mentorship. The goal of this study is to determine if resident evaluations of EM faculty differ by faculty gender. Methods: A quantitative analysis was used to examine 14,613 teaching evaluations of faculty by residents at a single academic center (The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus) in the years 20172019. Anonymized ratings of male and female faculty on a five -point Likert scale were compared using Fischer's exact test and adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: Male faculty were more likely to hold the rank of Associate Professor or Professor. When taking both faculty gender and rank into account, male Clinical Instructors and Assistant Professors had significantly higher evaluation scores by residents in the domain of resident autonomy than their female counterparts. Regardless of gender or faculty rank, the majority of faculty received scores greater than four. Conclusion: A significant gender difference was found in resident evaluation scores of faculty in the domain of resident autonomy at the level of Clinical Instructor and Assistant Professor. Resident autonomy refers to the degree of supervision by faculty which evolves over time and is primarily based on level of training.

A Quantitative Linguistic Analysis of National Institutes of Health R01 Application Critiques From Investigators at One Institution,"Kaatz, A; Magua, W; Zimmerman, DR; Carnes, M","PurposeCareer advancement in academic medicine often hinges on the ability to garner research funds. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) R01 award is the ""gold standard"" of an independent research program. Studies show inconsistencies in R01 reviewers' scoring and in award outcomes for certain applicant groups. Consistent with the NIH recommendation to examine potential bias in R01 peer review, the authors performed a text analysis of R01 reviewers' critiques.MethodThe authors collected 454 critiques (262 from 91 unfunded and 192 from 67 funded applications) from 67 of 76 (88%) R01 investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with initially unfunded applications subsequently funded between December 2007 and May 2009. To analyze critiques, the authors developed positive and negative grant application evaluation word categories and selected five existing categories relevant to grant review. They analyzed results with linear mixed-effects models for differences due to applicant and application characteristics.ResultsCritiques of funded applications contained more positive descriptors and superlatives and fewer negative evaluation words than critiques of unfunded applications. Experienced investigators' critiques contained more references to competence. Critiques showed differences due to applicant sex despite similar application scores or funding outcomes: more praise for applications from female investigators, greater reference to competence/ability for funded applications from female experienced investigators, and more negative evaluation words for applications from male investigators (all P < .05).ConclusionsResults suggest that text analysis is a promising tool for assessing consistency in R01 reviewers' judgments, and gender stereotypes may operate in R01 review.",2015,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,90,1,69-75,WOS:000347076300020,10.1097/ACM.0000000000000442,,#965,Kaatz 2015,"",""
Gender Disparities in Electronic Health Record Usage and Inbasket Burden for Internal Medicine Residents,"Liddell, SS; Tomasi, AG; Halvorsen, AJ; Stelling, BEV; Leasure, EL","BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated patients hold different expectations for female physicians compared to male physicians, including higher expectations for patient-centered communication and addressing socioeconomic or emotional needs. Recent evidence indicates this gender disparity extends to the electronic health record (EHR). Similar studies have not been conducted with resident physicians. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to characterize differences in EHR workload for female resident physicians compared to male resident physicians. DESIGN: This study evaluated 12 months of 156 Mayo Clinic internal medicine residents' inbasket data from July 2020 to June 2021 using Epic's Signal and Physician Efficiency Profile (PEP) data. Excel, BlueSky Statistics, and SAS analytical software were used for analysis. Paired t-tests and analysis of variance were used to compare PEP data by gender and postgraduate year (PGY). ""Male"" and ""female"" were used in substitute for ""gender"" as is precedent in the literature. SUBJECTS: Mayo Clinic internal medicine residents. MAIN MEASURES: Total time spent in EHR per day; time in inbasket and notes per day; time in notes per appointment; number of patient advice requests made through the portal; message turnaround time. KEY RESULTS: Female residents received more patient advice requests per year (p = 0.004) with an average of 86.7 compared to 68, resulting in 34% more patient advice requests per day worked (p < 0.001). Female residents spent more time in inbasket per day (p = 0.002), in notes per day (p < 0.001), and in notes per appointment (p = 0.001). Resident panel comparisons revealed equivocal sizes with significantly more female patients on female (n = 55) vs male (n = 34) resident panels (p < 0.001). There was no difference in message turnaround time, total messages, or number of results received. CONCLUSIONS: Female resident physicians experience significantly more patient-initiated messages and EHR workload despite equivalent number of results and panel size.

This study attempted to answer these questions, with the intention of adding to the relative paucity of literature on Asian and science students. A total of 284 Malaysian science pre-university students reading two academic courses in common (Chemistry and Mathematics) were surveyed on variables of SAL and its correlates - Intrinsic Motivation and perceptions of course experience ('CE': Intrinsic Motivation, Workload Inappropriateness, Clear Goals and Standards, Assessment for Understanding, Teaching for Conceptual Change). MANOVA revealed significant course differences on SAL but neither significant gender differences nor course-gender interactions. Mathematics had higher Deep and lower Surface approaches mean scores than Chemistry. These course differences were accompanied by significant and large course differences in variables associated with SAL: Mathematics had higher mean scores than Chemistry on Intrinsic Motivation and all CE variables that correlated significantly and positively with the Deep approach, but lower scores for Workload Inappropriateness which correlated positively with the Surface approach. Taken together, when respondents were identical for both courses, courses but not gender differed on SAL scores.

A blinded, multi-analyst approach was employed to identify themes across comments. Patterns in themes with resident gender and post-graduate year (PGY) were explored, focusing on PGY2 and PGY3 when residents are serving in the team leader role.ResultsData included 3,383 evaluations with narrative comments of 385 men (55.2%) and 313 women residents (44.8%). There were thematic differences in narrative comments received by men and women residents and how these themes manifested within comments changed with training time. Compared to men, comments about women had a persistent relationship-orientation and emphasized confidence over training including as interns and in PGY2 and PGY3, when serving as team leader. The relationship-orientation was characterized not only by the residents' communal attributes but also their interpersonal and communication skills, including efforts supporting others and establishing the tone for the team.

However, less work has focused on intersectional disparities by ethnoracial identity and sex in resident performance assessments.Objective To estimate intersectional sex-specific ethnoracial disparities in standardized EM resident assessments.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestones (Milestones) assessments to evaluate ratings for EM residents at 128 EM training programs in the US. Statistical analyses were conducted in June 2020 to January 2023.Exposure Training and assessment environments in EM residency programs across comparison groups defined by ethnoracial identity (Asian, White, or groups underrepresented in medicine [URM], ie, African American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic/Latine, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander) and sex (female/male).Main Outcomes and Measures Mean Milestone scores (scale, 0-9) across 6 core competency domains: interpersonal and communications skills, medical knowledge, patient care, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and system-based practice. Overall assessment scores were calculated as the mean of the 6 competency scores.Results The study sample comprised 128 ACGME-accredited programs and 16 634 assessments for 2708 EM residents of which 1913 (70.6%) were in 3-year and 795 (29.4%) in 4-year programs. Most of the residents were White (n = 2012; 74.3%), followed by Asian (n = 477; 17.6%), Hispanic or Latine (n = 213; 7.9%), African American or Black (n = 160; 5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (n = 24; 0.9%), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (n = 4; 0.1%). Approximately 14.3% (n = 386) and 34.6% (n = 936) were of URM groups and female, respectively. Compared with White male residents, URM female residents in 3-year programs were rated increasingly lower in the medical knowledge (URM female score, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.17), patient care (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01), and practice-based learning and improvement (-0.37; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.09) domains by postgraduate year 3 year-end assessment; URM female residents in 4-year programs were also rated lower in all 6 competencies over the assessment period.Conclusions and Relevance This retrospective cohort study found that URM female residents were consistently rated lower than White male residents on Milestone assessments, findings that may reflect intersectional discrimination in physician competency evaluation.

The tasks considered are divided into smaller activities, which allows us to discover hidden patterns. Tasks are not only restricted to the academic world, but also relate to domestic chores. We address this problem from a totally new perspective by using machine learning techniques, such as cluster analysis. In order to make important decisions, policymakers must know how academic staff spend their time, especially now that legal modifications are planned for the Spanish university environment.

The aim of this study was to analyse the predictive validity of the activity ability assessment in relation to future sick leave.Design: Analysis of assessments in 300 case files, in relation to register data on sick leave.Subjects: People on sick leave (n =300, 32% men, 68% women; mean age 48 years; assessment at mean sick leave day 249). Methods: Univariate and multivariate statistics.Results: Self-rated work ability was the only factor with predictive value related to future sick leave. Physicians' evaluations lacked predictive value, except where the person had a limitation in vision, hearing or speech that was predictive of future decisions by the Social Insurance Agency. No sex differences were identified.Conclusion: The predictive value of the activity ability assessment for future sick leave is limited, and selfrated work ability is more accurate compared with an extensive insurance medical assessment.

"Cognitive Effort during Visuospatial Problem Solving in Physical Real World, on Computer Screen, and in Virtual Reality","Soares, RD Jr; Ramirez-Chavez, KL; Tufanoglu, A; Barreto, C; Sato, JR; Ayaz, H","Spatial cognition plays a crucial role in academic achievement, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) domains. Immersive virtual environments (VRs) have the growing potential to reduce cognitive load and improve spatial reasoning. However, traditional methods struggle to assess the mental effort required for visuospatial processes due to the difficulty in verbalizing actions and other limitations in self-reported evaluations. In this neuroergonomics study, we aimed to capture the neural activity associated with cognitive workload during visuospatial tasks and evaluate the impact of the visualization medium on visuospatial task performance. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable neuroimaging to assess cognitive effort during spatial-reasoning-based problem-solving and compared a VR, a computer screen, and a physical real-world task presentation. Our results reveal a higher neural efficiency in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during 3D geometry puzzles in VR settings compared to the settings in the physical world and on the computer screen. VR appears to reduce the visuospatial task load by facilitating spatial visualization and providing visual cues. This makes it a valuable tool for spatial cognition training, especially for beginners. Additionally, our multimodal approach allows for progressively increasing task complexity, maintaining a challenge throughout training. This study underscores the potential of VR in developing spatial skills and highlights the value of comparing brain data and human interaction across different training settings.",2024,,SENSORS,24,3,,WOS:001160016500001,10.3390/s24030977,,#973,Soares 2024,"",""
Investigating the Determinants of Starting Salary of IT Graduates,"Ge, CM; Kankanhalli, A; Huang, KW","The starting salary of a fresh graduate is considered a potential indicator of career advancement. Yet few studies have examined the determinants of starting salaries of information technology (IT) graduates. Further, existing studies have focused on how demographics affect either the salary or the kind of job the graduate enters into, but rarely both. In this paper, we explore both and examine if entry into an IT job mediates the effects of demographics on the starting salaries of fresh IT graduates. Our model is tested using data from annual surveys of undergraduate students majoring in IT at a large public university in Singapore over a 5-year period. We find that gender and foreigner status influence both starting salary and fresh graduates' entry into an IT vs. non IT job. Further, the effect of gender on the starting salaries of IT graduates is partially mediated by their entry into an IT job. In other words, part of the reason for a gender difference in starting salary could be attributed to female IT majors being less likely to enter IT jobs upon graduation than their male counterparts. On the other hand, foreign IT graduates are more likely to enter IT jobs, yet their starting salaries are found to be lower than local graduates.

Gender Characteristics on Gaze Movement in Situation Awareness,"Lee, Y; Jung, K; Lee, H","In large systems, such as nuclear power plants, the operator's situation awareness is vital to the system's safety. Since gaze movement is closely related to situation awareness, various studies have evaluated it through gaze movement. The number of female workers is increasing even in large systems, such as nuclear power plants, so it is relevant to compare and analyze the situation awareness and gaze movement characteristics of men and women. In this study, an experiment was conducted to compare and analyze men's and women's situation awareness and gaze movement characteristics by making a simulator for emergency scenarios in nuclear power plants. Gaze entropy was used as a measure to indicate gaze movement, while the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART) was utilized to measure situation awareness. A total of 20 engineering college students (10 male, 10 female) participated in the experiment. Loss of coolant accident (LOCA), steam generator tube rupture (SGTR), steam line break (SLB), and loss of voltage (LOV) were the nuclear power plant accident situations used as task scenarios for the experiment. For all accident scenarios, the SART score did not show a significant difference between men and women. Shannon entropy, dwell time entropy, and heat map entropy did not show a significant difference between men and women, but Markov entropy was found to be significantly higher in women. In conclusion, there was no significant difference between men and women in awareness of accident situations.

Through the framework of embodied cognition, the NASA Task Load Index was used to measure cognitive demand. Practicing middle- and high-school science teachers were recruited to participate in this study. Participants operated drones at three instances over two weeks.

For both prior experience and gender, the differences were observed at the first instance of drone operation and not at subsequent trials. Results suggest prior experience and gender may only affect cognitive load at the initial experience and leveling of cognitive load occurs with continued practice. These findings can support an educator's planning for drone-based activities and help to mitigate the stigma of gender differences regarding technology use.

Factors that affect scientific publication in Africa-A gender perspective,"Beaudry, C; Prozesky, H; St-Pierre, C; Mirnezami, SR","A large body of literature on gender differences in scientific publication output has clearly established that women scientists publish less that men do. Yet, no single explanation or group of explanations satisfactorily accounts for this difference, which has been called the ""productivity puzzle"". To provide a more refined portrait of the scientific publication output of women in relation to that of their male peers, we conducted a web-based survey in 2016 of individual researchers across all African countries, except Libya. The resulting 6,875 valid questionnaires submitted by respondents in the STEM, Health Science and SSH fields were analyzed using multivariate regressions on the self-reported number of articles published in the preceding 3 years. Controlling for a variety of variables including career stage, workload, mobility, research field, and collaboration, we measured the direct and moderating effect of gender on scientific production of African researchers. Our results show that, while women's scientific publication output is positively affected by collaboration and age (impediments to women's scientific output decrease later in their careers), it is negatively impacted by care-work and household chores, limited mobility, and teaching hours. Women are as prolific when they devote the same hours to other academic tasks and raise the same amount of research funding as their male colleagues. Our results lead us to argue that the standard academic career model, relying on continuous publications and regular promotions, assumes a masculine life cycle that reinforces the general perception that women with discontinuous careers are less productive than their male colleagues, and systematically disadvantages women.

Correlation of online assessment parameters with summative exam performance in undergraduate medical education of pharmacology: a prospective cohort study,"Kühbeck, F; Berberat, PO; Engelhardt, S; Sarikas, A","Background Learning analytics aims to improve learning outcomes through the systematic measurement and analysis of learning-related data. However, which parameters have the highest predictive power for academic performance remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of different online assessment parameters with summative exam performance in undergraduate medical education of pharmacology. Methods A prospective study was conducted with a cohort of undergraduate medical students enrolled in a pharmacology course at Technical University of Munich, Germany. After a four-week teaching and learning period, students were given access to an online assessment platform consisting of 440 multiple choice (MC) questions. After 12 days, a final written summative exam was performed. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed for different online assessment parameters as predictors and summative exam performance as dependent variable. Self-perceived pharmacology competence was measured by questionnaires pre- and postintervention. Results A total of 224 out of 393 (57%) students participated in the study and were included in the analysis. There was no significant correlation for the parameters ""number of logins"" (r = 0.01, p = 0.893), ""number of MC-questions answered"" (r = 0.02, p = 0.813) and ""time spent on the assessment platform"" (r = - 0.05, p = 0.459) with exam performance. The variable ""time per question"" was statistically significant (p = 0.006), but correlated negatively (r = - 0.18) with academic performance of study participants. Only ""total score"" (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and the ""score of first attempt"" (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with final grades. In a multiple regression analysis, ""score first attempt"" accounted for 52% of the variation of ""score final exam"", and ""time per question"" and ""total score"" for additional 5 and 1.4%, respectively. No gender-specific differences were observed. Finally, online assessments resulted in improved self-perceived pharmacology competence of students. Conclusion In this prospective cohort study, we systematically assessed the correlation of different online assessments parameters with exam performance and their gender-neutrality.

Gender Disparity in Evaluation of Internal Medicine Clerkship Performance,"Gorth, DJ; Magee, RG; Rosenberg, SE; Mingioni, N","IMPORTANCE Women studying medicine currently equal men in number, but evidence suggests that men and women might not be evaluated equally throughout their education.OBJECTIVE To examine whether there are differences associated with gender in either objective or subjective evaluations of medical students in an internal medicine clerkship.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated data from 277 third-year medical students completing internal medicine clerkships in the 2017 to 2018 academic year at an academic hospital and its affiliates in Pennsylvania. Data were analyzed from September to November 2020.EXPOSURE Gender, presumed based on pronouns used in evaluations.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Likert scale evaluations of clinical skills, standardized examination scores, and written evaluations were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to observe trends in measures. Word embeddings were analyzed for narrative evaluations.RESULTS Analyses of 277 third-year medical students completing an internal medicine clerkship (140 women [51%] with a mean [SD] age of 25.5 [2.3] years and 137 [49%] presumed men with a mean [SD] age of 25.9 [2.7] years) detected no difference in final grade distribution. However, women outperformed men in 5 of 8 domains of clinical performance, including patient interaction (difference, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.04-0.13]), growth mindset (difference, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.01-0.11]), communication (difference, 0.05 [95% CI, 0-0.12]), compassion (difference, 0.125 [95% CI, 0.03-0.11]), and professionalism (difference, 0.07 [95% CI, 0-0.11]). With no difference in examination scores or subjective knowledge evaluation, there was a positive correlation between these variables for both genders (women: r = 0.35; men: r = 0.26) but different elevations for the line of best fit (P < .001). Multivariate regression analyses revealed associations between final grade and patient interaction (women: coefficient, 6.64 [95% CI, 2.16-11.12]; P = .004; men: coefficient, 7.11 [95% CI, 2.94-11.28]; P < .001), subjective knowledge evaluation (women: coefficient, 6.66 [95% CI, 3.87-9.45]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 5.45 [95% CI, 2.43-8.43]; P < .001), reported time spent with the student (women: coefficient, 5.35 [95% CI, 2.62-8.08]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 3.65 [95% CI, 0.83-6.47]; P = .01), and communication (women: coefficient, 6.32 [95% CI, 3.12-9.51]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 4.21 [95% CI, 0.92-7.49]; P = .01). The model based on the men's data also included growth mindset as a significant variable (coefficient, 4.09 [95% CI, 0.67-7.50]; P = .02). For narrative evaluations, words in context with ""he or him"" and ""she or her"" differed, with agentic terms used in descriptions of men and personality descriptors used more often for women.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite no difference in final grade, women scored higher than men on various domains of clinical performance, and performance in these domains was associated with evaluators' suggested final grade. The content of narrative evaluations significantly differed by student gender. This work supports the hypothesis that how students are evaluated in clinical clerkships is associated with gender.",2021,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,4,7,,WOS:000669052900007,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.15661,,#984,Gorth 2021,"",""

This study explores differences in key characteristics of qualitative assessments (i.e., narrative comments or assessment feedback) of internal medicine postgraduate resident performance associated with gender and race and ethnicity.MethodsAnalysis of narrative comments included in faculty assessments of resident performance from six internal medicine residency programs was conducted. Content analysis was used to assess two key characteristics of comments- valence (overall positive or negative orientation) and specificity (detailed nature and actionability of comment) - via a blinded, multi-analyst approach. Differences in comment valence and specificity with gender and race and ethnicity were assessed using multilevel regression, controlling for multiple covariates including quantitative competency ratings.ResultsData included 3,383 evaluations with narrative comments by 597 faculty of 698 residents, including 45% of comments about women residents and 13.2% about residents who identified with race and ethnicities underrepresented in medicine. Most comments were moderately specific and positive. Comments about women residents were more positive (estimate 0.06, p 0.045) but less specific (estimate - 0.07, p 0.002) compared to men. Women residents were more likely to receive non-specific, weakly specific or no comments (adjusted OR 1.29, p 0.012) and less likely to receive highly specific comments (adjusted OR 0.71, p 0.003) or comments with specific examples of things done well or areas for growth (adjusted OR 0.74, p 0.003) than men. Gendered differences in comment specificity and valence were most notable early in training. Comment specificity and valence did not differ with resident race and ethnicity (specificity: estimate 0.03, p 0.32; valence: estimate - 0.05, p 0.26) or faculty gender (specificity: estimate 0.06, p 0.15; valence: estimate 0.02 p 0.54).ConclusionThere were significant differences in the specificity and valence of qualitative assessments associated with resident gender with women receiving more praising but less specific and actionable comments.

Here we characterize the nature of assessment questions in one second-semester general chemistry course over four semesters and report the performance of students regarded to be at risk of failure based on their mathematics placement exam scores (GCI-S students) and their peers (GCI-M students) at the level of each content topic and cognitive question type. Our findings indicate that executing-quantitative questions were overwhelmingly more prevalent than any other question type. Notably, recalling and executing-quantitative question types contributed most to topic-level performance differences between students perceived to be at-risk and their peers. However, these students performed at least as well as their peers on comparing and inferring-predicting questions across most topics, question types that appear to represent relative assets of GCI-S students.

Clicker-integrated instruction and conventional instruction: The comparative evaluations of students' performances in chemistry,"Jammeh, ALJ; Karegeya, C; Ladage, S","Clicker-integrated instruction is the current innovation in teaching and learning. Several studies used this technology to investigate learning processes, while others mainly used it to asses for learning, facilitation of group discussion and students' participation. All applications require creativity and analytical thinking and very much different from conventional instruction where learning is direct and sometimes unreceptive. However, most of those studies either conducted a meta-analysis of the literature or an intervention with a small group to evaluate its impact on teaching and learning. However, the relationship that exists between its integration through intervention and final regional examination results in chemistry was limited in studies. Therefore, the main focus of the present study was to examine the relationship between an intervention and regional examination results. Data collected and analysed were the 2593 students' final chemistry results, between grade levels 1 to 6, as the main requirement for university admission.

Work-Related Stressors Associated with Emergency Calls to the Fire and Rescue Service Operators and Police Operators of the Czech Republic,"Riha, R; Hula, M","Little interest has been shown in the stressors that impact emergency call operators, which can lead to inadequate training. We focus on members of the Czech Fire and Rescue Service (n = 145) and the Czech Police (n = 149) that handle emergency calls. We hypothesized that the most significant stressors would be calls involving suicidal intent and calls involving injured children. We further hypothesized that there would be differences in the perceived stressors based on gender and component of the integrated rescue system (IRS) (i.e., Police vs. Fire and Rescue Service). In-depth interviews with IRS managers were conducted to uncover specific work-related stressors. The stressors identified were evaluated through an online questionnaire using a six-point Likert scale. The results showed that the worst stressors were calls with suicidal intent, calls where the location of the caller was unclear or unknown, and calls involving injured children. Based on a factor analysis of stressors, eight categories were explored: Threat to life, Non-emergency calls, Communication, Noise, Localization, Understanding, Children and seniors, and Time pressure. Three of the eight categories, Non-emergency calls, Communication, and Understanding, were perceived differently relative to the branch of the IRS, and two factors, Non-emergency calls and Understanding, were perceived differently relative to gender.

Ethnic/Racial Bias in Medical School Performance Evaluation of General Surgery Residency Applicants,"Polanco-Santana, JC; Storino, A; Souza-Mota, L; Gangadharan, SP; Kent, TS","OBJECTIVE: Differential use of communal terms (caring/ unselfish traits) versus agentic terms (goal-oriented/leadership/achievement traits) may reveal bias and has been extensively reported in letters of recommendation for residency. We evaluated bias in medical student performance evaluations (MSPE) of general surgery residency applicants.DESIGN: This is a retrospective study evaluating ethnic/race bias, as measured by differential use of agentic and communal terms, in MSPEs of residency applicants. 50% of MSPEs were randomly selected. An ethnic bias calculator derived from an open-source online gender bias calculator was populated with a list of validated agentic and communal terms. Relative frequency of communal and agentic terms was used to estimate bias. Multivariable regression was used to assess the association between the terms and ethnicity/race.PARTICIPANTS: US medical students applying for a categorical surgery residency position at a single academic institution for a single Match cycle.RESULTS: A total of 339 MSPEs were reviewed from 119 US medical schools. Genders were equally represented (women, 51.6%); most participants were white and Asian applicants (79.1%). Overall, MSPEs were more agency biased (65.2%) than communal biased (16.2%) or neutral (18.6%). MSPEs for Black and Hispanic/Latinx applicants were more likely to contain communal rather than agentic terms (adjusted OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.52-6.02) when compared to white and Asian applicants. This finding was independent of MSPE writer's gender or rank.CONCLUSIONS: Surgery residency applicants self-identifying as Black and Hispanic/Latinx were more likely to be described using communal traits compared to white and Asian applicants, suggesting ethnic/racial bias.

Specifically, we set out to: (1) describe the multiple intersectional identities (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, rank, caregiver status, disability status) represented by the faculty, (2) examine potential disparities in well-being, workload, and productivity linked to these intersectional factors, and (3) identify qualitative themes endorsed by faculty as they relate to lived experiences during COVID-19.Methods: This was a cross-sectional mixed-methods research study. The Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota developed and implemented a survey between February-June of 2021 in response to national reports of disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections.Results: There were 291 full-time faculty who participated in the study. Quantitative findings indicated that faculty with multiple intersectional identities (e.g., woman+assistant professor+caregiver+underrepresented in medicine) reported greater depression symptoms, work/family conflict, and stress in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Furthermore, faculty with more intersectional identities reported higher clinical workloads and service responsibilities and lower productivity with regard to research article submissions, publications, and grant submissions in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Qualitative findings supported quantitative findings and broadened understanding of potential underlying reasons.Conclusions: Findings confirm anecdotal evidence that faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections may be disproportionately experiencing negative outcomes from the pandemic. These findings can inform decisions about how to address these disparities moving into the next several years with regard to promotion and tenure, burnout and well-being, and faculty retention in academic medical settings.

The authors applied thematic analysis to all WPI terms, definitions, and survey questions or prompts in the included studies to create a conceptual model of physician WPI.ResultsUltimately, 102 studies were included in the final analysis. The most commonly used WPI terms were work-life balance, work-life integration, and work-home or work-life conflict(s). There was no consistency in the definition of any terms across studies. There was heterogeneity in the way WPI was measured, and only 8 (7.8%) studies used a validated measurement tool.

In this paper, we examine the extent that gender predicts performance across disciplines, and investigate social psychological factors that mediate performance. We also examine whether a gender penalty persists beyond introductory courses, and can be observed in more advanced upper division science courses. We ran analyses (1) across two colleges at a single institution: the College of Biological Sciences and the College of Science and Engineering (i.e., physics, chemistry, materials science, math); and (2) across introductory lower division courses and advanced upper division courses, or those that require a prerequisite. We affirm that exams have disparate impacts based on student gender at the introductory level, with female students underperforming relative to male students.

Based on data from the RGP study we investigated Norwegian RGP's out-of-hours (OOH) work, how the working time was distributed, and to what extent the OOH work affected the regular working hours. Methods In early 2018, an electronic survey was sent to all 4640 RGPs in Norway. Each RGP reported how many minutes that were spent that particular day on various tasks during seven consecutive days. Working time also included additional tasks in the municipality, other professional medical work and OOH primary health care. Differences were analysed by independent t-tests, and regression analyses. Results One thousand eighty hundred seventy-six RGPs (40.4%) responded, 640 (34.1%) had registered OOH work. Male RGPs worked on average 1.5 h more doing regular work than did females (p = 0.001) and on average 2.3 h more OOH work than females (p = 0.079). RGPs with no OOH work registered a mean of 1.0 h more clinical work than RGPs working OOH (p = 0.043). There was a large variation in OOH working hours. A linear regression analysis showed that male RGPs and RGPs in rural areas had the heaviest OOH workload. Conclusions One in three Norwegian RGPs undertook OOH work during the registration week in the RGP study. OOH work was done in addition to a sizeable regular workload as an RGP. We found small gender differences. OOH work was not compensated with reduced regular RGP work.",2020,,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,20,1,,WOS:000582734800001,10.1186/s12913-020-05773-7,,#1001,Rebnord 2020,"",""

To this end, a complete accountability system has been developed through various evaluation procedures. Specifically, this study analyzes the perceptions of university teaching staff on the impact of performance appraisal systems on their professional activity, health and personal lives.Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted a nonexperimental descriptive and causalcomparative design using a questionnaire that was completed by a sample of 2,183 Spanish teachers. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics and comparisons of differences.Findings - The results show that, according to teachers, the evaluation criteria undermine the quality of their work by encouraging them to neglect teaching, increase scientific production and engage in unethical research practices. Their views also emphasize the social and health-related consequences of an increasingly competitive work climate, including increased stress levels. Finally, significant differences are observed regarding gender, professional category and academic discipline, with women, junior faculty and social sciences teachers expressing particularly strong views.Originality/value - The originality of this study lies in the application of a method that contributes to the international debate through a national perspective (Spain) that has so far received little attention.",2023,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,17,7,97-113,WOS:001066495000001,10.1108/JARHE-05-2023-0183,,#1002,Mula-Falcon 2023,"",""
EFFECTS OF GENDER AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STATUS ON FACULTY WORKLOAD RECOMMENDATIONS,"Judson, E; Ross, L","This study examines whether female and underrepresented minority faculty members are subject to minority taxation or bias corrections when it comes to workload. To this end, over 800 biology and physics faculty members at R1 research universities completed an activity wherein they recommended five fictitious faculty members to research, leadership, teaching, and advising roles. Participants were randomly driven to one of three activities: one with Anglo male characters, one containing a female character, and one with a Hispanic male character (i.e., Carl, Cathy, and Carlos, all with equivalent credentials). Among findings, the woman (Cathy) was recommended significantly more to leadership than the men (Carl and Carlos). Interestingly, physics faculty members recommended Carlos twice as often as they recommended Carl and three times more often than they recommended Cathy to sponsor a student group. Recommenders also indicated they considered gender significantly more than race/ethnicity when weighing decisions. Analysis of rationales indicated gender-based implicit biases wherein respondents perceived Cathy more often than Carl or Carlos to possess stereotypical female attributes of being well liked and collaborative. Other patterns found among recommenders' rationales and the effects of the variables gender, URM status, experience, and discipline are discussed.",2021,,JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,27,5,49-82,WOS:001106396800004,,,#1003,Judson 2021,"",""
Accumulated Workload Differences in Collegiate Women's Soccer: Starters versus Substitutes,"Mesa, MF; Stout, JR; Redd, MJ; Fukuda, DH","The purpose of this study was to estimate the workloads accumulated by collegiate female soccer players during a competitive season and to compare the workloads of starters and substitutes. Data from 19 college soccer players (height: 1.58 +/- 0.06 m; body mass: 61.57 +/- 6.88 kg) were extracted from global positioning system (GPS)/heart rate (HR) monitoring sensors to quantify workload throughout the 2019 competitive season. Total distance, distance covered in four speed zones, accelerations, and time spent in five HR zones were examined as accumulated values for training sessions, matches, and the entire season. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Student's t tests were used to determine the level of differences between starter and substitute workloads. Seasonal accumulated total distance (p < 0.001), sprints (>= 19.00 km/h; p < 0.001), and high-speed distance (>= 15.00 km/h; p = 0.005) were significantly greater for starters than substitutes. Accumulated training load (p = 0.08) and training load per minute played in matches (p = 0.08) did not differ between starters and substitutes.

Spirometric Evaluation among Individuals Working in Stone Chip Crushing Factories: A Cross-sectional Study,"Mukherjee, S; Sinha, P; Sengupta, D","Introduction: Silicosis is still one of the most serious occupational health diseases in the world because of its potential to cause physical impairment. It is a progressive and debilitating occupational lung disease that primarily affects workers in the manufacturing, construction and mining industries. Silicosis is mostly caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust. Still, a substantial study on the lung health of stone quarry workers in Western Bengal are still lacking. Aim: To determine the alterations in pulmonary function status (by spirometry) and evaluate the gender differences in pulmonary mechanics among workers affected by occupational silica dust. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a duration of three months to analyse the spirometric changes in lung function among 62 workers exposed to occupational silica dust, aged 18 to 60 years (both genders), attending the Department of Physiology at Rampurhat Government Medical College, West Bengal, India. After obtaining anthropometric measurements, including height and weight of the subjects, spirometry was carried out on each patient according to the recommendations of American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Patients were grouped into categories of normal, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), restrictive pattern, mixed ventilatory defect, and Small Airflow Obstruction (SAO) based on spirometric values of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/ FVC, Forced mid-Expiratory Flow (FEF25%-75%), and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) values. Analysis was performed using GraphPad QuickCalcs software using Chi-square test and Unpaired t-test. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 49.6 years, with 51 (82.26%) males and 11 (17.74%) females among the 62 study subjects. There were 36 (58.06%) smokers and 26 (41.94%) non smokers. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) of the study subjects was 17.268 +/- 2.501 kg/m(2) (underweight category). A significant reduction in spirometric variables was observed below the lower normal limit of percent predicted, including FVC (80-120%), FEV1 (80-120%), PEFR (>60% predicted value for men; up to 100 L/min lower than predicted for males, and 85 L/min for females), FEF (25%-75%) (50%-60% and up to 130% of the average), and Forced Expiratory Time (FET) (6 secs), except for the FEV1/FVC ratio (70-85%), which was higher than the normal limit. The majority of the study subjects belonged to the mixed ventilatory defect category, comprising 36 subjects (58.06%), 17 (27.42%) had a Restrictive Spirometric Pattern (RSP), while the remaining 9 subjects (14.52%) were classified as normal. Conclusion: Detectable spirometric changes have been observed among stone quarry workers, revealing not only restrictive patterns but also mixed ventilatory defects. Necessary preventive and interventional measures should be taken at an early phase to prevent further progression of lung impairment in such a population.",2024,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH,18,11,CC1-CC5,WOS:001358546400001,10.7860/JCDR/2024/73685.20299,,#1005,Mukherjee 2024,"",""
Validation of the Raw National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) Questionnaire to Assess Perceived Workload in Patient Monitoring Tasks: Pooled Analysis Study Using Mixed Models,"Said, S; Gozdzik, M; Roche, TR; Braun, J; Rössler, J; Kaserer, A; Spahn, DR; Nöthiger, CB; Tscholl, DW","Background: Patient monitoring is indispensable in any operating room to follow the patient's current health state based on measured physiological parameters. Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector.Objective: This study aimed to validate a modified version of the raw NASA-TLX in patient monitoring tasks by investigating its correspondence with expected lower and higher workload situations and its robustness against nonworkload-related covariates. This defines criterion validity.Methods: In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness-oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates.Results: We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001).Conclusions: This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. We reported high criterion validity. The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload. Further research should focus on its applicability in a clinical setting.",2020,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,22,9,,WOS:000579498000001,10.2196/19472,,#1006,Said 2020,"",""
Performance evaluations and junior auditors' attitude to audit behavior: a gender and culture comparative study,"Khalil, S; Nehme, R","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed light on factors leading to unethical acts committed by auditors from a cultural and gender perspectives. It investigates differences in junior auditors' attitudes towards audit behavior when a performance evaluation (PE) is anticipated. The objective of this study is to aid academicians and audit executives in developing new models of PE and internship programs that should mitigate dysfunctional behavior. Design/methodology/approach A survey adapted from Big Four companies' performance appraisal templates was administered to junior accountants who have completed their internship programs and their external audit course at accredited universities in Lebanon and the USA. Several statistical tests were conducted to analyze the relationship between the different variables. Findings This paper shows how PE affects junior auditors' attitudes to dysfunctional audit behavior (DAB). From a cultural standpoint, American auditors express more negative views towards DAB than their Lebanese counterparts. This paper also demonstrates that female auditors are less inclined towards DAB than male auditors. Originality/value Previous studies on the topic have been mostly conducted in developed countries with a scarcity of studies examining multiple countries. This study focuses on two different cultural contexts, a developed country, the USA and an emerging country, poorly represented in the literature, Lebanon. This paper also observes variances between male and female auditors in DAB when expecting a PE. The originality of this paper stems from its concurrent examination of the impact of gender and culture on DAB by using a sample of less-experienced auditors at the end of their educational path.",2023,,MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH,31,2,239-257,WOS:000703535700001,10.1108/MEDAR-04-2021-1285,,#1007,Khalil 2023,"",""
Study related factors associated with study engagement and student burnout among German university students,"Olson, N; Oberhoffer-Fritz, R; Reiner, B; Schulz, T","IntroductionStudent burnout has become a health concern in higher education systems. Its prevalence rates are high due to specific demands in this life situation. It leads not only to increased academic dropout rates but is also associated with negative health outcomes both physically and mentally. Its counterpart is study engagement, which is a positive, fulfilling, study-related attitude characterized by energy, dedication, and absorption. There has not been a systematical approach covering the demands directly posed by the academic environment itself. Additionally, academic subject fields apart from medicine and nursing sciences have been mostly neglected in regards to this research field. The aim of the study is therefore to identify contributing factors for both burnout and engagement within the academic environment in a sample of different subject fields at a German university. MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3,451 students of all academic subjects at a technical university in Germany has been analyzed using an online survey. Sociodemographic data, study engagement, student burnout, study satisfaction, academic workload, number of semesters and occupational liabilities have been analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the associations of burnout symptoms and study engagement. ResultsAlmost a third of the students showed frequent burnout symptoms, while 42.5% showed a high degree of study engagement with no differences in gender. Age was identified as a risk factor for frequent signs of cynicism (OR = 1.073). Study satisfaction (OR between 0.459 and 0.702), semester progression (OR = 0.959) and working moderately (OR between 0.605 and 0.637) was associated with fewer symptoms in different burnout-dimensions. Study satisfaction is positively associated with study engagement (OR = 2.676). Academic workload is positively related to both burnout (OR between 1.014 and 1.021) and study engagement (OR = 1.014). DiscussionA substantial number of students show frequent symptoms of burnout and the majority is not highly engaged. The included factors contribute to the model to various degrees and show that university-bound factors play a major role. Fostering a supportive environment is key for study engagement, health and well-being. The inclusion of further, individual factors should be a future concern in order to find and promote strategies for a healthy education system.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,11,,,WOS:000979880900001,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1168264,,#1008,Olson 2023,"",""

The study sample consisted of (81) male and female graduates, with (42) males (51.9%) and (39) females (48.1%). The study used the descriptive approach due to its compatibility to the study nature, and the questionnaire was used as the study instrument for data collection. The study instrument consisted of (4) domains (scientific and practical competencies, communication skills, evaluation, ability to work), where each domain included (6) items. The study data were analyzed by using (SPSS), where the means, standard deviations, t -test, one-way Anova, and least significant difference were used. The results revealed that the degree of having competencies in general was medium and for all the questionnaire's domains. The results revealed that there are no differences between males and females in the level of having competencies and for all the questionnaire's domains. As for the variable of academic estimation, the results revealed that there are statistically significant differences between the categories of academic estimation, where the differences were in favor of the higher academic estimate. Based on the results, the study recommended the necessity of urging the principals in the department of sports rehabilitation to cope with the new developments in their domain and update the academic plan in order to increase the focus on the courses related to health sciences, such as functional anatomy and physiology, in addition to enhancing students to participate in the projects of scientific research within their specialties, especially as the university assigns several scholarships supported by the ministry of higher education.",2024,,REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE PSICOLOGIA DEL EJERCICIO Y EL DEPORTE,19,1,38-44,WOS:001216647500010,,,#1009,Alsoub 2024,"",""
Effects of Department Type and Disability Status on Medical School Faculty Wellbeing,"Abulela, MAA; Schowengerdt, B; Dorr, H; Termuhlen, A; Krohn, K; Violato, C","PurposeFaculty wellbeing impacts student learning and is a priority among medical schools, especially as a counterbalance to growing burnout. Previous researchers found differences in burnout by sex and race among clinicians, but not for faculty with disabilities. Accordingly, the purpose was to test the association between faculty's wellbeing, burnout, and control over workload and investigate differences in wellbeing attributed to department type and ability status.MethodThe authors developed and administered a comprehensive wellbeing survey to University of Minnesota Medical School faculty, of whom 703 provided complete responses. The authors conducted two-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc analysis to test for differences in faculty wellbeing domains due to department type (basic sciences, nonsurgical, surgical, and two large departments of Medicine and Pediatrics) and disability status (yes, no). The authors also fitted a two-way ordinal model since burnout frequency and control over workload were assessed by one ordinal item each.ResultsWellbeing domains were positively correlated with control over workload but negatively associated with burnout. Faculty with disabilities reported less support from their work environment and meeting of their basic needs. Department type had a statistically significant impact on faculty's sense of basic needs, respect, and contribution. Multiple comparisons revealed faculty in basic sciences departments had higher scores within basic needs compared to the departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, and surgical departments, who reported lower levels of respect as well. Results revealed department type and disability status affected the frequency of burnout, as faculty in basic sciences departments reported lower levels of burnout compared to other departments.ConclusionsResults support disaggregating wellbeing by department and ability status for targeted interventions due to differences- notably among faculty with disabilities and surgical departments- in their assessment of basic needs, work environment, respect, and contribution. Results suggest revisiting interventions in these domains to account for lower reported wellbeing.",2025,,HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS,8,1,,WOS:001393001600001,10.1002/hsr2.70317,,#1010,Abulela 2025,"",""

Method The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of clinical performance assessment scores at 6 U.S. IM residency programs from 2016 to 2017. Residents underrepresented in medicine (URiM) were identified using self-reported race/ethnicity. Standardized scores were calculated for Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. Cross-classified mixed-effects regression assessed the association between race/ethnicity and competency scores, adjusting for rotation time of year and setting; resident gender, postgraduate year, and IM In-Training Examination percentile rank; and faculty gender, rank, and specialty. Results Data included 3,600 evaluations by 605 faculty of 703 residents, including 94 (13.4%) URiM residents. Resident race/ethnicity was associated with competency scores, with lower scores for URiM residents (difference in adjusted standardized scores between URiM and non-URiM residents, mean [standard error]) in medical knowledge (-0.123 [0.05], P = .021), systems-based practice (-0.179 [0.05], P = .005), practice-based learning and improvement (-0.112 [0.05], P = .032), professionalism (-0.116 [0.06], P = .036), and interpersonal and communication skills (-0.113 [0.06], P = .044).

We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on depression (prevalence, incidence and/or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined odds ratios using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project.Results: Twenty-two studies (all cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 109,906 participants (51,324 females) in 32 countries (as one study included multiple countries) in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with a clinical diagnostic interview (four studies), interview questions about diagnosis and treatment of depression (three studies) or a validated self-administered rating scale (15 studies). The outcome was defined as incident depression in all 22 studies, with first time incident depression in 21 studies and recurrence of depression in one study. We did not identify any study on prevalence of depression or on mortality from depression. For the body of evidence for the outcome incident depression, we had serious concerns for risk of bias due to selection because of incomplete outcome data (most studies assessed depression only twice, at baseline and at a later follow-up measurement, and likely have missed cases of depression that occurred after baseline but were in remission at the time of the follow-up measurement) and due to missing information on life-time prevalence of depression before baseline measurement.Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) depression of working 41-48 h/week (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.29, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence); 49-54 h/week (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 40%, low quality of evidence); and > 55 h/week (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, 17 studies, 91,142 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences by WHO region, sex, age group and socioeconomic status. Sensitivity analyses found no statistically significant differences by outcome measurement (clinical diagnostic interview [gold standard] versus other measures) and risk of bias (""high""/ ""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains).Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence from human data as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for all three exposure categories, 41-48, 48-54 and >55 h/week, for depression prevalence, incidence and mortality; the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure.

Results: Twenty-two studies (20 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 839,680 participants (364,616 females) in eight countries from three WHO regions (Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (13 studies), self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies), direct diagnosis by a physician (1 study) or during a medical interview (1 study). The outcome was defined as an incident non-fatal stroke event in nine studies (7 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies), incident fatal stroke event in one cohort study and incident non-fatal or fatal (""mixed"") event in 12 studies (all cohort studies).Cohort studies were judged to have a relatively low risk of bias; therefore, we prioritized evidence from these studies, but synthesised evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. stroke incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). Eligible studies were found on the effects of long working hours on stroke incidence and mortality, but not prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were uncertain about the effect on incidence of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.14, 18 studies, 277,202 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence). There may have been an increased risk for acquiring stroke when working 49-54 h/week compared with 35-40 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28, 17 studies, 275,181participants, I-2 0%, p 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working >= 55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring stroke, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61, 7 studies, 162,644 participants, I-2 3%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12, 12 studies, 265,937 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence), 49-54 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, 11 studies, 256,129 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 55 h/week (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.31, 10 studies, 664,647 participants, I-2 20%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region, age, sex, socioeconomic status and type of stroke. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus ""mixed"") except for the comparison working >= 55 h/week versus 35-40 h/week for stroke incidence (p for subgroup differences: 0.05), risk of bias (""high""/""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains), effect estimate measures (risk versus hazard versus odds ratios) and comparator (exact versus approximate definition). Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for all exposure categories for stroke prevalence and mortality and for exposure to 41-48 h/week for stroke incidence. Evidence on exposure to 48-54 h/week and >= 55 h/week was judged as ""limited evidence for harmfulness"" and ""sufficient evidence for harmfulness"" for stroke incidence, respectively. Producing estimates for the burden of stroke attributable to exposures to working 48-54 and >= 55 h/week appears evidencebased, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.",2020,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,142,,,WOS:000546619100005,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105746,,#1014,Descatha 2020,"",""

105 Intersectional Inequities in Emergency Medicine Resident Performance Assessments by Race and Sex,Lett E.; ; Tran N.; Nweke N.; Nguyen M.; Boatright D.,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated gender bias in performance assessments among emergency medicine (EM) residents. However, less work has focused on racial bias, or the intersectional impact of gendered racial bias on residency assessments. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To estimate gendered racial bias in standardized EM resident milestone assessments. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Design: This is a retrospective cohort study using data from Accredited Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) training programs. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): 128 emergency medicine residency programs in the United States. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): 2,708 EM residents training in ACGME-accredited programs (1,913 and 795 in three- and four- year programs, respectively) training from academic year 2014-2015 in 2017 or 2018. Analyses were conducted between June 2020 and January 2023. Exposure: Gendered racial bias as proxied by intersections of underrepresented in medicine (URM) status and gender identity. Main Outcomes: Mean Milestones scores across 6 core competency domains including Interpersonal and Communications Skills, Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Professionalism, and System-Based Practice. Overall assessment scores were calculated as the mean of the 6 competency scores. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 16,634 assessments for 2,708 residents in 128 programs. The ethnoracial identity for most residents was White (68.6%), followed by Asian (17.2%) and URM (14.3%), with majority males (65.4%). We found that, compared to White men, URM women in three-year programs were rated increasingly lower in Medical Knowledge (-0.47, 95% CI: -0.77, -0.17), Patient Care (URM women: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01), and Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (-0.37, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.09) by the postgraduate year (PGY) 3 year-end assessment. URM women were also rated lower in all 6 competencies in four-year programs over the assessment period. Similar but more attenuated differences were detected for URM men, Asian women, and Asian men but at later assessment periods and in specific program lengths. We also observed similar trends for the overall assessment score. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): URM women residents were consistently rated lower than White men during residency, which may reflect gendered racial discrimination in physician competency assessments.

"The influence of work group size and space sharing on the perceived productivity, overall comfort and health of occupants in commercial and academic buildings",Khoshbakht M.; ; Baird G.; Rasheed E.O.,"The influence of work groups (the number of occupants sharing an office) on occupant satisfaction with workplace environments was compared between commercial buildings and academic buildings. Using the Building Use Studies (BUS) methodology, a sample of 5000 surveys was collected over a 12-year period from 67 buildings around the world. In both academic and commercial buildings, solo offices (single occupant) obtained the best scores regarding productivity, overall comfort and health. Academics most disliked middle-sized open-plan offices (shared by 6 to 9 occupants), while in commercial buildings, office occupants most disliked large open-plan offices (shared by over 9 occupants). Occupants had higher productivity and perceived health in commercial buildings than those in academic buildings in all work groups. Productivity decreased as the number of occupants in the office increased in both academic and commercial buildings for all work groups except for middle-sized open-plan offices. Age had a significant influence on occupant perception in different work groups, when comparing commercial and academic buildings. Trivial differences regarding the effect of gender on occupant perception in commercial and academic buildings were also identified.

The impact of gender on resident evaluations of faculty performance,Beaulieu A.; ; Mitzman J.; Buck K.H.; Li-Sauerwine S.,"Background and Objectives: A significant gender gap exists in academic medicine. Implicit bias impacts evaluations of female physicians in residency training and continues to influence factors pertaining to advancement as academic faculty. The goal of this study is to determine if faculty gender impacts the evaluations of academic faculty by residents within the specialty of emergency medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A mixed methods analysis will be employed to examine 14,669 teaching evaluations of faculty by residents at a single academic center between the years 2017-2020. Anonymized ratings of male and female faculty on a five-point Likert scale will be compared using the students' T-test and chi-square test. Qualitative analysis of free-text will be analyzed using grounded theory to examine narrative evaluations for gendered language. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We expect to report a quantitative comparison between evaluations of faculty with respect to gender. We plan to perform subset analyses based on academic rank. We anticipate reporting qualitative outcomes in the form of major themes which emerge during analysis as well as a comparison of narrative evaluations between male and female faculty. Based on prior literature on gender differences and their impact on teaching evaluations, we expect to find gender differences in quantitative ratings of faculty as well as differences in qualitative analysis with respect to learner expectations and cited areas of strength for faculty. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Implicit gender bias has previously been determined to impact evaluations of faculty. These disparities negatively impact promotion and tenure for female faculty.

Attitudes and thoughts of medical practitioners towards their profession in the era of financial crisis in Greece,Nena E.; ; Fasoulakis Z.; Trypsianis G.; Constantinidis T.C.; Kontomanolis E.,"Introduction. The financial crisis which started in Greece about 10 years ago has affected the income of citizens, their quality of life, as well as social and occupational relationships. Aim of the present study was to assess the attitudes towards working conditions and personal life and to explore quality of life, as well as disorders in physical condition, sleep, mood and their predictors, among doctors working or being trained in a tertiary hospital of NE Greece. Methods. Included were 133 medical students and doctors of all ranks (61.7% males) practicing medicine in a university tertiary hospital in Greece. All of them answered a 31-item questionnaire regarding their working conditions, and personal life, daytime activities and sleeping habits. Results. In general, the majority reported dissatisfaction with the work environment, the salary and they rated their quality of life worse than that of the general population. Weekly workload exceeded 60 hours for the majority. No difference between sexes was revealed, with the exception of use of energy drinks which was more prevalent in males (70.7% vs. 51%, p = 0.022). Comparison between ranks revealed that medical students performed better in everyday activities and socialization, although prevalence of reported fatigue was higher in them. Finally, it was demonstrated that surgeons used more frequently medication to achieve sleep promotion (80.4% vs. 36%, p < 0.001) and daily energy (78.4% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). Conclusions.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of multiple years of Society of Reproductive Biologists and Technologists (SRBT) Salary and Job Satisfaction Surveys with comparable publications and benchmarks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SRBT biennial survey data 2001-2018 were analyzed to determine longitudinal trends of salary among reproductive lab personnel. Variables including work environment, benefits, salary of various job titles, clinic setting, gender, job satisfaction and burnout, as well as off-site consulting, were analyzed. Key compensation numbers were compared with national earnings data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and similar clinical lab and biotechnology sector wage surveys. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Total of 1,737 responses were analyzed. Overall, survey responses showed satisfaction with their current jobs and optimism on job market projections. However, the majority of survey responses also indicated significant stress (89% answered medium to extremely high level of stress), burnout (60.6%) and overtime work (72.8%). Most common benefits received were health and dental insurance, paid time-off, retirement plan, and support for conference attendance and certification. In 2018, the average annual clinical workload processed by each hands-on personnel included 108 fresh oocyte retrievals, 88 FETs, 79 biopsies for PGT, and 167 andrology tasks. Throughout the past two decades, nominal compensation (non-inflation adjusted) of reproductive lab professionals steadily increased throughout most of the survey period, with numbers higher than the national average for college/advanced degree workers. Such earnings were higher than most clinical lab specialties as well, with exception in a couple biotechnology sectors. Director earnings increases trended higher to advanced degree workers nationwide. Non-director categories showed a more significant salary growth than nationwide college/advanced degree workers and lab directors. Data from recent years revealed a wider distribution in salary range, which may reflect the volatility due to short supply of senior embryologists. Recent data also demonstrated an increasing portion of bonus in the compensation structure, which may indicate a broader utilization of bonus/incentives across all clinical settings, and possibly a contributing factor to the wider range of compensation among lab personnel. Gender-related difference in compensation remains significant despite an overall smaller gap than nationwide college/ advanced degree workers. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The salary trend of reproductive lab profession show a steady increase throughout the period, a good indication compared to national labor wage and related clinical lab wage benchmarks. However, work-related stress, burnout, overtime duties, and gender pay gap remain issues to be resolved.

Assessment of pelvic examination performance by primary care providers,Jensen J.R.; ; Barnard E.P.; Manning J.B.; Creedon D.J.; Hueppchen N.,"PURPOSE: To assess clinical performance, comfort and perceived importance of routine pelvic examination by primary care physicians (PCPs). <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Family (FM) and internal (IM) medicine physicians at all Mayo Clinic sites (N5801) were electronically surveyed using a modified Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology checklist for pelvic examination. Comparisons were made by specialty, gender, and experience (less than or greater than 5 years; Less Experienced [LE] compared with More Experienced [ME]) using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for scaled items (eg, comfort or importance) using SAS 9. P<.05 was significant. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Two hundred eighty-four (36%) physicians responded. Nearly all (97%) perform pelvic exams. Few (10%) refer to obstetrician-gynecologists for routine exams. IM referred more often than FM (P<.001). There were no gender referral differences. FM were more comfortable with all exam components than IM (P<.001). ME were more comfortable than LE (P<.0001), and did more rectovaginal examinations (P=.0002). Overall rectovaginal exam performance was low (3% LE compared with 12.8% ME). Regardless of experience, most PCPs thought pelvic exams should be performed every 3 years (60% LE compared with 54.6% ME, P5NS). <ovid:br/>DISCUSSION(S): Guidelines surrounding pelvic examination are in flux. Most PCPs currently perform pelvic examinations. FM appear more comfortable than IM. LE physicians were less comfortable and did fewer bimanual and rectovaginal exams than ME. Most PCPs felt exams could be performed less than annually.

Enhanced research assessment performance in graduate vs. undergraduate-entry medical students: Implications for recruitment into academic medicine,Duggan E.M.; ; O'Tuathaigh C.M.P.; Horgan M.; O'Flynn S.,"Background: Studies investigating variance between the academic performance of direct-entry (DEM) versus graduate-entry (GEM) medical students have yielded conflicting results, but their performance in undergraduate research-based assessments has not been compared to-date. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): We aimed to compare the results of DEM and GEM students with respect to their senior research dissertation module. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This retrospective study examined the final year results between 2011-2012 in DEM, (n = 219) and GEM (n = 84) students. Between-group comparisons of dissertation module marks were conducted using independent t-tests. Correlations between marks in dissertation module and in other disciplines assessed during the final year were attained using Pearson's correlation. Multiple regression analysis was employed to adjust for potential confounding factors such as student age and gender. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No apparent difference was apparent between the DEM and GEM students with respect to results achieved across the clinical disciplines examined. However, GEM students performed significantly better than DEMs in their senior research dissertation assessment (Mean = 66.81% vs. 65.00%, fully adjusted p = 0.048). The variable which remained influential in regression analysis was nationality, where North American and Asian students were demonstrated to score lower than their Irish counterparts in the dissertation module (B coefficient = -1.90, SE = 0.94, P = 0.045 and B coefficient = -4.88, SE = 1.00, P < 0.001 respectively). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Performance in the research-based module was significantly better in GEM relative to their DEM colleagues.

Assessment of Gender Bias During Paramedic-Physician Handoffs.,Pettit K; Harris C; Smeltzer K; Sarmiento EJ; Hall JT; Howell C; Liao M; Turner J,"Objective Gender bias against female physicians has been frequently demonstrated and associated with negative feelings toward their careers. Gender bias has also been demonstrated in prehospital clinical care. However, potential gender bias during paramedic-physician handoffs has not been studied. This study aimed to identify gender bias during interactions between prehospital personnel and emergency physicians at the time of patient handoff. Methods An observational study was conducted at an urban academic emergency department. Observers were trained to record information from paramedic-physician handoffs but were blind to the nature of the study. The primary outcome was to whom paramedics initially directed the focus of their handoff report based on physician gender, with secondary outcomes of to whom paramedics directed most of their report and whether they asked about further questions based on physician gender.

There was no significant association between the gender of the physician and which physician received first attention (χ(2) {1, N = 782} = 0.9736, p = 0.3238) or majority attention (χ(2) {1, N = 780} = 1.9414, p = 0.1635). Paramedics were more likely to ask questions to male attendings than female attendings (χ2 {1, N = 784} = 4.4319, p = 0.0353).

Gender Difference in Teaching Evaluation Scores of Pediatric Faculty.,Tiedt K; Webber S; Babal J; Nackers KAM; Allen A; Nacht CL; Coller RJ; Eickhoff J; Sklansky DJ; Kieren M; Shadman KA; Kelly MM,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between faculty gender and milestone-based teaching assessment scores assigned by residents. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of milestone-based clinical teaching assessments of pediatric faculty completed by pediatric residents at a mid-sized residency program from July 2016 to June 2019. Assessments included 3 domains (Clinical Interactions, Teaching Skills, Role Modeling/Professionalism) comprised of a total of 11 sub-competency items. We used multilevel logistic regression accounting for repeat measures and clustering to evaluate associations between faculty gender and assessment scores in the 1) top quartile, 2) bottom quartile, or 3) top-box (highest score). Findings were adjusted for faculty rank and academic track, and resident year and gender. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 2889 assessments of 104 faculty were performed by 91 residents. Between assessments of women and men faculty, there were no significant differences in the odds of receiving a score in the top quartile for the 3 domains (Clinical aOR 0.99, P = .86; Teaching aOR 0.99, P = .93; Role Modeling aOR 0.87, P = .089). However, assessments of women were more likely to receive a score in the bottom quartile in both Teaching (aOR 1.23, P = .019) and Role Modeling (aOR 1.26, P = .008). Assessments of women also had lower odds of receiving the highest score in 6 of 11 sub-competencies.

Gender differences in emergency medicine resident assessment: A scoping review.,Menchetti I; Eagles D; Ghanem D; Leppard J; Fournier K; Cheung WJ,"BACKGROUND: Growing literature within postgraduate medical education demonstrates that female resident physicians experience gender bias throughout their training and future careers. This scoping review aims to describe the current body of literature on gender differences in emergency medicine (EM) resident assessment. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review which adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We included research involving resident physicians or fellows in EM (population and context), which focused on the impact of gender on assessments (concept). We searched seven databases from the databases' inception to April 4, 2022. Two reviewers independently screened citations, completed full-text review, and abstracted data. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. RESULTS: A total of 667 unique citations were identified; 10 studies were included, and all were conducted within the United States. Four studies reported differences in EM resident assessments attributable to gender within workplace-based assessments (qualitative comments and quantitative scores) by both attending physicians and nonphysicians. Six studies investigating clinical competency committee scores, procedural scores, and simulation-based assessments did not report any significant differences attributable to gender. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review found that gender bias exists within EM resident assessment most notably at the level of narrative comments typically received via workplace-based assessments. As female EM residents receive higher rates of negative or critical comments and discordant feedback documented on assessment, these findings raise concern about added barriers female EM residents may face while progressing through residency and the impact on their clinical and professional development.",2022,Oct,AEM Educ Train,6,5,e10808,,10.1002/aet2.10808,36189450,#1048,Menchetti 2022,"",""
Gender bias in resident evaluations: Natural language processing and competency evaluation.,Andrews J; Chartash D; Hay S,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that female trainees experience evaluation penalties for gender non-conforming behaviour during medical training. Studies of medical education evaluations and performance scores do reflect a gender bias, though studies are of varying methodology and results have not been consistent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the differences in word use, competency themes and length within written evaluations of internal medicine residents at scale, considering the impact of both faculty and resident gender. We hypothesised that female internal medicine residents receive more negative feedback, and different thematic feedback than male residents. METHODS: This study utilised a corpus of 3864 individual responses to positive and negative questions over the course of six years (2012-2018) within Yale University School of Medicine's internal medicine residency. Researchers developed a sentiment model to assess the valence of evaluation responses. We then used natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate whether female versus male residents received more positive or negative feedback and if that feedback focussed on different Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies based on their gender. Evaluator-evaluatee gender dyad was analysed to see how it impacted quantity and quality of feedback. RESULTS: We found that female and male residents did not have substantively different numbers of positive or negative comments. While certain competencies were discussed more than others, gender did not seem to influence which competencies were discussed. Neither gender trainee received more written feedback, though female evaluators tended to write longer evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that when examined at scale, quantitative gender differences are not as prevalent as has been seen in qualitative work. We suggest that further investigation of linguistic phenomena (such as context) is warranted to reconcile this finding with prior work.",2021,Dec,Med Educ,55,12,1383-1387,,10.1111/medu.14593,34224606,#1050,Andrews 2021,"",""
Assessment of Implicit Gender Bias During Evaluation of Procedural Competency Among Emergency Medicine Residents.,See A; Pallaci M; Aluisio AR; Beck-Esmay J; Menchine M; Weinstock M; Lam CN; Riddell J,"IMPORTANCE: Gender disparities exist throughout medicine. Recent studies have highlighted an attainment gap between male and female residents in performance evaluations on Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones. Because of difficulties in blinding evaluators to gender, it remains unclear whether these observed disparities are because of implicit bias or other causes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude of implicit gender bias in assessments of procedural competency in emergency medicine residents and whether the gender of the evaluator is associated with identified implicit gender bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 2018 to 2020 in which emergency medicine residency faculty assessed procedural competency by evaluating videos of residents performing 3 procedures in a simulated environment. They were blinded to the intent of the study. Proceduralists were filmed performing each procedure from 2 different viewpoints simultaneously by 2 different cameras. One was a gender-blinded (ie, hands-only) view, and the other a wide-angled gender-evident (ie, whole-body) view. The faculty evaluators viewed videos in a random order and assessed procedural competency on a global rating scale with extensive validity evidence for the evaluation of video-recorded procedural performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based on gender. The secondary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluations based on the gender of the evaluator. RESULTS: Fifty-one faculty evaluators enrolled from 19 states, with 22 male participants (43.1%), 29 female participants (56.9%), and a mean (SD) age of 37 (6.4) years. Each evaluator assessed all 60 procedures: 30 gender-blinded (hands-only view) videos and 30 identical gender-evident (wide angle) videos. There were no statistically significant differences in the study evaluators' scores of the proceduralists based on their gender, and the gender of the evaluator was not associated with the difference in mean scores.

Women's Wellness Through Equity and Leadership (WEL): A Program Evaluation.,Kelly EH; Miskimen T; Rivera F; Peterson LE; Hingle ST,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Women's Wellness through Equity and Leadership (WEL) program was developed as a collaboration between 6 major medical associations in the United States. The goal was to contribute to the creation of equitable work environments for women physicians. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the pilot implementation of WEL. METHODS: Participants included a diverse group of 18 early career to midcareer women physicians from across medical specialties, 3 from each partner organization. WEL was developed as an 18-month program with 3 series focused on wellness, equity, and leadership and included monthly virtual and in-person meetings. After institutional board review approval, a mixed-methods evaluation design was incorporated, which included postseries and postprogram surveys and in-depth telephone interviews. RESULTS: Participants delineated several drivers of program success, including peer support and/or networks; interconnectedness between the topics of wellness, equity, and leadership; and diversity of participants and faculty. Areas for improvement included more opportunities to connect with peers and share progress and more structured mentorship. Regarding program impact, participants reported increased knowledge and behavior change because of their participation.

Gender bias in the evaluation of interns in different medical specialties: An archival study.,Adar R; Kahalon R; Ullrich J; Afek A; Eisenberg VH,"INTRODUCTION: The field of medicine is characterized by within-field gender segregation: Gender ratios vary systematically by subdisciplines. This segregation might be, in part, due to gender bias in the assessment of women and men medical doctors. METHODS: We examined whether the assessments, i.e. overall score, department scores and skills scores, interns receive by their superiors during their internship year, vary as a function of their gender and the representation of women in the field. We analyzed an archival data set from a large hospital in Israel which included 3326 assessments that were given to all interns who completed their internship year between 2015 and 2019. RESULTS: Women received lower department scores and skills scores in fields with a low (versus high) representation of women. Men received higher scores in fields with a high (versus low) representation of men, yet there was no difference in their skills scores. CONCLUSIONS: Women are evaluated more negatively in fields with a low representation of women doctors. Similarly, men are evaluated more negatively in fields with a low representation of men, yet this cannot be explained by their skills. This pattern of results might point to a gender bias in assessments.

A psychometric evaluation of the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale.,Parker RB; Parker PD; Larkin T; Cockburn J,"BACKGROUND: Gender bias within medical education is gaining increasing attention. However, valid and reliable measures are needed to adequately address and monitor this issue. This research conducts a psychometric evaluation of a short multidimensional scale that assesses medical students' awareness of gender bias, beliefs that gender bias should be addressed, and experience of gender bias during medical education. METHODS: Using students from the University of Wollongong, one pilot study and two empirical studies were conducted. The pilot study was used to scope the domain space (n = 28). This initial measure was extended to develop the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (GBMES). For Study 1 (n = 172), confirmatory factor analysis assessed the construct validity of the three-factor structure (awareness, beliefs, experience) and enabled deletion of redundant items. Study 2 (n = 457) tested the generalizability of the refined scale to a new sample. Combining Study 1 and 2, invariance testing for program of study and gender was explored. The relationship of the GBMES to demographic and gender politics variables was tested. The results were analyzed in R using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple-Indicator-Multiple-Indicator-Cause models. RESULTS: After analysis of the responses from the original 16-item GBMES (Study 1), a shortened measure of ten items fitted the data well (RMSEA = .063; CFI = .965; TLI = .951; Mean R-square of items = 58.6 %; reliability: .720-.910) and was found to generalize to a new sample in Study 2 (RMSEA = .068; CFI = .952; TLI = .933; Mean R-square of items = 55.9 %; reliability: .711-.892). The GBMES was found to be invariant across studies, gender, and program of study. Female students and those who supported gender equality had greater agreement for each of the factors. Likewise, postgraduate students reported higher scores on experience of gender bias than undergraduate students. CONCLUSION: The GBMES provides a validated short multidimensional measure for use in research and policy. Given its good reliability across different target populations and its concise length, the GBMES has much potential for application in research and education to assess students' attitudes towards gender bias.",2016,Sep,BMC Med Educ,16,1,251,,10.1186/s12909-016-0774-2,27682146,#1055,Parker 2016,"",""
Student Evaluation of Faculty Physicians: Gender Differences in Teaching Evaluations.,Morgan HK; Purkiss JA; Porter AC; Lypson ML; Santen SA; Christner JG; Grum CM; Hammoud MM,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is a difference in medical student teaching evaluations for male and female clinical physician faculty. METHODS: The authors examined all teaching evaluations completed by clinical students at one North American medical school in the surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and internal medicine clinical rotations from 2008 to 2012. The authors focused on how students rated physician faculty on their ""overall quality of teaching"" using a 5-point response scale (1 = Poor to 5 = Excellent). Linear mixed-effects models provided estimated mean differences in evaluation outcomes by faculty gender. RESULTS: There were 14,107 teaching evaluations of 965 physician faculty. Of these evaluations, 7688 (54%) were for male physician faculty and 6419 (46%) were for female physician faculty. Female physicians received significantly lower mean evaluation scores in all four rotations. The discrepancy was largest in the surgery rotation (males = 4.23, females = 4.01, p = 0.003).

Gender disparities in academic rank achievement in neurosurgery: a critical assessment.,Dossani RH; Terrell D; Kosty JA; Ross RC; Demand A; Wild E; Peterson R; Ngwenya LB; Benzil DL; Notarianni C,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether there are disparities in academic rank and promotion between men and women neurosurgeons. METHODS: The profiles of faculty members from 50 academic neurosurgery programs were reviewed to identify years in practice, number of PubMed-indexed publications, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) attainment, and academic rank. The number of publications at each academic rank was compared between men and women after controlling for years in practice by using a negative binomial regression model. The relationship between gender and each academic rank was also determined after controlling for clustering at the institutional level, years in practice, and number of publications. RESULTS: Of 841 faculty members identified, 761 (90%) were men (p = 0.0001). Women represented 12% of the assistant and associate professors but only 4% of the full professors. Men and women did not differ in terms of the percentage holding a PhD, years in practice, or number of publications at any academic rank.

Gender Differences in Patient Perceptions of Physicians' Communal Traits and the Impact on Physician Evaluations.,Chen H; Pierson E; Schmer-Galunder S; Altamirano J; Jurafsky D; Leskovec J; Fassiotto M; Kothary N,"Background: Communal traits, such as empathy, warmth, and consensus-building, are not highly valued in the medical hierarchy. Devaluing communal traits is potentially harmful for two reasons. First, data suggest that patients may prefer when physicians show communal traits. Second, if female physicians are more likely to be perceived as communal, devaluing communal traits may increase the gender inequity already prevalent in medicine. We test for both these effects. Materials and Methods: This study analyzed 22,431 Press Ganey outpatient surveys assessing 480 physicians collected from 2016 to 2017 at a large tertiary hospital. The surveys asked patients to provide qualitative comments and quantitative Likert-scale ratings assessing physician effectiveness. We coded whether patients described physicians with ""communal"" language using a validated word scale derived from previous work. We used multivariate logistic regressions to assess whether (1) patients were more likely to describe female physicians using communal language and (2) patients gave higher quantitative ratings to physicians they described with communal language, when controlling for physician, patient, and comment characteristics. Results: Female physicians had higher odds of being described with communal language than male physicians (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.40, p < 0.001). In addition, patients gave higher quantitative ratings to physicians they described with communal language. These results were robust to inclusion of controls.

Teaching evaluations play a role in physician advancement. Few studies have investigated gender disparity in resident evaluations of pediatric faculty. We hypothesized that gender disparities in resident evaluations of faculty exist and vary across subspecialties and primary work environments. METHODS: Pediatric faculty institution-specific evaluations completed by residents from January 1, 2015, to March 9, 2020, were obtained from a single academic center. Mean ratings of faculty performance were compared by gender using a Wilcoxon 2-sample test. RESULTS: Fifteen-thousand one-hundred and forty-two evaluations (5091 of male faculty and 10 051 of female faculty) were included. Female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.67 versus male = 4.65; P = .004). There was no statistical difference in the mean ratings of male and female faculty in the inpatient setting, whereas outpatient female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.79 versus male = 4.73; P = .005).

To better characterize equity in the field of radiation oncology, we sought to describe the current academic radiation oncology workforce, including any contemporary differences in compensation and rank by gender and race/ethnicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) 2018 Financial Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with associate or full professor rank. Compensation was compared by gender and race/ethnicity overall and stratified by rank and was further analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Of the 858 academic radiation oncologists from 63 departments in the United States in the sample, 33.2% were female, 65.2% were White, 27.2% were Asian, and 7.6% were underrepresented in medicine (URiM). There were 44.0% assistant professors, 32.0% associate professors, and 22.8% full professors.

Gender equity programmes in academic medicine: a realist evaluation approach to Athena SWAN processes.,Caffrey L; Wyatt D; Fudge N; Mattingley H; Williamson C; McKevitt C,"OBJECTIVES: Gender inequity has persisted in academic medicine. Yet equity is vital for countries to achieve their full potential in terms of translational research and patient benefit. This study sought to understand how the gender equity programme, Athena SWAN, can be enabled and constrained by interactions between the programme and the context it is implemented into, and whether these interactions might produce unintended consequences. DESIGN: Multimethod qualitative case studies using a realist evaluation approach. SETTING: 5 departments from a university medical school hosting a Translational Research Organisation. PARTICIPANTS: 25 hours of observations of gender equality committee meetings, 16 in-depth interviews with Heads of Departments, Committee Leads and key personnel involved in the initiative. 4 focus groups with 15 postdoctoral researchers, lecturers and senior lecturers. RESULTS: The implementation of Athena SWAN principles was reported to have created social space to address gender inequity and to have highlighted problematic practices to staff. However, a number of factors reduced the programme's potential to impact gender inequity. Gender inequity was reproduced in the programme's enactment as female staff was undertaking a disproportionate amount of Athena SWAN work, with potential negative impacts on individual women's career progression. Early career researchers experienced problems accessing Athena SWAN initiatives. Furthermore, the impact of the programme was perceived to be undermined by wider institutional practices, national policies and societal norms, which are beyond the programme's remit. CONCLUSIONS: Gender equity programmes have the potential to address inequity. However, paradoxically, they can also unintentionally reproduce and reinforce gender inequity through their enactment.

The top-rated strategy from each pillar included: 1) nominate gender diverse candidates for faculty positions and prestigious opportunities (equitable access); 2) mandate training in unconscious bias and equitable treatment for committee (e.g., hiring, promotion) members (equitable participation); 3) ensure equitable starting salaries regardless of sex or gender (equitable reimbursement); and, 4) conduct 360° evaluations of leaders (including their direct work circle of supervisors, peers, and subordinates) through a diversity lens (equitable culture). Interprofessional collaboration, leadership, and local champions were identified as key enablers for implementation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified stakeholder-prioritized strategies that can be used to inform and enhance gender equity among physicians in CCM under four overarching equity pillars: access, participation, reimbursement, and culture.

Gender Disparity in Pediatric Surgery: An Evaluation of Pediatric Surgery Conference Participation.,Lee SY; Mor S; Lazar SV; Hassan AS; Farmer DL; Brown EG,"BACKGROUND: Leadership in academic conferences is an important factor for academic advancement. Underrepresentation of women in academic surgical conferences has been demonstrated in other subspecialties, but it has not been well-studied in pediatric surgery. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study analyzes conference participation at 2 national pediatric surgery annual conference programs from 2003 to 2022. Moderator, speakers, and research presenter sex was collected. The primary outcome was the proportion of female participants in each of these roles. Mann-Kendall trend test was conducted to assess for significance. RESULTS: Across 29 meetings, a total of 523 sessions were examined. Overall, female participation in all roles increased from 2003 to 2022. There were statistically positive trends of female participation in leadership roles as moderator (p = 0.003) and speaker (p = 0.01), with moderator role demonstrating the largest proportional female increase over time - with a 7-fold increase from 7.1% in 2003 to 50.0% in 2022. There was also a significant increasing trend in female participation as research presenters (p < 0.01) from 25.4% to 46.4%.

Assessment of Gender-Based Linguistic Differences in Physician Trainee Evaluations of Medical Faculty Using Automated Text Mining.,Heath JK; Weissman GE; Clancy CB; Shou H; Farrar JT; Dine CJ,"IMPORTANCE: Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender. OBJECTIVE: To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1- and 2-word phrases. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]). The individual words art (odds ratio [OR], 7.78; 95% CI, 1.01-59.89), trials (OR, 4.43; 95% CI, 1.34-14.69), master (OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.69-10.63), and humor (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.44-3.73) were significantly associated with evaluations of male faculty, whereas the words empathetic (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.56-12.07), delight (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.35-13.40), and warm (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.83-6.49) were significantly associated with evaluations of female faculty. Two-word phrases associated with male faculty evaluations included run rounds (OR, 7.78; 95% CI, 1.01-59.84), big picture (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 1.68-30.42), and master clinician (OR, 4.02; 95% CI, 1.21-13.36), whereas evaluations of female faculty were more likely to be associated with model physician (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.70-35.39), just right (OR, 6.97; 95% CI, 1.51-32.30), and attention (to) detail (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.36-13.40).

Gender Differences in Language of Standardized Letter of Evaluation Narratives in Osteopathic Emergency Medicine Residency Applicants.,Truong J; Santarelli A; Dawson A; Ashurst J,"Background The standardized letter of evaluation (SLOE) is used by emergency medicine (EM) faculty during the interview and match process. Data has shown that female allopathic applicants score higher in communal characteristics and have a greater number of ability words in the narrative portion of the SLOE as compared to their male counterparts.  Objective To determine if there is a difference in the language used to describe male and female osteopathic applicants within the SLOE.  Methods All applicants to a three-year EM residency within a single application cycle were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included allopathic applicants, applicants without a SLOE, or applicants with a SLOE only from the interviewing program. Data collected included applicant demographics and SLOE narratives. The previously validated Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker Conglomerates, Inc., Austin, TX) product was used to analyze word counts from the narrative portion of each SLOE. Descriptive statistics and t-tests for continuous data were used.  Results Of the 577 applicants to the residency program, 318 met inclusion criteria and 33% were female. Females had a higher COMLEX-2 (590 vs 559; p=0.05) as compared to males but no difference was found for the remainder of the baseline demographics. No difference was found for the number of words in the narrative portion of the SLOE between males and females (males = 122 words; females = 127 words; p=0.53). Words within the social (p=0.006), achievement (p=0.007), and standout (p<0.001) categories were more frequent in osteopathic female applicants as compared to males. No statistical differences were detected for the other 13 categories analyzed.  Conclusion In this sample of osteopathic applicants, little linguistic difference was noted for the narrative portion of the SLOE. SLOE authors did, however, use more social, achievement, and standout words to describe females as compared to male applicants.",2021,Jul,Cureus,13,7,e16622,,10.7759/cureus.16622,34458034,#1070,Truong 2021,"",""

These terms are often misused, although they impact differently on individuals' health. Recognizing the role of sex and gender on health status is fundamental in the pursuit of a personalized medicine. Aim of the current study was to investigate the awareness in approaching clinical and research questions on the impact of sex and gender on health among European internists. Clinicians affiliated with the European Federation of Internal Medicine from 33 countries participated to the study on a voluntary basis between January 1st, 2018 and July 31st, 2019. Internists' awareness and knowledge on sex and gender issues in clinical medicine were measured by an online anonymized 7-item survey. A total of 1323 European internists responded to the survey of which 57% were women, mostly young or middle-aged (78%), and practicing in public general medicine services (74.5%). The majority (79%) recognized that sex and gender are not interchangeable terms, though a wide discrepancy exists on what clinicians think sex and gender concepts incorporate. Biological sex and sociocultural gender were recognized as determinants of health mainly in cardiovascular and autoimmune/rheumatic diseases. Up to 80% of respondents acknowledged the low participation of female individuals in trials and more than 60% the lack of sex-specific clinical guidelines. Internists also express the willingness of getting more knowledge on the impact of sex and gender in cerebrovascular/cognitive and inflammatory bowel diseases. Biological sex and sociocultural gender are factors influencing health and disease.

There are no known studies investigating gender differences in the assessment of procedural skills among emergency medicine (EM) residents, such as those required by ultrasound. The objective of this study was to determine if there are significant gender differences in ultrasound milestone evaluations during EM residency training. METHODS: We used a stratified, random cluster sample of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) EM residency programs to conduct a longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis of resident ultrasound milestone evaluation data. Milestone evaluation data were collected from a total of 16 ACGME-accredited EM residency programs representing a 4-year period. We stratified milestone data by resident gender, date of evaluation, resident postgraduate year, and cohort (residents with the same starting date). RESULTS: A total of 2,554 ultrasound milestone evaluations were collected from 1,187 EM residents (750 men [62.8%] and 444 women [37.1%]) by 104 faculty members during the study period. There was no significant overall difference in mean milestone score between female and male residents [mean difference = 0.01 (95% confidence interval {CI} = -0.04 to 0.05)].

An Evaluation of Sex-Based Differences in Surrogate Consent for Older Adults Undergoing Surgical Intervention.,Nagarkatti N; Miller SM; Ahuja V; Schneider EB; Mohanty S; Kodadek LM,"INTRODUCTION: Differences between female and male patients have been identified in many facets of medicine. We sought to understand whether differences in frequency of surrogate consent for operation exist between older female and male patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was designed using data from the hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients age 65 y and older who underwent operation between 2014 and 2018 were included. RESULTS: Of 51,618 patients identified, 3405 (6.6%) had surrogate consent for surgery. Overall, 7.7% of females had surrogate consent compared to 5.3% of males (P < 0.001). Stratified analysis based on age categories showed no difference in surrogate consent between female and male patients aged 65-74 yy (2.3% versus 2.6%, P = 0.16), but higher rates of surrogate consent in females than males among patients aged 75-84 y old (7.3% versus 5.6%, P < 0.001) and age ≥85 y (29.7% versus 20.8%, P < 0.001). A similar relationship was seen between sex and preoperative cognitive status. There was no difference in preoperative cognitive impairment in female and male patients age 65-74 y (4.4% versus 4.6%, P = 0.58), but higher rates of preoperative cognitive impairment were seen in females than males for those age 75-84 (9.5% versus 7.4%, P < 0.001) and aged ≥85 y (29.4% versus 21.3%, P < 0.001). Matching for age and cognitive impairment, there was no significant difference between rate of surrogate consent in males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients are more likely than males to undergo surgery with surrogate consent. This difference is not based on patient sex alone - females undergoing operation are older than their male counterparts and more likely to be cognitively impaired.",2023,Aug,J Surg Res,288,,246-251,,10.1016/j.jss.2023.02.041,37030182,#1074,Nagarkatti 2023,"",""

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of third-year medical students over the course of ten years (2004 - 2014) at a private medical school in the northern US state of Wisconsin. Each student's performance during their required 6-week obstetrics/gynecology clerkship was assessed by a combination of the student's scores on a clinical performance evaluation and on a standardized national subject examination. The clinical performance evaluations are comprised of 10 domains, each using a 9-point Likert scale and completed by faculty and resident physicians. All clerkships at our institution use the same evaluation form, which was designed and validated by the medical education statistics department. Final obstetrics/gynecology clerkship average clinical evaluation scores (Scale 1-9) and obstetrics/gynecology standardized national subject examination scores (Percentile 1-99) were compared to see if a gender based difference between subject examination and performance evaluation scores existed. RESULTS: 1,976 student records were analyzed.

Several text-to-image generative AI tools are used for producing images that represent the medical imaging professions. White male stereotyping and masculine cultures can dissuade women and ethnically divergent people from being drawn into a profession. Methods: In March 2024, DALL-E 3, Firefly 2, Stable Diffusion 2.1, and Midjourney 5.2 were utilized to generate a series of individual and group images of medical imaging professionals: radiologist, nuclear medicine physician, radiographer, and nuclear medicine technologist. Multiple iterations of images were generated using a variety of prompts. Collectively, 184 images were produced for evaluation of 391 characters. All images were independently analyzed by 3 reviewers for apparent gender and skin tone. Results: Collectively (individual and group characters) (n = 391), 60.6% were male and 87.7% were of a light skin tone. DALL-E 3 (65.6%), Midjourney 5.2 (76.7%), and Stable Diffusion 2.1 (56.2%) had a statistically higher representation of men than Firefly 2 (42.9%) (P < 0.0001).

Sex differentials are well documented in children younger than 5 years but have not been systematically examined for ages 5-24 years. We aimed to estimate the sex ratio of mortality from birth to age 24 years and reconstruct trends in sex-specific mortality between 1990 and 2021 for 200 countries, major regions, and the world. METHODS: We compiled comprehensive databases on the mortality sex ratio (ratio of male to female mortality rates) for individuals aged 0-4 years, 5-14 years, and 15-24 years. The databases contain mortality rates from death registration systems, full birth and sibling histories from surveys, and reports on household deaths in censuses. We modelled the sex ratio of age-specific mortality as a function of the mortality in both sexes using Bayesian hierarchical time-series models. We report the levels and trends of sex ratios and estimate the expected female mortality and excess female mortality rates (the difference between the estimated female mortality and the expected female mortality) to identify countries with outlying sex ratios. FINDINGS: Globally, the mortality sex ratio was 1·13 (ie, boys were more likely to die than girls of the same age) for ages 0-4 years (90% uncertainty interval 1·11 to 1·15) in 2021. This ratio increased with age to 1·16 (1·12 to 1·20) for 5-14 years, reaching 1·65 for 15-24 years (1·52 to 1·75). In all age groups, the global sex ratio of mortality increased between 1990 and 2021, driven by faster declines in female mortality. In 2021, the probability of a newborn male reaching age 25 years was 94·1% (93·7 to 94·4), compared with 95·1% for a newborn female (94·7 to 95·3). We found a disadvantage of females versus males (compared with countries with similar total mortality) in 2021 in five countries for ages 0-4 years (Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, and Iran), one country (Suriname) for ages 5-14 years, and 13 countries for ages 15-24 years (including Bangladesh and India). We found the reverse pattern (disadvantage of males vs females compared with countries of similar total mortality) in one country in ages 0-4 years (Vietnam) and eight countries in ages 15-24 years (including Brazil and Mexico). Globally, the number of excess female deaths from birth to age 24 years was 86 563 (-6059 to 164 000) in 2021, down from 544 636 (453 982 to 633 265) in 1990. INTERPRETATION: The global sex ratio of mortality for all age groups in the first 25 years of life increased between 1990 and 2021. Targeted interventions should focus on countries with outlying sex ratios of mortality to reduce disparities due to discrimination in health care, nutrition, and violence.

Gender Differences in Language of Standardized Letter of Evaluation Narratives for Emergency Medicine Residency Applicants.,Li S; Fant AL; McCarthy DM; Miller D; Craig J; Kontrick A,"OBJECTIVE: While gender differences in language for letters of recommendation have been identified in other fields, no prior studies have evaluated the narrative portion of the emergency medicine (EM) standardized letter of evaluation (SLOE). We aim to examine the differences in language used to describe male and female applicants within the SLOE narrative. METHODS: Invited applicants to a 4-year academic EM residency program within a single application year with a SLOE were included in the sample. Exclusion criteria were SLOE of applicants from non-Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) schools or first rotation SLOE not available for download. Data were collected on applicant gender, age, rotation grade, Alpha Omega Alpha designation, and medical school rank. The previously validated Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program was used to analyze frequency of words within categories relevant to letters of recommendation. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square tests were employed in analysis. RESULTS: Of 1,025 applicants within a single application year, 265 were invited to interview; 237 applicants had a first rotation SLOE available for analysis. There were no differences between male and female applicants for baseline characteristics. The median word count per SLOE narrative was 199; within the LIWC dictionary and user-defined categories, words within the categories of affiliation and ability appeared more frequently for female applicants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with respect to the SLOE narrative reinforce prior research that letters of recommendation for female applicants highlight communal characteristics of teamwork, helpfulness, and compassion. Contrary to prior research, ability words highlighting intelligence and skill appeared with greater frequency for female applicants. No pervasive differences were found in other word categories. In this sample, the standardized format of the SLOE resulted in letters that were relatively free of gender bias.",2017,Oct,AEM Educ Train,1,4,334-339,,10.1002/aet2.10057,30051052,#1081,Li 2017,"",""
Gender Disparity in Surgery: An Evaluation of Surgical Societies.,Lyons NB; Bernardi K; Huang L; Holihan JL; Cherla D; Martin AC; Milton A; Loor M; Ko TC; Liang MK; Hydo L,"Background: The percentage of female surgeons and surgery residents has increased slowly to 24% and 35%, respectively. However, women remain under-represented in surgical leadership positions (<20%). Society awards and leadership positions are used for hiring and promoting surgeons. We hypothesized that within the Surgical Infection Society (SIS), females are under-represented. Methods: The SIS website and databases were consulted for the number of female members, awardees, and leaders. Representation was divided into four time periods: 2000-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2017 and compared for changes over time utilizing a Χ(2) test. In addition, we reviewed the council members of five other surgical societies and compared the percentage of female representation in leadership positions. Results: Since the SIS was founded, there have been 587 members of whom only 135 (23%) are female. There has been an increase in female membership over time (p < 0.001). The number of female awardees rose from 37% during the first two study periods to more than 50% in the last two periods (p = 0.002). However, female representation in leadership positions decreased from 26% in 2000-2005 to less than 15% in the last three study periods (p = 0.234). Similar disparities emerged when comparing the SIS with other surgical societies: Women have represented only 24% (range 8%-42%) of leaders and 4% (range 0-11%) of society presidents. Conclusions: Female surgeons are under-represented in the SIS membership and leadership positions. Whereas the number of female surgeons and residents has increased, these trends have not occurred with council membership and leadership within the SIS.

Exploring the Impact of the Surgical Exploration and Discovery (SEAD) Program on Medical Students' Perceptions of Gender Biases in Surgery: A Mixed-Method Evaluation.,Deng M; Nham E; Malvea A; Ramsay T; Seabrook C; Watterson J,"OBJECTIVE: Female representation in surgery is increasing; however, many surgical specialties continue to observe disproportionately fewer females entering their residencies. This study assesses how medical students' gender-based perceptions of surgical careers are impacted by attending the Surgical Exploration and Discovery (SEAD) program, a 2-week, immersive procedural program that offers observerships, mentorship, and workshops across 8 surgical specialties. DESIGN: In this mixed-method prospective cohort study, medical students' awareness, beliefs, and experiences of gender bias in surgery were assessed using a 10-item Gender Bias in Medical Students Assessment-Surgery (GBMSA-S) psychometric survey instrument inspired by the validated Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (Parker et al., 2016). SETTING: Undergraduate Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen first-year medical students in the experimental group (8 male, 10 female) and 18 in the control group (7 male, 11 female). RESULTS: Compared to the control group, SEAD participants had significant changes in agreement with the statements: ""surgery is male-dominated,"" ""medical studies are mainly done in males,"" ""gender discrimination is more pronounced in surgery than other medical professions,"" ""consideration of my gender is an important factor in whether or not to pursue surgery as a career,"" and ""I have encountered gender-biased attitudes and/or behaviors among non-physician health care staff"" (p < 0.05). Perceptions of gender bias were reduced post-SEAD. Subgroup analysis by gender suggested that the significance of these changing perspectives was due to female participants' responses. SEAD also produced an increase in the level of interest in surgery (p = 0.04). Receptive and authentic dialogue was identified as a critical step toward social inclusivity (n = 11).

The Standardized Letter of Evaluation Narrative: Differences in Language Use by Gender.,Miller DT; McCarthy DM; Fant AL; Li-Sauerwine S; Ali A; Kontrick AV,"INTRODUCTION: Prior research demonstrates gender differences in language used in letters of recommendation. The emergency medicine (EM) Standardized Letter of Evaluation (SLOE) format limits word count and provides detailed instructions for writers. The objective of this study is to examine differences in language used to describe men and women applicants within the SLOE narrative. METHODS: All applicants to a four-year academic EM residency program within a single application year with a first rotation SLOE available were included in the sample. We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program to analyze word frequency within 16 categories. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared, and t-tests were used to describe the sample; gender differences in word frequency were tested for using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Of 1117 applicants to the residency program, 822 (82%) first-rotation SLOEs were available; 64% were men, and 36% were women. We did not find a difference in baseline characteristics including age (mean 27 years), top 25 schools (22.5%), Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society rates (13%), and having earned advanced degrees (10%). The median word count per SLOE narrative for men was 171 and for women was 180 (p = 0.15). After adjusting for letter length, word frequency differences between genders were only present in two categories: social words (women: 23 words/letter; men: 21 words/letter, p = 0.02) and ability words (women: 2 words/letter; men: 1 word/letter, p = 0.04). We were unable to detect a statistical difference between men and women applicants in the remaining categories, including words representing communal traits, agentic traits, standout adjectives, grindstone traits, teaching words, and research words. CONCLUSION: The small wording differences between genders noted in two categories were statistically significant, but of unclear real-world significance.

Disparity in Gender Representation of Speakers at National Emergency Medical Services Conferences: A Current Assessment and Proposed Path Forward.,Davic A; Carey E; Lambert E; Luckingham T; Mongiello N; Peralta R; Puccio N; Rivera K; Torre K; Maloney LM,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparities between Emergency Medicine physicians with regards to salary, promotion, and scholarly recognition as national conference speakers have been well-documented. However, little is known if similar gender disparities impact their out-of-hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) colleagues. Although there have been improvements in the ratio of women entering the EMS workforce, gender representation has improved at a slower rate for paramedics compared to emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Since recruitment, retention, and advancement of females within a specialty have been associated with the visibility of prominent, respected female leaders, gender disparity of these leaders as national conference speakers may contribute to the ""leaky pipeline effect"" seen within the EMS profession. Gender representation of these speakers has yet to be described objectively. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if disparity exists in gender representation of speakers at well-known national EMS conferences and trade shows in the United States (US) from 2016-2020. The secondary objective was to determine if males were more likely than females to return to a conference as a speaker in subsequent years. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of programs from well-known national conferences, specifically for EMS providers, which were held in the US from 2016-2020 was performed. Programs were abstracted for type of conference session (pre-conference, keynote, main conference) and speakers' names. Speaker gender (male, female) was confirmed via internet search. RESULTS: Seventeen conference programs were obtained with 1,709 conference sessions that had a total of 2,731 listed speaker names, of whom 537 (20%) were female. A total of 30 keynote addresses had 39 listed speaker names of whom six (15%) were female. No significant difference was observed in the number of years males returned to present at the same conference as compared to females. CONCLUSION: Gender representation of speakers at national EMS conferences in the US is not reflective of the current best estimate of the US EMS workforce. This disparity exists not only in the overall percent of female names listed as speakers, but also in the percent of individual female speakers, and is most pronounced within keynote speakers. Online lecture platforms, as an unintentional consequent of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with intentional speaker development and mentorship initiatives, may reduce barriers to facilitating a new pipeline for more females to become speakers at national EMS conferences.",2021,Aug,Prehosp Disaster Med,36,4,445-449,,10.1017/S1049023X21000571,34190038,#1086,Davic 2021,"",""
Is there a gender bias in recommendations for further rehabilitation in primary care of patients with chronic pain after an interdisciplinary team assessment?,Stålnacke BM; Haukenes I; Lehti A; Wiklund AF; Wiklund M; Hammarström A,"OBJECTIVE: To examine potential gender bias in recommendations of further examination and rehabilitation in primary care for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain after an interdisciplinary team assessment. METHODS: The population consisted of consecutive patients (n = 589 women, 262 men) referred during a 3-year period from primary healthcare for assessment by interdisciplinary teams at a pain specialist rehabilitation clinic. Patient data were collected from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation. The outcome was defined as the examination or rehabilitation that was specified in the patient's record. RESULTS: Men had a significantly higher likelihood than women of being recommended physiotherapy and radiological examination, and the gender difference was not explained by confounding variables and covariates (age, marital status, ethnicity, education, working status, pain severity, pain interference, pain sites, anxiety and depression). There was no significant gender difference in recommendations to treatment by specialist physician, occupational therapist, psychologist or social worker. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the interdisciplinary teams in specialist healthcare may discriminate against women with chronic pain when physiotherapy and radiological investigation are recommended. The team's choice of recommendations might be influenced by gendered attitudes, but this field of research needs to be studied further.",2015,Apr,J Rehabil Med,47,4,365-71,,10.2340/16501977-1936,25587848,#1088,Stålnacke 2015,"",""
"Ecological momentary assessment of daily discrimination experiences and nicotine, alcohol, and drug use among sexual and gender minority individuals.",Livingston NA; Flentje A; Heck NC; Szalda-Petree A; Cochran BN,"OBJECTIVE: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience elevated rates of minority stress, which has been linked to higher rates of nicotine and substance use. Research on this disparity to date is largely predicated on methodology that is insensitive to within day SGM-based discrimination experiences, or their relation to momentary nicotine and substance use risk. We address this knowledge gap in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). METHOD: Fifty SGM individuals, between 18 and 45 years of age, were recruited from an inland northwestern university, regardless of their nicotine or substance use history, and invited to participate in an EMA study. Each were prompted to provide data, six times daily (between 10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.) for 14 days, regarding SGM-based discrimination, other forms of mistreatment, and nicotine, drug, and alcohol use since their last prompt. RESULTS: Discrimination experiences that occurred since individuals' last measurement prompt were associated with greater odds of nicotine and substance use during the same measurement window. Substance use was also more likely to occur in relation to discrimination reported two measurements prior in lagged models. Relative to other forms of mistreatment, discrimination effects were consistently larger in magnitude and became stronger throughout the day/evening. CONCLUSION: This study adds to existing minority stress research by highlighting the both immediate and delayed correlates of daily SGM-based discrimination experiences. These results also contribute to our understanding of daily stress processes and provide insight into ways we might mitigate these effects using real-time monitoring and intervention technology.

METHODS: Cross sectional study of an IRB-approved prospective, cohort study from a GCRAC. Data evaluated included: age, race, referral provider specialty and indication, genetic testing frequency, as well as frequency and types of pathogenic variants. RESULTS: 588 WW and 57 BW were evaluated from 1/2010-12/2015. Although approximately one-third of BW and WW were referred for family history alone, referral indications varied. BW were more likely referred for a known pathogenic variant (20.0% vs. 6.2%) although less likely referred for a personal history of ovarian cancer (24.0% vs. 46.8%; p = 0.0023). While gynecologic oncologists referred most patients (BW 43.6% vs. WW 63.0%), BW were more likely to be referred by surgical oncologist (23.0% vs. 12.8%) or genetic counselor (12.8% vs. 5.9%) than WW (p = 0.0234).

This was a cross-sectional survey study among 1,988 patients at a university Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine outpatient clinic. To assess DIF, WHODAS 2.0 items were dichotomized as `none' rated by respondents as `0' versus `any limitation' rated as `1,2,3 or 4'. The item response theory analysis was used to define discrimination and difficulty parameters of a questionnaire. The probit logistic regression was used to test uniformity of DIF between gender groups. The results of DIF analysis were presented and evaluated graphically as item characteristic curves based on 2-parameter IRT analysis of dichotomized responses. High to perfect discrimination ability was observed for all the items except one. Difficulty levels of eight items were shifted towards the elevated disability level, four items demonstrated a perfect difficulty property. Significant DIF between genders was observed in seven of 12 items. The detected DIFs were uniform.

A Protocol to Assess Contextual Factors During Program Impact Evaluation: A Case Study of a STEM Gender Equity Intervention in Higher Education.,Nobrega S; Edwards K; Ghaziri ME; Giacobbe L; Rice S; Punnett L,"Program evaluations that lack experimental design often fail to produce evidence of impact because there is no available control group.

Social Inequity and Structural Barriers to Completion of Ecological Momentary Assessments for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men and Trans Women Living With HIV in San Francisco.,Turner CM; Arayasirikul S; Trujillo D; Lê V; Wilson EC,"BACKGROUND: Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) administered via text messaging facilitate real-time data collection. With widespread cell phone access, EMAs are becoming more available to even the most disenfranchised communities, such as those living with HIV. However, structural barriers disproportionately burden young men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans women (TW) living with HIV and threaten participation in HIV research. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify structural barriers to completing EMA text surveys nested within a digital HIV care intervention for young MSM and TW living with HIV in San Francisco. METHODS: A total of 10,800 EMA text messages were delivered daily over 90 days to 120 participants enrolled in the Health eNav intervention (2017-2018) at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. EMA surveys inquired about participants' daily affect, sexual behaviors, substance use, and treatment adherence. Survey completion was calculated after 30, 60, and 90 days of follow-up. We described characteristics of nonstarters (those who provided less than four complete responses to the first seven EMA surveys) and analyzed structural correlates of days to first weeklong or more EMA survey noncompletion using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Qualitative interviews were used to evaluate the acceptability of EMA surveys. RESULTS: Participants completed 4384 of 10,800 (40.59%) EMA surveys. Completion of 70% or more of EMA surveys was attained by 56 of 120 participants (46.7%) at 30 days of follow-up, 40/120 (33.3%) at 60 days of follow-up, and 30/120 (25.0%) by the end of the 90-day study period. Twenty-eight participants (23.3%) were identified as nonstarters, and were more likely to be recently incarcerated (prevalence ratio [PR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.4), forego basic needs for HIV medications (PR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5), and be diagnosed with HIV in the last year (PR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.1). Adjusting for nonstarters, young MSM and TW living in temporary/transitional housing (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0), foregoing HIV medications to afford basic needs (aHR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7), and having less than a college education (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-9.0) had greater hazard of weeklong or more EMA survey noncompletion. Overall, there was high acceptability of the EMA surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Although access to and use of technology is increasingly ubiquitous, this analysis demonstrates persisting gaps in EMA completion by socioeconomic factors such as incarceration, education level, housing, and competing needs for young MSM and TW living with HIV in San Francisco. Moreover, those recently diagnosed with HIV were more likely to experience an immediate drop-off in completing EMA surveys. EMAs are feasible for individuals not experiencing social inequity and structural barriers. HIV prevention technologies addressing these barriers and leveraging similar methodology may prove effective for young MSM and TW living with HIV.",2019,May,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,7,5,e13241,,10.2196/13241,31066714,#1094,Turner 2019,"",""
