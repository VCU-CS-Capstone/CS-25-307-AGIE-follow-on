Towards comparable ratings: Exploring bias in German physician reviews,"Kersting, J.; Maoro, F.; Geierhos, M.","In this study, we evaluate the impact of gender-biased data from German-language physician reviews on the fairness of fine-tuned language models. For two different downstream tasks, we use data reported to be gender biased and aggregate it with annotations. First, we propose a new approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis that allows identifying, extracting, and classifying implicit and explicit aspect phrases and their polarity within a single model. The second task we present is grade prediction, where we predict the overall grade of a review on the basis of the review text. For both tasks, we train numerous transformer models and evaluate their performance. The aggregation of sensitive attributes, such as a physician's gender and migration background, with individual text reviews allows us to measure the performance of the models with respect to these sensitive groups. These group-wise performance measures act as extrinsic bias measures for our downstream tasks. In addition, we translate several gender-specific templates of the intrinsic bias metrics into the German language and evaluate our fine-tuned models. Based on this set of tasks, fine-tuned models, and intrinsic and extrinsic bias measures, we perform correlation analyses between intrinsic and extrinsic bias measures. In terms of sensitive groups and effect sizes, our bias measure results show different directions. Furthermore, correlations between measures of intrinsic and extrinsic bias can be observed in different directions. This leads us to conclude that gender-biased data does not inherently lead to biased models. Other variables, such as template dependency for intrinsic measures and label distribution in the data, must be taken into account as they strongly influence the metric results. Therefore, we suggest that metrics and templates should be chosen according to the given task and the biases to be assessed.

Beyond traditional interviews: Psychometric analysis of asynchronous video interviews for personality and interview performance evaluation using machine learning,"Koutsoumpis, Antonis; Ghassemi, Sina; Oostrom, Janneke K.; Holtrop, Djurre; van Breda, Ward; Zhang, Tianyi; de Vries, Reinout E.","With the advent of new technology, traditional job interviews have been supplemented by asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). However, research on psychometric properties of AVIs is limited. In this study, 710 participants completed a mock AVI responding to eight personality questions (Extraversion, Conscientiousness). We collected self- and observer reports of personality, interview performance ratings, attractiveness, and AVI meta-information (e.g., professional attire, audio quality). Then, we automatically extracted the words, facial expressions, and voice characteristics from the videos and trained machine learning models to predict the personality traits and interview performance. Our algorithm explained substantially more variance in observer reports of Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.32) and interview performance (R2 = 0.44), than self-reported Extraversion and Conscientiousness (average R2 = 0.12). Consistent with Trait Activation Theory, the explained variance in personality traits increased when participants responded to trait-relevant, compared to trait-irrelevant, questions. The test-retest reliability of our algorithm was somewhat stable over a time period of seven months, but lower than desired reliability standards in personnel selection. We examined potential sources of bias, including age, gender, and attractiveness, and found some instances of algorithmic bias (e.g., gender differences were often amplified in favor of women).

Assessing fairness in machine learning models: A study of racial bias using matched counterparts in mortality prediction for patients with chronic diseases,"Wang, Y.; Wang, L.; Zhou, Z.; Laurentiev, J.; Lakin, J.R.; Zhou, L.; Hong, P.","ObjectiveExisting approaches to fairness evaluation often overlook systematic differences in the social determinants of health, like demographics and socioeconomics, among comparison groups, potentially leading to inaccurate or even contradictory conclusions. This study aims to evaluate racial disparities in predicting mortality among patients with chronic diseases using a fairness detection method that considers systematic differences.MethodsWe created five datasets from Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR), each focusing on a different chronic condition: congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic liver disease (CLD), and dementia. For each dataset, we developed separate machine learning models to predict 1-year mortality and examined racial disparities by comparing prediction performances between Black and White individuals. We compared racial fairness evaluation between the overall Black and White individuals versus their counterparts who were Black and matched White individuals identified by propensity score matching, where the systematic differences were mitigated.ResultsWe identified significant differences between Black and White individuals in age, gender, marital status, education level, smoking status, health insurance type, body mass index, and Charlson comorbidity index (p-value p = 0.043), in the CKD cohort for insurance type (p = 0.005) and education level (p = 0.016), and in the dementia cohort for body mass index (p = 0.041); with no significant differences for other covariates. When examining mortality prediction models across the five study cohorts, we conducted a comparison of fairness evaluations before and after mitigating systematic differences. We revealed significant differences in the CHF cohort with p-values of 0.021 and 0.001 in terms of F1 measure and Sensitivity for the AdaBoost model, and p-values of 0.014 and 0.003 in terms of F1 measure and Sensitivity for the MLP model, respectively.Discussion and conclusionThis study contributes to research on fairness assessment by focusing on the examination of systematic disparities and underscores the potential for revealing racial bias in machine learning models used in clinical settings.

Exploring the Impact of Digital Competence and Technology Acceptance on Academic Performance in Physical Education and Sports Science Students,"Rodafinos, A.; Barkoukis, V.; Tzafilkou, K.; Ourda, D.; Economides, A.; Perifanou, M.","Aim/Purpose This study aims to examine the influence of digital competences, technology acceptance, and individual factors (gender and educational level) on academic achievement in Physical Education and Sports Science (PESS). Background Prior research has established a positive correlation between digital competences and performance, but the mediating role of technology acceptance remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the literature about this relationship among students pursuing degrees in PESS. Methodology A survey was administered to 344 students pursuing degrees in PESS. The Students' Digital Competence Scale (SDiCoS) measured digital competences, while the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assessed technology acceptance. Academic performance was evaluated based on students' GPAs. Contribution This paper investigated the role of digital competence within the TAM framework and its influence on academic performance. We propose that digital competence variables positively impact students' intention to use digital tools for learning. This aligns with TAM principles, where intention and attitude toward technology predict its actual use. Our findings further strengthen the understanding of TAM by confirming strong connections between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward technology. Additionally, the study suggests that digital competence and frequent device usage patterns might be more prevalent in postgraduate education. Findings The investigation supports the link between digital competences and technology acceptance in PESS students. Specifically, TAM variables, particularly attitudes and intentions regarding technology use, significantly predicted these students' academic performance. Interestingly, no direct association was found between SDiCoS digital competences and academic performance. Digital competence variables were positively associated with students' intention to use digital tools for learning. Gender differences emerged, with females reporting higher academic performance and proficiency in Communicate, Collaborate, and Share (CCS) competences. Furthermore, postgraduate students reported digital competences, higher academic performance, stronger intentions to use technology, and more frequent utilization of laptops/tablets. Recommendations for Practitioners Educators, administrators, and policymakers should consider targeted interventions and curriculum development to enhance academic performance in the fields of physical education and sports science. Specifically, strategies should focus on fostering digital competences in areas relevant to the field while addressing gender-specific needs. Recommendations for Researchers Future research should further explore the nuanced relationship between digital competences, technology acceptance, and academic performance, with a focus on refining the predictive efficacy of TAM variables and examining the role of individual factors, such as motivation and self-efficacy. Impact on Society The findings have implications for improving academic outcomes in PESS, ultimately contributing to the development of a highly skilled and technology-literate workforce in this field. Future Research Future research should examine the specific mechanisms through which digital competences and technology acceptance influence academic performance to develop effective interventions and strategies.",2024,/,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,23,,1-25,,10.28945/5309,,#674,Rodafinos 2024,"",""
Ten questions in sports engineering: technology in elite womenâs football,"Okholm Kryger, Katrine; Thomson, Athol; Tang, Alicia; Brown, Nicola; Bruinvels, Georgie; Rosenbloom, Craig; Carmody, Sean; Williamson, Leah; Datson, Naomi; Jobson, Elena; Mehta, Ritan","The use of technology in football is increasing, although, products predominantly focus on menâs football in performance, safety, comfort, and fit considerations. A recent scoping review identified just 32 published scientific articles on technology in womenâs football, despite demands of those playing/working in the womenâs game increasing. We wish to highlight the progressions made so far and barriers remaining in the elite womenâs football technology to shed a light on this topic and prod researchers and manufacturers to help support the evolution of womenâs-football-focussed technological considerations. The ten questions presented in this paper address the generic question on whether womenâs specific tailoring is needed (Question 1) as well as addressing specific questions on football technology and engineering, such as the progressions made and ongoing issues in the following areas: football kits, religious considerations (hijab designs), sports bras, football boots, balls, football pitches, performance tracking devices, menstrual cycle tracking devices (Question 2â10). It is evidence that certain areas have received more attention than others and with these ten questions we hope to steer readers towards research and engineering gaps for future work.

Performance analysis of machine learning algorithms and screening formulae for Î²-thalassemia trait screening of Indian antenatal women,"Das, R.; Saleh, S.; Nielsen, I.; Kaviraj, A.; Sharma, P.; Dey, K.; Saha, S.","Background Currently, more than forty discrimination formulae based on red blood cell (RBC) parameters and some supervised machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have been recommended for Î²-thalassemia trait (BTT) screening. The present study was aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of 26 such formulae and 13 MLAs on antenatal woman data with a recently developed formula SCSBTT, which is available for evaluation in over seventy countries as an Android app, called SUSOKA[16]. Methods A diagnostic database of 2942 antenatal females were collected from PGIMER, Chandigarh, India and was used for this analysis. The data set consists of hypochromic microcytic anemia, BTT, Hemoglobin E trait, double heterozygote for Hemoglobin S and BTT, heterozygote for Hemoglobin D Punjab and normal subjects. Performance of the formulae and the MLAs were assessed by Sensitivity, Specificity, Youden's Index, and AUC-ROC measures. A final recommendation was made from the ranking obtained through two Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques, namely, Simultaneous Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives (SECA) and TOPSIS.ResultsIt was observed that Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) showed maximum Youden's index and AUC-ROC measures compared to all discriminating formulae. Sensitivity remains maximum for SCSBTT. K-means clustering and the ranking from MCDM methods show that SCSBTT, Shine & Lal and Ravanbakhsh-F4 formula ensures higher performance among all formulae. The discriminant power of some MLAs and formulae was found considerably lower than that reported in original studies. Conclusion Comparative information on MLAs can aid researchers in developing new discriminating formulae that simultaneously ensure higher sensitivity and specificity. More multi-centric verification of the formulae on heterogeneous data is indispensable. SCSBTT and Shine & Lal formula, and ELM and GBC are recommended for screening BTT based on MCDM. SCSBTT can be used with certainty as a tangible cost-saving screening tool for mass screening for antenatal women in India and other countries.

Transfer learning for the generalization of artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection: a case-control study,"Africano, Gerson; Arponen, Otso; Rinta-Kiikka, Irina; Pertuz, Said","Background: Some researchers have questioned whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems maintain their performance when used for women from populations not considered during the development of the system. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of transfer learning as a way of improving the generalization of AI systems in the detection of breast cancer. Material and Methods: This retrospective case-control Finnish study involved 191 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 191 matched healthy controls. We selected a state-of-the-art AI system for breast cancer detection trained using a large US dataset. The selected baseline system was evaluated in two experimental settings. First, we examined our private Finnish sample as an independent test set that had not been considered in the development of the system (unseen population). Second, the baseline system was retrained to attempt to improve its performance in the unseen population by means of transfer learning. To analyze performance, we used areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong's test. Results: Two versions of the baseline system were considered: ImageOnly and Heatmaps. The ImageOnly and Heatmaps versions yielded mean AUC values of 0.82Â±0.008 and 0.88Â±0.003 in the US dataset and 0.56 (95% CI=0.50â0.62) and 0.72 (95% CI=0.67â0.77) when evaluated in the unseen population, respectively. The retrained systems achieved AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI=0.55â0.66) and 0.69 (95% CI=0.64â0.75), respectively. There was no statistical difference between the baseline system and the retrained system. Conclusion: Transfer learning with a small study sample did not yield a significant improvement in the generalization of the system.

Understanding latent affective bias in large pre-trained neural language models,"Kadan, A.; P., D.; Bhadra, S.; P. Gangan, M.; V.l., L.","Groundbreaking inventions and highly significant performance improvements in deep learning based Natural Language Processing are witnessed through the development of transformer based large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The wide availability of unlabeled data within human generated data deluge along with self-supervised learning strategy helps to accelerate the success of large PLMs in language generation, language understanding, etc. But at the same time, latent historical bias/unfairness in human minds towards a particular gender, race, etc., encoded unintentionally/intentionally into the corpora harms and questions the utility and efficacy of large PLMs in many real-world applications, particularly for the protected groups. In this paper, we present an extensive investigation towards understanding the existence of ""Affective Bias"" in large PLMs to unveil any biased association of emotions such as anger, fear, joy, etc., towards a particular gender, race or religion with respect to the downstream task of textual emotion detection. We conduct our exploration of affective bias from the very initial stage of corpus level affective bias analysis by searching for imbalanced distribution of affective words within a domain, in large scale corpora that are used to pre-train and fine-tune PLMs. Later, to quantify affective bias in model predictions, we perform an extensive set of class-based and intensity-based evaluations using various bias evaluation corpora. Our results show the existence of statistically significant affective bias in the PLM based emotion detection systems, indicating biased association of certain emotions towards a particular gender, race, and religion.

Evaluation of mental workload in haptic-enabled virtual assembly training operations,"Macias-Velasquez, S.; Medellin-Castillo, H.I.; Garcia-Barrientos, A.","The use of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the industry has considerably increased in the last years aiming to digitalize, simulate, and optimize processes. However, although the industrial integration of VR has several technical benefits, it may deviate from real-world demands, potentially outperforming human capabilities. In industrial VR research, there is still a lack of awareness of human aspects, and technical aspects are prioritized over user needs. Consequently, large research gaps about the effect of VR systems on the human factor need to be filled in order to know and enhance the user's well-being and experience. Hence, this research aims to investigate the effect of operating a haptic-enabled VR system for industrial assembly training on the mental workload experienced by new users. A random sample of ninety participants was selected to carry out virtual assembly training. Three sets of training durations were selected and evaluated separately: 1, 2, and 3 h. The mental workload was assessed in each of these training durations. The results have demonstrated that the training duration has a small effect on the workload experienced by new users during their first virtual assembly training. In addition, although the workload levels are not very high, females and males experience different workload levels. The research findings fill some of the existing research gaps and can be useful in promoting the long-term mental well-being of workers when implementing VR technologies in the industry.",2024,/,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,132,11-12,5395-5406,,10.1007/s00170-024-13691-9,,#680,Macias-Velasquez 2024,"",""

This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18-72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36% female, 29% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3%-88.8%) and NPV was 98.3% (90.6%-100%). For the 31.8% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4% (91.6%-100%) and specificity was 78.9% (67.6%-87.7%). The Device's indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6% (63/122) (95% CI 42.4%, 60.8%), and specificity would fall to 18.5% (56/303) (95% CI 14.3%, 23.3%).

"Sex differences in torque steadiness, accuracy and activation of the shoulder girdle muscles during isometric shoulder scaption","Zancanaro, L.L.; Cid, M.M.; Cote, J.N.; Oliveira, A.B.","Females present more neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders and have different activation strategies of the shoulder girdle muscles than males. However, the sensorimotor performance and potential sex differences are still largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in torque steadiness and accuracy during isometric shoulder scaption. We also examined the amplitude and variability of the activation of the trapezius, serratus anterior (SA), and anterior deltoid muscles during torque output evaluation. Thirty-four asymptomatic adults (17 females) participated. Torque steadiness and accuracy were evaluated during submaximal contractions at 20 % and 35 % of peak torque (PT). There was no sex difference in torque coefficient of variation, but females had significantly lower torque standard deviation (SD) values than males at the two intensities evaluated (p < 0.001) and lower torque median frequency values compared to males, regardless of intensity (p < 0.01). Females had significantly lower absolute error values than males for torque output at 35 %PT (p < 0.01) and lower constant error values compared to males, regardless of intensity (p = 0.01). Females had significantly higher muscle amplitude values than males, except for SA (p = 0.10) and in general, females showed higher muscle activation SD values compared to males (p < 0.05). Females may require more complex muscle activation patterns to achieve a more stable and accurate torque output. Therefore, these sex differences may reflect control mechanisms that may also be at play when explaining the greater risk of neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders in females than males.

A novel machine learning approach for evaluation of public policies: an application in relation to the performance of university researchers,"Ballestar, M.T.; Doncel, L.M.; Sainz, J.; Ortigosa-Blanch, A.","Research has become the main reference point for academic life in modern universities. Research incentives have been a controversial issue, because of the difficulty of identifying who are the main beneficiaries and what are the long-term effects. Still, new policies including financial incentives have been adopted to increase the research output at all possible levels. Little literature has been devoted to the response to those incentives. To bridge this gap, we carry out our analysis with data of a six years program developed in Madrid (Spain). Instead of using a traditional econometric approach, we design a machine learning multilevel model to discover on whom, when, and for how long those policies have an effect. The empirical model consists of an automated nested longitudinal clustering (ANLC) performed in two stages. Firstly, it performs a stratification of academics, and secondly, it performs a longitudinal segmentation for each group. The second part considers the researchersâ sociodemographic, academic information and the evolution of their performance over time in the form of the annual percentage variation of their marks over the period. The new methodology, whose robustness is tested with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm, shows that tenure track researchers present a better response to incentives than tenured researches, and also that gender plays an important role in academia. These discoveries are relevant to administrations and universities for understanding the productivity of academics working under long-term incentive-based programs, the drawbacks and the inequalities for maximizing the generation of knowledge.

FDA-approved machine learning algorithms in neuroradiology: A systematic review of the current evidence for approval,"Yearley, Alexander G.; Goedmakers, Caroline M.W.; Panahi, Armon; Doucette, Joanne; Rana, Aakanksha; Ranganathan, Kavitha; Smith, Timothy R.","Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly prevalent in the medical field. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating AI algorithms as ""medical devices"" to ensure patient safety. However, recent work has shown that the FDA approval process may be deficient. In this study, we evaluate the evidence supporting FDA-approved neuroalgorithms, the subset of machine learning algorithms with applications in the central nervous system (CNS), through a systematic review of the primary literature. Articles covering the 53 FDA-approved algorithms with applications in the CNS published in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Scopus between database inception and January 25, 2022 were queried. Initial searches identified 1505 studies, of which 92 articles met the criteria for extraction and inclusion. Studies were identified for 26 of the 53 neuroalgorithms, of which 10 algorithms had only a single peer-reviewed publication. Performance metrics were available for 15 algorithms, external validation studies were available for 24 algorithms, and studies exploring the use of algorithms in clinical practice were available for 7 algorithms. Papers studying the clinical utility of these algorithms focused on three domains: workflow efficiency, cost savings, and clinical outcomes. Our analysis suggests that there is a meaningful gap between the FDA approval of machine learning algorithms and their clinical utilization. There appears to be room for process improvement by implementation of the following recommendations: the provision of compelling evidence that algorithms perform as intended, mandating minimum sample sizes, reporting of a predefined set of performance metrics for all algorithms and clinical application of algorithms prior to widespread use.

Evaluating Machine Learning Methods of Analyzing Multiclass Metabolomics,"Gong, Yaguo; Ding, Wei; Wang, Panpan; Wu, Qibiao; Yao, Xiaojun; Yang, Qingxia","Multiclass metabolomic studies have become popular for revealing the differences in multiple stages of complex diseases, various lifestyles, or the effects of specific treatments. In multiclass metabolomics, there are multiple data manipulation steps for analyzing raw data, which consist of data filtering, the imputation of missing values, data normalization, marker identification, sample separation, classification, and so on. In each step, several to dozens of machine learning methods can be chosen for the given data set, with potentially hundreds or thousands of method combinations in the whole data processing chain. Therefore, a clear understanding of these machine learning methods is helpful for selecting an appropriate method combination for obtaining stable and reliable analytical results of specific data. However, there has rarely been an overall introduction or evaluation of these methods based on multiclass metabolomic data. Herein, detailed descriptions of these machine learning methods in multiple data manipulation steps are reviewed. Moreover, an assessment of these methods was performed using a benchmark data set for multiclass metabolomics. First, 12 imputation methods for imputing missing values were evaluated based on the PSS (Procrustes statistical shape analysis) and NRMSE (normalized root-mean-square error) values. Second, 17 normalization methods for processing multiclass metabolomic data were evaluated by applying the PMAD (pooled median absolute deviation) value. Third, different methods of identifying markers of multiclass metabolomics were evaluated based on the CWrel (relative weighted consistency) value. Fourth, nine classification methods for constructing multiclass models were assessed using the AUC (area under the curve) value. Performance evaluations of machine learning methods are highly recommended to select the most appropriate method combination before performing the final analysis of the given data.

"Artificial intelligence-enabled environmental sustainability of products: Marketing benefits and their variation by consumer, location, and product types","Frank, Bjorn","Firms are developing AI-enhanced products (e.g., robots) that can tackle environmental problems through autonomous interactions with their surroundings (e.g., removing waste/pollutants, tracking invasive species) and autonomous learning, which results in improved environmental performance characteristics. Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being.

Synergy of carbohydrate and caffeine ingestion on physical performance and metabolic responses to exercise: A systematic review with meta-analysis,"Lopez-Seoane, Jaime; Buitrago-Morales, Marta; Jimenez, Sergio L.; Del Coso, Juan; Pareja-Galeano, Helios","Carbohydrates (CHO) and caffeine (CAF) are two ergogenic aids commonly used among athletes to enhance performance. However, there is some controversy as to whether the concurrent intake of both supplements might result in an additive and synergistic improvement in exercise performance. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of adding CAF to a protocol of CHO ingestion, compared with the intake of each ergogenic aid alone and with placebo, on exercise performance and metabolic responses in healthy young physically active adults. This study was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The PubMed, Web of Science, Medline Complete, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and CENTRAL databases were searched including randomized controlled trials (RCT) that were at least single blind. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool 2. Meta-analysis were performed on performance variables and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the random-effects model. Thirteen RCT with 128 participants (117 men and 11 women) were included in this study. The ingestion of CAF and CHO reduced sprint time during repeated sprint protocols in comparison with CHO isolated ingestion (SMD: â0.45; 95% CI: â0.85, â0.05) while there was a tendency for a reduction in the time employed during time trials (SMD: â0.36; 95% CI: â0.77, 0.05). The RPE tended to be lower with CAF and CHO compared with CHO isolated ingestion during steady-state exercise (SMD: â0.43; 95% CI: â0.91, 0.05) with no differences between conditions in performance trials (SMD: â0.05, 95% CI: â0.39, 0.29). Although most of the studies showed higher values of blood glucose when CHO was co-ingested with CAF compared with PLA, only two studies observed higher values with CHO and CAF co-ingestion with respect to the isolated intake of CHO. One study observed greater fat oxidation and lower glycogen use when CAF was added to CHO. In terms of cortisol levels, one study showed an increase in cortisol levels when CAF was co-ingested with CHO compared with PLA. In summary, concurrent CHO and CAF intake may produce an additive ergogenic effect respect of the isolated ingestion of CHO. This additive effect was present when CHO was provided by a 6â9% of CHO solution (maltodextrin/dextrin + fructose) and CAF is administered in a dose of 4â6.5 mg/kg.

Student Performance Patterns in Engineering at the University of Johannesburg: An Exploratory Data Analysis,"Maphosa, Mfowabo; Doorsamy, Wesley; Paul, Babu S.","Globally, the increased demand for engineers is not matched by an increase in graduates. This is further exacerbated by the fact that student dropout rates in engineering are higher than in other disciplines. Understanding engineering students' performance patterns and potential influences can lead to developing interventions to improve engineering students' success. Recent advances in data science and educational data mining have made it possible to extract valuable information from historical data, which can supplement interventions. This study sought to extract insights and information from real-world data, analyse correlations in the dataset's variables and better understand the influences of student performance. Exploratory data analysis was applied to the dataset to visualise the dataset and infer the correlations between variables provided in the dataset on student performance patterns. We used Python for data analysis and visualising the correlation between variables. The results show gender disparity in engineering enrollments, with only a quarter of female students enrolled. The study also indicates that the completion rates could be much higher. Another finding is that most students who drop out do so because of choosing the wrong qualifications. Furthermore, when comparing the percentages, female students performed slightly better than their male counterparts. The correlation analysis shows no relationships between gender, race, admission point score, mathematics marks and science marks with student performance in engineering. Understanding student performance patterns can reduce dropout rates by correctly advising students to enrol on the most suitable programmes, and aid support interventions are needed to improve student success in engineering.

Motion Technologies in Support of Fence Athletes: A Systematic Review,"Aresta, S.; Musci, M.; Bottiglione, F.; Moretti, L.; Moretti, B.; Bortone, I.","Sports biomechanics enables thorough examination of athletic movements to enhance athletic performance and/or reduce injury risk. Few studies have looked at the possibilities of cutting-edge technology in fencing, even though it presents an intriguing scenario for sports biomechanics due to the significant demands it places on the body in terms of neuromuscular coordination, strength, power, and musculoskeletal system impact. The aim of the study is to identify and summarise current evidence on the application of motion technologies in support of fence athletes and to provide a framework for the assessment and training of fencers, including performance measures and protocols. Peer-reviewed research was identified from electronic databases using a structured keyword search. Details regarding experimental design, study group characteristics, and measured outcomes were extracted from retrieved studies, summarised, and information regrouped under themes for analysis. The methodological quality of the evidence was evaluated. Thirty-five studies were included in the present review, which showed kinetic, kinematic, muscle recruitment and coordination differences among athletes as gender and athletic training differed. Findings revealed that most of the included studies investigated the lunge technique in professional athletes using Optoelectronic Systems and force platforms as preferred motion technologies. Only nine studies reported the assessment of muscle activation during task execution (25.7%). Less than 20% of the study recurred to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches in the analysis. The potential contribution of the user's kinematic/kinetic data and physiological measures is still underestimated.

Semisupervised transfer learning for evaluation of model classification performance,"Wang, Linshanshan; Wang, Xuan; Liao, Katherine P.; Cai, Tianxi","In many modern machine learning applications, changes in covariate distributions and difficulty in acquiring outcome information have posed challenges to robust model training and evaluation. Numerous transfer learning methods have been developed to robustly adapt the model itself to some unlabeled target populations using existing labeled data in a source population. However, there is a paucity of literature on transferring performance metrics, especially receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters, of a trained model. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of a trained binary classifier on unlabeled target population based on ROC analysis. We proposed Semisupervised Transfer lEarning of Accuracy Measures (STEAM), an efficient three-step estimation procedure that employs (1) double-index modeling to construct calibrated density ratio weights and (2) robust imputation to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data to improve estimation efficiency. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under the correct specification of either the density ratio model or the outcome model. We also correct for potential overfitting bias in the estimators in finite samples with cross-validation. We compare our proposed estimators to existing methods and show reductions in bias and gains in efficiency through simulations. We illustrate the practical utility of the proposed method on evaluating prediction performance of a phenotyping model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a temporally evolving EHR cohort.

Debiasing Education Algorithms,"Idowu, Jamiu Adekunle","This systematic literature review investigates the fairness of machine learning algorithms in educational settings, focusing on recent studies and their proposed solutions to address biases. Applications analyzed include student dropout prediction, performance prediction, forum post classification, and recommender systems. We identify common strategies, such as adjusting sample weights, bias attenuation methods, fairness through un/awareness, and adversarial learning. Commonly used metrics for fairness assessment include ABROCA, group difference in performance, and disparity metrics. The review underscores the need for context-specific approaches to ensure equitable treatment and reveals that most studies found no strict tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. We recommend evaluating fairness of data and features before algorithmic fairness to prevent algorithms from receiving discriminatory inputs, expanding the scope of education fairness studies beyond gender and race to include other demographic attributes, and assessing the impact of fair algorithms on end users, as human perceptions may not align with algorithmic fairness measures.

Performance Evaluation of Newly Developed Generalized Correlations for the Prediction of Solar Diffuse Fraction for Various Climatic Regions,"Sumair, Muhammad; Aized, Tauseef; Bhutta, Muhammad Mahmood Aslam; Tehreem, Layba; Shoaib, Muhammad","The objective of this work is to develop empirical correlations describing diffuse fraction (DF) as a function of (1) sunshine fraction (SF), (2) clearness index (CI), and (3) both SF and CI. Four years instantaneously measured data were changed to monthly data at five locations belonging to five different climatic regions in Pakistan which were used as training dataset and nine correlations for each location (a total of 45) were formulated and their performance was assessed. Moreover, nine general empirical models were developed using the entire dataset (11 years) for five locations which were termed as generalized correlations (GCs). These GCs were validated by applying them to five other locations and comparing the generated results with measured results for those locations (validation dataset). The best model among GCs was found as GC8 which was then applied to compute DF for five more locations for which short-term (8 months) measured data were also available and thus a reasonable comparison could be made. Results showed that (1) new models were better than literature models, (2) GCs correlations were found in good agreement, and (3) second-degree multi-variate polynomial models are the best performance models with minimum errors, e.g., mean absolute biased error (MABE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), sum of square of relative error (SSRE), and relative standard error (RSE) for GC8 were estimated as 0.018, 6.397, 0.021, 0.006, and 0.022, respectively (all values for Karachi).

The effect of moderate broadband noise on cognitive performance: a systematic review,"Zhou, H.; Molesworth, B.R.C.; Burgess, M.; Hatfield, J.","Individuals in occupational settings are often exposed to moderate levels (e.g., < 85 dBA) of background noise (i.e., broadband noise) while performing cognitive-based tasks.

Performance evaluation of DFT based speckle reduction framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images at different frequencies and image regions,"Jain, V.; Shitole, S.; Rahman, M.","Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are widely used for remote sensing and geoscience applications. However, the coherent processing of radar signals in PolSAR imaging leads to the presence of speckle noise, which can significantly degrade image quality and limit the accuracy of subsequent analyses. To address this issue, speckle reduction frameworks are often applied to PolSAR images to reduce the noise level and enhance image quality. In this paper, the performance of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based speckle reduction framework is evaluated on different bands (L, C, and P band) against various evaluation metrics like CV, SD, SNR, ENL, SSI and SMPI. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing filtered and unfiltered images across different parameters, such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, equivalent number of looks (ENL), variance, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on all three bands for the diagonal elements (T11, T22, and T33) of T3 matrix. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework's ability to (i) smoothen homogeneous regions, (ii) preserve contours, and (iii) retain polarimetric information. The framework's ability to reduce speckle noise and improve image quality is demonstrated through a significant reduction in standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and improvement in SNR and ENL values. The proposed framework successfully preserved polarimetric information while effectively suppressing speckle noise. These results suggest that the proposed framework could be a valuable tool for improving PolSAR image quality and enhancing subsequent processing of PolSAR data.

Multi-Group Fairness Evaluation via Conditional Value-at-Risk Testing,"Monteiro Paes, L.; Suresh, A.T.; Beutel, A.; Calmon, F.P.; Beirami, A.","Machine learning (ML) models used in prediction and classification tasks may display performance disparities across population groups determined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex, age). We consider the problem of evaluating the performance of a fixed ML model across population groups defined by multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., race and sex and age). Here, the sample complexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g., the largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number of group-denoting sensitive attributes. To address this issue, we propose an approach to test for performance disparities based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a model has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity required for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be at most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a byproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior distribution, we show that ReÌnyi entropy of order 2/3 of the prior distribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test algorithm. Finally, we also show that there exists a non-i.i.d. data collection strategy that results in a sample complexity independent of the number of groups.",2024,/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory,5,,659-74,,10.1109/JSAIT.2024.3397741,,#706,MonteiroPaes 2024,"",""

For the domain Verbal Functions and Language Skills, subclass Verbal Expression, a meta-analysis was not possible because one of the two included studies did not provide numerical values. Results of both studies did not indicate statistically significant effects of RF-EMF exposure on both speed and accuracy. For the domain Construction and Motor Performance, subclass Motor Skills RF-EMF exposure may reduce speed, but the evidence is very uncertain (Hedges's g â0.919, 95 % CI [â3.09; 1.26], I2 = 96 %, 42 participants); it probably results in little to no difference in accuracy and does not reduce accuracy (Hedges's g 0.228, 95 % CI [â0.01; 0.46], I2 = 0 %, 109 participants).

For the domain Concept Formation and Reasoning, subclass Mathematical Procedures RF-EMF exposure results in little to no difference in speed (Hedges's g 0.033, 95 % CI [â0.12; 0.18], I2 = 0 %, 168 participants) and may result in little to no difference in accuracy but probably does not reduce accuracy (Hedges's g 0.232, 95 % CI [â0.12; +0.59], I2 = 86 %, 253 participants). For the domain Executive Functions there were no studies. Discussion: Overall, the results from all domains and subclasses across their speed- and accuracy-related outcome measures according to GRADE provide high to low certainty of evidence that short-term RF-EMF exposure does not reduce cognitive performance in human experimental studies. For 16 out of 35 subdomains some uncertainty remains, because of limitations in the study quality, inconsistency in the results or imprecision of the combined effect size estimate.

Internal and External Load Profile during Beach Invasion Sports Match-Play by Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems: A Systematic Review,"Vaccaro-Benet, P.; Gomez-Carmona, C.D.; Marzano-Felisatti, J.M.; Pino-Ortega, J.","Beach variants of popular sports like soccer and handball have grown in participation over the last decade. However, the characterization of the workload demands in beach sports remains limited compared to their indoor equivalents. This systematic review aimed to: (1) characterize internal and external loads during beach invasion sports match-play; (2) identify technologies and metrics used for monitoring; (3) compare the demands of indoor sports; and (4) explore differences by competition level, age, sex, and beach sport. Fifteen studies ultimately met the inclusion criteria. The locomotive volumes averaged 929 Â± 269 m (average) and 16.5 Â± 3.3 km/h (peak) alongside 368 Â± 103 accelerations and 8 Â± 4 jumps per session. The impacts approached 700 per session. The heart rates reached 166-192 beats per minute (maximal) eliciting 60-95% intensity. The player load was 12.5 Â± 2.9 to 125 Â± 30 units. Males showed 10-15% higher external but equivalent internal loads versus females. Earlier studies relied solely on a time-motion analysis, while recent works integrate electronic performance and tracking systems, enabling a more holistic quantification. However, substantial metric intensity zone variability persists. Beach sports entail intermittent high-intensity activity with a lower-intensity recovery. Unstable surface likely explains the heightened internal strain despite moderately lower running volumes than indoor sports. The continued integration of technology together with the standardization of workload intensity zones is needed to inform a beach-specific training prescription.",2024,/,Sensors,24,12,3738 (20 pp.),,10.3390/s24123738,,#709,Vaccaro-Benet 2024,"",""
FACES: A Deep-Learning-Based Parametric Model to Improve Rosacea Diagnoses,"Seungman Park; Chien, A.L.; Beiyu Lin; Keva Li","Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that causes visible blood vessels and redness on the nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead. However, visual assessment, the current standard method used to identify rosacea, is often subjective among clinicians and results in high variation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have allowed for the effective detection of various skin diseases with high accuracy and consistency. In this study, we develop a new methodology, coined ""five accurate CNNs-based evaluation system (FACES)"", to identify and classify rosacea more efficiently. First, 19 CNN-based models that have been widely used for image classification were trained and tested via training and validation data sets. Next, the five best performing models were selected based on accuracy, which served as a weight value for FACES. At the same time, we also applied a majority rule to five selected models to detect rosacea. The results exhibited that the performance of FACES was superior to that of the five individual CNN-based models and the majority rule in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. In particular, the accuracy and sensitivity of FACES were the highest, and the specificity and precision were higher than most of the individual models. To improve the performance of our system, future studies must consider patient details, such as age, gender, and race, and perform comparison tests between our model system and clinicians.",2023,/,Applied Sciences,,,970 (12 pp.),,10.3390/app13020970,,#711,SeungmanPark 2023,"",""
Associations between muscle myotonometry (a)symmetry and functional movement performance in young women and men,"Radziunas, K.; Radziuniene, M.; Vainoras, A.; Poderys, J.","Asymmetry of body parts refers to absence of symmetry and unevenly developed body parts in terms of the axis and plane. It has been long ago noticed that no perfectly correct human body exists, and bodies are to a greater or lesser extent asymmetric. A passive way of life, insufficient movement and inappropriate ergonomics of the workplace have a negative impact on the skeletal muscle system, usually resulting in reduced muscle power, static and dynamic muscle endurance, and altered muscle tone. The aim is to determine whether muscle myotonometry parameters are informative in early risk diagnostics to predict the likelihood of skeletal muscle system trauma. The study involved 382 people aged 18-24. Participants were devided into two groups: according to the accumulated composite score. Testing was made one time. The study consisted of functional movement and myotonometry evaluation. The study analyses and presents comparisons of the results depending on the trauma likelihood and sex. In addition, asymmetry of the left and the right body side is investigated. The analysis of the asymmetries (delta) in the frequency of damped oscillations of trapezius, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius (inner and outer part) on the left and right sides of the body demonstrated greater asymmetries between the left and the right sides of the body in the groups of both men and women with a lower chance of trauma. The assessment of asymmetries in femoris rectus and tibialis anterior between the left and the right sides of the body showed differences in the frequency of damped oscillations in all groups. Muscle myotonometry parameters are informative and may be used in early risk diagnostics to predict skeletal muscle system trauma. The asymmetry in tibialis muscle tone between the left and the right leg causes poorer parameters of functional movement performance in women. No associations were found to exist with the ability to perform functional movements in men. The asymmetry in femoris muscle tone between the left and right leg demonstrates the ability of young subjects to perform functional movements. It is characteristic of men and, to a lower extent, of women.",2018,03/,Journal of Measurements in Engineering,6,1,53-63,,10.21595/jme.2018.19686,,#712,Radziunas 2018,"",""

Performance evaluation of a multi-functional personalized environmental control system (PECS) prototype,"Shinoda, Jun; Bogatu, Dragos-Ioan; Watanabe, Futa; Kaneko, Yosuke; Olesen, Bjarne W.; Kazanci, Ongun B.","A prototype of a multifunctional, stand-alone Personalized Environmental Control System (PECS) was developed and evaluated. The prototype comprised an electric heating panel and an air terminal device (ATD) for supplying air cleaned by a filter and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. A Peltier element was installed in the ATD for cooling the supply air. Experiments were conducted in a climate chamber to evaluate the performance of the prototype. Thermal manikin measurements were conducted to quantify the heating and cooling effects of the PECS. Tracer gas measurements using nitrous oxide with a breathing thermal manikin were conducted to evaluate the air distribution performance of the ATD. A human subject experiment was conducted with 24 university students (12 male and 12 female) at 18â28 Â°C room temperatures. The whole body heating and cooling effects of the PECS, in manikin-based equivalent temperature differences, were up to 1.3 K and 0.3 K, respectively. The ventilation effectiveness of the ATD was up to 1.4. The prototype was able to increase thermal acceptability at all tested temperatures for female subjects. For the male subjects, the thermal acceptability decreased with PECS at 28 Â°C, possibly due to their cooling expectations not being met. The Peltier element did not provide a noticeable cooling enhancement despite its high power use. The noise generated by the ATD fan and the smell of the ATD supply air acted as factors limiting the use of PECS. A holistic assessment of the IEQ factors and ergonomic factors is important for future development of PECS.

Evaluation on the performance of quilts based on young people's sleep quality and thermal comfort in winter,"He, Manchen; Lian, Zhiwei; Chen, Pin","This study evaluated the performance of three different quilts (white duck down quilt, white goose down quilt and cotton quilt) based on sleep quality and thermal comfort of young people in non-heating bedroom in winter. Thermal comfort and sleep quality were subjectively evaluated before and after sleep. Electroencephalograms (EEG), skin temperatures and bed climate were measured throughout the all-night sleep. Both subjective and physiological results showed that quilt materials had a significant effect on sleep quality and thermal comfort. The goose down quilt was evaluated the most comfortable in overall sleep comfort and sleep thermal sensation. The duration of slow wave sleep as calculated by EEG signal was longer, the skin temperatures and bed climate were higher when the goose down quilt was used. The results also show that there are gender differences in skin temperatures. Compared with males, the mean skin temperature (MST) of females was higher, while their foot temperature was significantly lower, which suggest that for females more attention should be paid to maintain warmth of extremity during sleep in winter. Our results suggest that sleep quality and thermal comfort is the most desirable when using goose down quilt and undesirable when using cotton quilt. Duvet could guarantee a comfortable bed climate in non-heating bedroom in winter of East China. Results also showed that lighter quilts would have a higher degree of satisfactions, indicating that young people in East China may have a preference for light quilt.

Excess fluoride in drinking water above the maximum contaminant level (e.g., the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 1.5 mg/L) also affects the skeletal and nervous systems of humans. Fluoride removal from aqueous solutions is difficult using conventional electrochemical, precipitation, and adsorption methods owing to its ionic size and reactivity. Thus, new technologies have been introduced to reduce the fluoride concentration in industrial wastewater effluents and various drinking water sources. Membrane technology is one of the newer technologies found to be very effective in significantly reducing fluoride to desired standards levels; however, it has received less attention than other technologies because it is perceived as a costly process. This study critically reviewed the performance of various membrane process and compared it with effluent and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) standards. The performance review has been conducted with the consideration of the theoretical background, rejection mechanisms, technical viability, and parameters affecting flux and rejection performance. This review includes membrane systems investigated for the defluoridation process but operated under pressure (i.e., reverse osmosis [RO] and nanofiltration [NF]), temperature gradients (i.e., membrane distillation [MD]), electrical potential gradients (i.e., electrodialysis [ED] and Donnan dialysis [DD]), and concentration differences (i.e., forward osmosis [FO]). Moreover, the study also addressed the advantages, limitations, & applicable conditions of each membrane based defluoridation process.

Deep Learning in Virtual Try-On: A Comprehensive Survey,"Islam, T.; Miron, A.; Liu, X.; Li, Y.","Virtual try-on technology has gained significant importance in the retail industry due to its potential to transform the way customers interact with products and make purchase decisions. It allows users to virtually try on clothing and accessories, providing a realistic representation of how the items would look and fit without the need for physical interaction. The ability to virtually try on products addresses common challenges associated with online shopping, such as uncertainty about fit and style, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience and satisfaction. As a result, virtual try-on technology has the potential to reduce returns and optimise conversion rates for businesses, making it a valuable tool in the e-commerce landscape. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning based virtual try-on models, focusing on their functionality, technical details, dataset usage, weaknesses, and impact on customer satisfaction. The models are categorised into three main types: image-based, multi-pose, and video virtual try-on models, with detailed examples and technical summaries provided for each category. Additionally, we identify and discuss similarities and differences in these methods. Furthermore, we examine the datasets currently available for building and evaluating virtual try-on models, including the number of images/videos and their resolutions. We present the commonly used methods for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing synthesised images with previous work and performing quantitative evaluations across various metrics and benchmark datasets. We discuss the weaknesses of current deep learning based virtual try-on models, including challenges in preserving clothing characteristics and textures, the level of accuracy of applying the clothing to the person, and the preservation of facial identities. Additionally, we address dataset bias, particularly the domination of female models, limited diversity in clothing featured, and relatively simple and clean backgrounds in the datasets, which can negatively impact the model's ability to handle challenging situations. Moreover, we explore the impact of virtual try-ons on customer satisfaction, highlighting the benefits that customers can enjoy, which also reduces returns and optimises conversion rates for businesses.",2024,/,IEEE Access,12,,29475-29502,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3368612,,#721,Islam 2024,"",""

Exploring the gender gap in the conceptual survey of electricity and magnetism,"Henderson, R.; Stewart, G.; Stewart, J.; Michaluk, L.; Traxler, A.","The âgender gapâ on various physics conceptual evaluations has been extensively studied. Menâs average pretest scores on the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are 13% higher than womenâs, and post-test scores are on average 12% higher than womenâs. This study analyzed the gender differences within the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) in which the gender gap has been less well studied and is less consistent. In the current study, data collected from 1407 students (77% men, 23% women) in a calculus-based physics course over ten semesters showed that male students outperformed female students on the CSEM pretest (5%) and post-test (6%). Separate analyses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative problems on lab quizzes and course exams and showed that male students outperformed female students by 3% on qualitative quiz and exam problems. Male and female students performed equally on the quantitative course exam problems. The gender gaps within CSEM post-test scores, qualitative lab quiz scores, and qualitative exam scores were insignificant for students with a CSEM pretest score of 25% or less but grew as pretest scores increased. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that a latent variable, called Conceptual Physics Performance/Non-Quantitative (CPP/NonQnt), orthogonal to quantitative test performance was useful in explaining the differences observed in qualitative performance; this variable was most strongly related to CSEM post-test scores. The CPP/NonQnt of male students was 0.44 standard deviations higher than female students. The CSEM pretest measured CPP/NonQnt much less accurately for women (R2=4%) than for men (R2=17%). The failure to detect a gender gap for students scoring 25% or less on the pretest suggests that the CSEM instrument itself is not gender biased. The failure to find a performance difference in quantitative test performance while detecting a gap in qualitative performance suggests the qualitative differences do not result from psychological factors such as science anxiety or stereotype threat.",2017,07/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,13,2,020114 (17 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020114,,#724,Henderson 2017,"",""
Malicious insider threat detection using variation of sampling methods for anomaly detection in cloud environment,"S, Asha; D, Shanmugapriya; G, Padmavathi","Machine learning (ML) techniques have currently been exploited for malicious insider threat (MIT) detection. The data variation between malicious and genuine user influences the ML model to misinterpret a malicious insider. Hence, the class imbalance problem (CIP) remains a challenging one. Regardless of the CIP in MIT detection, past research has a significant shortfall in deploying diverse sampling methods. i.e., undersampling and oversampling approach. This study proposed a novel double-layer architecture for MIT detection. The initial layer involves integration, transformation, and sampling system of data. In the sampling system, an efficient sampling approach is adopted to depreciate CIP among eight sampling techniques, depending on the performance of support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Nearmiss2 (NM-2) excels and is considered an optimal sampling technique. In the second layer, sampled data of NM-2 is employed in an anomalous MIT detection model using various anomaly detection techniques and evaluated with performance metrics. The main focus is to validate the solution for CIP in anomaly detection techniques with previous research.

Performance of First-Trimester Fetal Echocardiography in Diagnosing Fetal Heart Defects: Meta-analysis and Systematic Review,"Yu, Dongmei; Sui, Lun; Zhang, Nan","Objectives: Early fetal echocardiography is becoming increasing common during the nuchal translucency scan period. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of first-trimester fetal echocardiography in diagnosing congenital heart defects (CHDs). Methods: The databases of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were systematically searched for the candidate articles, and the references of included studies were also examined. We recorded the characteristics of the included studies and assessed the quality of each study by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated with Meta-Disc version 1.4 software (RamÃ³n y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain). We also evaluated the publication bias by using Stata version 12.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results: This meta-analysis included 18 studies with 26,201 fetal hearts. The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, and NLR were 0.750, 0.999, 392.95, and 0.277, respectively. The DOR and AUC were 1736.0 and 0.9331. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC for major CHDs were 0.838, 1.000, 725.69, 0.203, 5084.8, and 0.9617.

Prediction of fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination using ensemble learning,"Lu, Yu; Fu, Xianghua; Chen, Fangxiong; Wong, Kelvin K.L.","Obstetric ultrasound examination of physiological parameters has been mainly used to estimate the fetal weight during pregnancy and baby weight before labour to monitor fetal growth and reduce prenatal morbidity and mortality. However, the problem is that ultrasound estimation of fetal weight is subject to population's difference, strict operating requirements for sonographers, and poor access to ultrasound in low-resource areas. Inaccurate estimations may lead to negative perinatal outcomes. This study aims to predict fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination within a certain accuracy. We consider that machine learning can provide an accurate estimation for obstetricians alongside traditional clinical practices, as well as an efficient and effective support tool for pregnant women for self-monitoring. We present a robust methodology using a data set comprising 4212 intrapartum recordings. The cubic spline function is used to fit the curves of several key characteristics that are extracted from ultrasound reports. A number of simple and powerful machine learning algorithms are trained, and their performance is evaluated with real test data. We also propose a novel evaluation performance index called the intersection-over-union (loU) for our study. The results are encouraging using an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms. The experimental results show the loU between predicted range of fetal weight at any gestational age that is given by the ensemble model and ultrasound respectively. The machine learning based approach applied in our study is able to predict, with a high accuracy, fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination.

A Performance Evaluation of the BIM-Based Object-Oriented Physical Modeling Technique for Building Thermal Simulations: A Comparative Case Study,WoonSeong Jeong; Kee Han Kim,"The development of separate building performance simulation tools has brought about a significant need for the integration of multi-domain simulations that would enable multiple building performance analyses to be conducted from a single building model. Insufficient data integration between the tools and Building Information Modeling (BIM) currently prevents the efficient production of comprehensive building performance analyses. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain simulation tool, effective and efficient data, and a process integration methodology are all required. Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) has emerged as a form of object-oriented modeling capable of supporting multiple domain simulations. Adoption of OOPM into building performance simulations with BIM is particularly interesting as a means of facilitating model translations between BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modeling). Specifically, complex data translation from the building topology in BIM to the space boundary conditions in BEM is both labor intensive and time consuming. This research uses case studies to investigate the feasibility of automatically translating a building topology from BIM to OOPM-based BEM. We included numerous preconditions in order to incorporate various object semantic differences into each model translation. Our research indicates that this adoption approach allows seamless model translations from BIM to OOPM-based BEM, which supports efficient and effective thermal simulations and facilitates the reuse of BIM data in multi-domain simulations.",2016,07/,Sustainability,8,7,648 (27 pp.),,10.3390/su8070648,,#732,WoonSeongJeong 2016,"",""
Promising energy-storage applications by flotation of graphite ores: A review,Ye Chen; Shilong Li; Shiru Lin; Mingzhe Chen; Cheng Tang; Xinghui Liu,"Graphite-based materials have attracted extensive attention due to their structure and excellent conductivity. Thus, the graphite-based ore industry has developed quickly. However, a complete industrial chain from raw materials, research and development (R & D), various types of applications, and commercial products have not yet been fully formed. To further accelerate the process of industrialization, optimizing the beneficiation process is necessary for improving the valuable minerals because of the difference in physical and chemical properties of the mineral. This review briefly introduces the standard beneficiation methods: gravity, magnetic, electric, and flotation separation. Specifically, we present a comprehensive process of the flotation method, including developing flotation reagents (collecting agent, foaming agent, inhibitor, activation agent, and pH regulators) and the revolutionary process of high-quality graphite flake. Finally, the representative energy storage application, including supercapacitors and batteries utilizing graphite-based materials, was discussed in the aspect of filtering alternating current, flexible, stretchable, transparent, and high-performance energy-storage devices. This review not only summarizes the high-quality graphite obtained from the graphite ore flotation method but also encourages graphite-based materials research and development in academia and industry, which has the potential to directly affect the industrialization process by lowering the manufacturing cost of post-treatment graphite.

"Quantitative approach to collaborative learning: Performance prediction, individual assessment, and group composition","Ling Cen; Ruta, D.; Powell, L.; Hirsch, B.; Ng, J.","The benefits of collaborative learning, although widely reported, lack the quantitative rigor and detailed insight into the dynamics of interactions within the group, while individual contributions and their impacts on group members and their collaborative work remain hidden behind joint group assessment. To bridge this gap we intend to address three important aspects of collaborative learning focused on quantitative evaluation and prediction of group performance. First, we use machine learning techniques to predict group performance based on the data of member interactions and thereby identify whether, and to what extent, the groupâs performance is driven by specific patterns of learning and interaction. Specifically, we explore the application of Extreme Learning Machine and Classification and Regression Trees to assess the predictability of group academic performance from live interaction data. Second, we propose a comparative model to unscramble individual student performances within the group. These performances are then used further in a generative mixture model of group grading as an explicit combination of isolated individual student grade expectations and compared against the actual group performances to define what we coined as collaboration synergy - directly measuring the improvements of collaborative learning. Finally the impact of group composition of gender and skills on learning performance and collaboration synergy is evaluated. The analysis indicates a high level of predictability of group performance based solely on the style and mechanics of collaboration and quantitatively supports the claim that heterogeneous groups with the diversity of skills and genders benefit more from collaborative learning than homogeneous groups.",2016,06/,International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning,11,2,187-225,,10.1007/s11412-016-9234-6,,#735,LingCen 2016,"",""

Performance-based testing for ICT skills assessing: a case study of students and teachersâ ICT skills in Finnish schools,"Kaarakainen, M.-T.; Kivinen, O.; Vainio, T.","Skills enabling and ensuring universal access to information have been investigated intensively during the past few years. The research results provide knowledge on the differences and digital divides. When examining ICT skill levels, the accuracy of assessment is one of the key issues to address the results and gain the applicable data for appropriate interventions to enhance digital inclusion. To date, ICT skill assessment is based mainly on self-reports and subjective evaluations. However, as previous studies have shown, people tend to overrate or underrate their own levels of competence. Thus, novel performance-based approach for assessing ICT skills is presented in this paper. The ICT skill test contains 42 tasks grouped into 17 ICT fields. The study was conducted with upper comprehensive and upper secondary level school students (n = 3159) and their teachers (n = 626) during years 2014â2016 in Finland. Using factor analysis, three ICT skills factors were created: basic digital skills, advanced technical skills, and professional ICT skills. The performance in the ICT skill test was also divided by gender, as the male students and teachers outperformed the female students and teacher. Outperformance also occurred by educational level, as both upper secondary level students and teachers were seen as possessing higher-level ICT skills than students and teachers at the comprehensive level. We thus argue that to compare the ICT skills and the validity of the assessments, we needed to ensure consistent assessment for both students and teachers. In addition, in order to diminish the ICT skill gap among students, interventions using formal education are urgently needed, and in particular, more attention should be given to both teacher training and in-service training.",2018,06/,Universal Access in the Information Society,17,2,349-60,,10.1007/s10209-017-0553-9,,#738,Kaarakainen 2018,"",""

Researchers' attitudes towards the <i>h</i>-index on Twitter 2007-2020: criticism and acceptance,"Thelwall, M.; Kousha, K.","The h-index is an indicator of the scientific impact of an academic publishing career.

Nevertheless, it is well-known by academics, used in some promotion decisions, and is prominent in bibliometric databases, such as Google Scholar. In the context of this apparent conflict, it is important to understand researchers' attitudes towards the h-index. This article used public tweets in English to analyse how scholars discuss the h-index in public: is it mentioned, are tweets about it positive or negative, and has interest decreased since its shortcomings were exposed? The January 2021 Twitter Academic Research initiative was harnessed to download all English tweets mentioning the h-index from the 2006 start of Twitter until the end of 2020. The results showed a constantly increasing number of tweets. Whilst the most popular tweets unapologetically used the h-index as an indicator of research performance, 28.5% of tweets were critical of its simplistic nature and others joked about it (8%).

Two decades of research on board gender diversity and financial outcomes: Mapping heterogeneity and future research agenda,"Laique, U.; Abdullah, F.; Rehman, I.U.; Sergi, B.S.","This study seeks to comprehend the sources of substantial heterogeneity in the findings of board gender diversity and firm financial performance over the last two decades. We present an explanatory framework primarily ignored in previous review studies and chronologically review theoretical perspectives, analytical frameworks, measures, associations, and methodologies from 1996 to 2022. We employ a four-step systematic review methodology and a three-point thematic analysis framework. Our findings provide an explanatory framework outlining various channels that impede and facilitate the impact of board gender diversity on firms' financial outcomes. Our review reveals a plethora of descriptive studies that focused solely on one rather than multiple theoretical perspectives, which is a potential limitation and the root cause of heterogeneity in existing study findings. Heterogeneity is also linked with differences across studies in capturing firm performance, statistical inquiry, periods of studies, study samples, gender diversity of independent board members, family or non-family affiliations, omitted variable bias, the proportion of women directors on corporate boards, and economic contexts. Another reason for disparities in existing research is that gender diversity is not the only measure of diversity. Consequently, it is unclear when and which kind of board diversity measure should capture a firm's financial performance. We highlight the significance of the complexity perspective to address the limitation of measuring firm financial performance intently as a function of BGD from a singular theoretical perspective. Further, to better understand the antecedents of BGD, studies should use psychological and behavioural perspectives via an interview-based research design to encapsulate the team and individual attributes of BGD. Based upon our review, we suggest that future research should consider cultural differences to understand the antecedents of BGD on firm financial performance.

Comprehensive evaluation of farmland water conservancy facilities supply performance considering differential farmer income,"Jia, Xiaohu; Ma, Hengyun; Zhu, Yuchun","The evaluation index system of farmland water conservancy facilities' supply level was constructed in this paper, and the factor analysis method was adopted to evaluate the supply level. The min-max standardization process was then used to standardize the supply level and farmers' satisfaction for 180 villages investigated, the values were taken between 0 and 1, and then the mean values of the two were taken to characterize the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities. Finally, the hierarchical linear model was used to investigate the effect of influencing factors on farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance from village level and farmer level, and analyze the way of influencing factors to affect irrigation facilities' supply performance, especially the farmers' agricultural income differences. Research shows that farmland water conservancy facilities' supply level in China is below the international average level, farmers' satisfaction of farmland water conservancy facilities has not reached rational expectations, and there is still great room for the farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance to improve. The empirical analysis of the zero model suggests that there are differences in the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities between different villages, and the factors of villages and farmers affect the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities jointly, 48.8% caused by the factors of villages. Random intercept model was used to analyze the influence degree and direction of factors of villages and farmers. From the factors of villages, the number of motor-pumped wells, the length of channel and the collection rate of water fee have a significant positive effect on farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance. The effect of agricultural income difference is significant at 5% level, and presents an inverted U-shaped relationship, and the distance away from the county doesn't have a significant influence on the farmland water conservancy facilities' supply performance. From the factors of farmers, the attention given by the government, the management of farmland water conservancy facilities, the changes of farmland water conservancy facilities in recent 5 years, comparison situation with nearby villages, convenience of irrigation and the satisfied degree to requirement of farmers have a significant positive influence on the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities; whether children attend school has a significant negative influence on the supply performance of farmland water conservancy facilities.

Gap theory based performance analysis: A case study of an Indian hostel building with passive architectural character,"Valiyappurakkal, V.K.","Meeting diversified expectations of users is a constant challenge. Only limited studies examine the perception as expectation and satisfaction of hostel building indoor environments, especially in India. This identified research gap is addressed in this study to propose a systematic indicative post-occupancy evaluation method using gap theory under the SERVQUAL model. Through site visits and focus group meetings, six main performance aspects of the hostelâs facilities were identified: visual comfort, thermal comfort, aural comfort, fire safety, hygiene, and communication. Further, a perception survey had conducted for 234 users. The thermal and hygiene aspects had shown the least expectation and satisfaction, while fire safety was the highest. This gives the idea of the preconception of users on aspects. Further, the perceptions were evaluated based on user subgroups such as gender (male and female), room type (single and double), academic year (1 and > 1), and course (UG and PG). The results show that females, single rooms, academic year > 1, and PG hold expectations higher. The service gaps range from -0.09 (fire) to -1.05 (hygiene), where this gap can be reversed. Cubic regression models were used to explain the proportion of users against change in performance gap under the aspects. This could be used for benchmarking for similar projects.

So far, several methodologies for the detection of epileptic seizures have been proposed but have not been effective. To bridge this gap, a powerful model for epileptic seizure prediction using ResneXt-LeNet is proposed. Here, a Kalman filter is used to preprocess the EEG signal to reduce noise levels in the signal. Then, feature extraction is performed to extract features, such as statistical and spectral. Feature selection is done using Fuzzy information gain that suggests appropriate choices for future processing, and finally, seizure prediction is done using hybrid ResneXt-LeNet, which is a combination of ResneXt and Lenet.

Several automated algorithms have been proposed although manual segmentation remains the benchmark. Choosing a reliable algorithm is problematic since structural definition pertaining to multiple edges, missing and fuzzy boundaries, and shape changes varies among mTLE subjects. Lack of statistical references and guidance for quantifying the reliability and reproducibility of automated techniques has further detracted from automated approaches. The purpose of this study was to develop a systematic and statistical approach using a large dataset for the evaluation of automated methods and establish a method that would achieve results better approximating those attained by manual tracing in the epileptogenic hippocampus. Methods: A template database of 195 (81 males, 114 females; age range 32-67 yr, mean 49.16 yr) MR images of mTLE patients was used in this study. Hippocampal segmentation was accomplished manually and by two well-known tools (FreeSurfer and hammer) and two previously published methods developed at their institution [Automatic brain structure segmentation (ABSS) and LocalInfo]. To establish which method was better performing for mTLE cases, several voxel-based, distance-based, and volume-based performance metrics were considered. Statistical validations of the results using automated techniques were compared with the results of benchmark manual segmentation. Extracted metrics were analyzed to find the method that provided a more similar result relative to the benchmark. Results: Among the four automated methods, ABSS generated the most accurate results. For this method, the Dice coefficient was 5.13%, 14.10%, and 16.67% higher, Hausdorff was 22.65%, 86.73%, and 69.58% lower, precision was 4.94%, â4.94%, and 12.35% higher, and the root mean square (RMS) was 19.05%, 61.90%, and 65.08% lower than LocalInfo, FreeSurfer, and hammer, respectively. The Bland-Altman similarity analysis revealed a low bias for the ABSS and LocalInfo techniques compared to the others. Conclusions: The ABSS method for automated hippocampal segmentation outperformed other methods, best approximating what could be achieved by manual tracing. This study also shows that four categories of input data can cause automated segmentation methods to fail. They include incomplete studies, artifact, low signal-to-noise ratio, and inhomogeneity.

Wrist joint torqueâangleâvelocity performance capacity envelope evaluation and modelling,"Ting Xia; Frey-Law, L.A.","A thorough understanding of human physical capability is very important for human factors.

From characteristics to practical applications of skin temperature in thermal comfort research â A comprehensive review,"Zhao, Jiaqi; Wang, Rui; Wu, Yeyu; Zhao, Chaoyi; Qi, Yun; Li, Sishi; Jiang, Haihua; Cao, Bin","Skin temperature is a widely used physiological parameter in thermal comfort research. It serves as an indicator of personnel's thermal comfort and has the potential to guide the regulation of thermal conditions in future indoor environment designs. This study reviews relevant publications from 2013 to late 2023, focusing on population differences in skin temperature (local characteristics, age, gender, etc.), changing characteristics in different environments (dynamic and non-uniform environment, sleep environment, outdoor environment, etc.), and the application of skin temperature in thermal sensation prediction and performance evaluation of devices. This study clarifies the effectiveness of skin temperature in characterizing the thermal state of the human body through a review of existing research. It also proposes directions for future work considering research limitations in personal comfort models and performance evaluation of devices. The study suggests that skin temperature is likely to play a significant role in the future due to the development of technologies such as big data and the Internet of Things.

OK computer: Worker perceptions of algorithmic recruitment,"Fumagalli, Elena; Rezaei, Sarah; Salomons, Anna","We provide evidence on how workers on an online platform perceive algorithmic versus human recruitment through two incentivized experiments designed to elicit willingness to pay for human or algorithmic evaluation. In particular, we test how information on workersâ performance affects their recruiter choice and whether the algorithmic recruiter is perceived as more or less gender-biased than the human one. We find that workers do perceive human and algorithmic evaluation differently, even though both recruiters are given the same inputs in our controlled setting. Specifically, human recruiters are perceived to be more error-prone evaluators and place more weight on personal characteristics, whereas algorithmic recruiters are seen as placing more weight on task performance. Consistent with these perceptions, workers with good task performance relative to others prefer algorithmic evaluation, whereas those with lower task performance prefer human evaluation. We also find suggestive evidence that perceived differences in gender bias drive preferences for human versus algorithmic recruitment.

To assess the Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability of FPI-6 total score and individual scores in static foot posture evaluation among elderly female patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), aiming to establish the reliability of the FPI-6 scale. 2. To investigate the disparity between dominant and non-dominant quadriceps characteristics in elderly female KOA patients, as well as explore the correlation between quadriceps characteristics and abnormal foot posture, thereby offering novel insights for the prevention and treatment of KOA.MethodsThe study enrolled a total of 80 lower legs of 40 participants (all female) with unilateral or bilateral KOA, who were assessed by two raters at three different time points. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the FPI-6 was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), while the absolute reliability of FPI-6 was examined using the standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman analysis. The internal consistency of FPI-6 was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Additionally, MyotonPRO was employed to assess quadriceps muscle tone and stiffness in all participants, and the association between quadriceps muscle tone/stiffness and the total score of FPI-6 was analyzed.ResultOur study found excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability (ICC values of 0.923 and 0.931, respectively) for the FPI-6 total score, as well as good to excellent reliability (ICC values ranging from 0.680 to 0.863 and 0.739-0.883) for individual items. The SEM and MDC values for the total score of FPI-6 among our study inter-rater were 0.78 and 2.15, respectively. and the SEM and MDC values for the test-retest total score of FPI-6 were found to be 0.76 and 2.11, respectively. Furthermore, the SEM and MDC values between inter-rater and test-retest across six individual items ranged from 0.30 to 0.56 and from 0.84 to 1.56. The Bland-Altman plots and respective 95% LOA showed no evidence of systematic bias. In terms of the mechanical properties of the quadriceps on both sides, the muscle tone and stiffness of rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), and vastus lateralis (VL) were significantly higher in the non-dominant leg compared to the dominant leg. Additionally, in the non-dominant leg, there was a significant positive correlation between the muscle tone and stiffness of VM, VL, RF and the total score of FPI-6. However, in the dominant leg, only VM's muscle tone and stiffness showed a significant positive correlation with the total score of FPI-6.ConclusionThe reliability of the FPI-6 total score and its six individual items was good to excellent. Our findings offer a straightforward and dependable approach for researchers to assess foot posture in elderly female patients with KOA. Furthermore, we observed significantly greater quadriceps tension and stiffness in the non-dominant leg compared to the dominant leg. The FPI-6 total score exhibited a significant correlation with changes in quadriceps muscle performance among KOA patients. These observations regarding the relationship between changes in quadriceps muscle performance and foot posture in elderly female KOA patients may provide novel insights for disease prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.

The effect of bra design on wearing appearance,"Wang, Yilun; Ji, Xiaofen; Pang, Chen; Zhai, Lina","Purpose: Esthetic trend changes with the development of society and cultural differences. A minimizer bra designed to make breasts appear smaller is now popular with large-breasted women in China. To conform to the requirements of modern aesthetics in China, this paper aims to investigate vital features of breast appearance that influence peopleâs subjective evaluation of breast size and analyze how bra design parameters affect breast shape and make breasts appear smaller. Design/methodology/approach: This study used 3D scanning technology and reverse engineering software to obtain objective breast measurements in detail. A subjective evaluation experiment was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of seven minimizer bras compared to a basic comparison bra. Around 20 design parameters of 8 sample bras were identified to make a further study about the correlation between bra design features and breast shaping effect. To gain a deeper understanding of how bras interact with breast tissue, this study presented heat maps of the breast surface to visualize the deformation of breast shape. Findings: Nine breasts' characteristics, such as the distance between bust points, breast depth, outer breast curvature and slope, etc. have been determined to be highly correlated with the visual reduction effect of breasts. In addition, for the bras in this experiment, the high-performance bra for women with large breasts tends to have a wider side panel, a wider under band, higher gore and a stronger transverse rigidity of the bra cup. According to the observation of heat maps of the breast surface, soft full-figure bras provide a wider range of compression to the breasts and effectively flatten the breasts. Originality/value: This paper first aimed at the need to shape the ideal breast appearance for large-breasted women and make a further study of several hot-selling minimizer bras in China. The suggestions given in this paper help lingerie manufacturers better understand how design features of bras can affect their shaping effect and improve the wearing effect of minimizer bras for large-breasted women.

Context and person-oriented leader in teams: a meta-analytical review,"Ceri-Booms, M.","Purpose - The research studies the role of contextual moderating variables on the relationship between person-oriented leadership behaviors (POLBs) and team performance. The authors claim that the varying effect sizes between POLBs and team performance are large because of the context the team is functioning in. Therefore, based on the framework of Johns (2006), this paper aims to investigate the moderating role of the relevant demographic (leader gender), social (in-group collectivism and team size), task (skill differentiation) and methodological (common method bias and the rater of the team performance) contextual variables in the study. Design/methodology/approach - The authors accumulated evidence from 48 independent primary studies (N team = 4,276) to run the meta-analytic analyses. The authors followed the procedures described by Schmidt and Hunter (2015). For the categorical moderators, the analyzes were aided by the Hunter-Schmidt meta-analysis programs (2.0) (Schmidt and Le, 2014), which is an interactive software using a random-effects model. In the analyzes for the continuous moderators, the authors used Lipsey and Wilsonâs (2001) statistical package for the social sciences macros and run meta-regressions using a random-effects model with unrestricted maximum likelihood. Findings - The results indicate that the relationship weakens when female leaders exhibit these behaviors and when the team size increases. On the other hand, in-group collectivism strengthens the relationship. The study also found that the common method bias and the assessment method of the team performance are significant moderators altering the relationship. Practical implications - The study highlights the perceptual differences and biases based on leader gender. Acknowledging these biases may help practitioners to appreciate the female qualities in leadership and decrease the undervaluation of female effectiveness. To create high-performing teams, leaders in high ingroup collectivist countries are expected to develop a family feeling in the team by showing their concern for personal issues and build close interpersonal relationships. Researchers should use multiple sources to assess the predictor and criterion variables and also opt for more objective assessment methods for team performance. Originality/value - With this study, the authors follow a substantively different perspective compared to the past meta-analytic reviews on this relationship. Rather than testing the inquiry whether there is a relationship between the two variables, the authors specifically focus on the role of contextual moderating variables. Several researchers have acknowledged that contextual considerations are critical in leadershipteam performance research. Nevertheless, the body of research remains to be not cohesive. Thus, the study answers a call in the leadership area for a more context-based and cohesive understanding of the effects of leadership on team performance.",2020,/,Team Performance Management: An International Journal,26,1-2,91-121,,10.1108/TPM-11-2019-0111,,#759,Ceri-Booms 2020,"",""

Robotic and clinical evaluation of upper limb motor performance in patients with Friedreichâs Ataxia: an observational study,"Germanotta, M.; Vasco, G.; Petrarca, M.; Rossi, S.; Carniel, S.; Bertini, E.; Cappa, P.; Castelli, E.","Background: Friedreichâs ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary autosomal recessive form of ataxia. In this disease there is early manifestation of gait ataxia, and dysmetria of the arms and legs which causes impairment in daily activities that require fine manual dexterity. To date there is no cure for this disease. Some novel therapeutic approaches are ongoing in different steps of clinical trial. Development of sensitive outcome measures is crucial to prove therapeutic effectiveness. The aim of the study was to assess the reliability and sensitivity of quantitative and objective assessment of upper limb performance computed by means of the robotic device and to evaluate the correlation with clinical and functional markers of the disease severity. Methods: Here we assess upper limb performances by means of the InMotion Arm Robot, a robot designed for clinical neurological applications, in a cohort of 14 children and young adults affected by FRDA, matched for age and gender with 18 healthy subjects. We focused on the analysis of kinematics, accuracy, smoothness, and submovements of the upper limb while reaching movements were performed. The robotic evaluation of upper limb performance consisted of planar reaching movements performed with the robotic system. The motors of the robot were turned off, so that the device worked as a measurement tool. The status of the disease was scored using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Relationships between robotic indices and a range of clinical and disease characteristics were examined. Results: All our robotic indices were significantly different between the two cohorts except for two, and were highly and reliably discriminative between healthy and subjects with FRDA. In particular, subjects with FRDA exhibited slower movements as well as loss of accuracy and smoothness, which are typical of the disease. Duration of Movement, Normalized Jerk, and Number of Submovements were the best discriminative indices, as they were directly and easily measurable and correlated with the status of the disease, as measured by SARA.

Production performance optimization of water-enhanced geothermal system based on effective time-averaged volume,"Ma, Weiwu; Xu, Yifan; Ahmed, Shams Forruque; Yang, Chong; Liu, Gang","Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) hold great promise for geothermal energy extraction. However, accurately evaluating reservoirs and fractures remains a primary challenge in optimizing the production performance of EGS. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel index, the effective time-averaged volume. It assesses the effectiveness of reservoirs and fractures, and system economy, making it a valuable tool for determining effective utilization times. Through establishing a triple-well fractured model, parametric studies are innovatively conducted. Results indicate that a reduced effective time-averaged volume leads to a higher thermal recovery rate and greater power generation. The optimized parameters of the model are a reservoir permeability of 0.5 mD, a primary fracture permeability of 50 D, an injection flow rate of 45 kg/s, an injection temperature of 20 Â°C, and a well spacing of 200 m. The cumulative power generation and effective time-averaged volume of the reservoir for 45 years are 4.89 Ã 106 GJ and 4.78 Ã 108 m3, respectively. Furthermore, we quantify the contributions of influencing factors to production performance, highlighting the significant impact of injection flow rate on system economy.

A DEA evaluation of U.S. Statesâ healthcare systems in terms of their birth outcomes,"Darabi, Negar; Ebrahimvandi, Alireza; Hosseinichimeh, Niyousha; Triantis, Konstantinos","States vary substantially in terms of infant mortality and preterm birth rates. Despite all the attention and effort at the national level in improving birth outcomes, many statesâ healthcare systems are still suffering from high rates of unfavorable birth outcomes. Hence, the important question is what makes a healthcare system more successful when evaluating birth outcomes at the state level. To answer this question, we build a stateâlevel database using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kaiser Family Foundation, and Area Health Resources File. Then, we implement a mixed-methods approach that includes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), robust principal component analysis, bootstrapping, and statistical characteristics methods such as truncated regression to systematically compare and contrast the performance of 50 state's healthcare systems with respect to their birth outcomes (i.e., infant mortality, preterm birth, and low birthweight) and to provide benchmarks. Our findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic factors such as the poverty rate and the number of African-American women per 1000 population significantly explain the major variation in healthcare systemsâ performance in terms of their birth outcomes. Therefore, disregarding these environmental factors leads to an overestimation of the system's efficiency. Furthermore, our work contributes to the body of literature by introducing a unique application in the domain of efficiency performance measurement of statesâ healthcare systems in the U.S., using a unique dataset that has not been analyzed before, identifying efficient and inefficient states, providing peers for each inefficient state and indicating how those inefficient states can make improvement in their performance, and providing unique policy insights.

Cross-population evaluation of cervical cancer risk prediction algorithms,"Elvatun, S.; Knoors, D.; Nygard, M.; Uuskula, A.; Vork, A.; Nygard, J.F.","BackgroundCervical cancer is a preventable disease, despite being one of the most common types of female cancers worldwide. Integrating existing programs for cervical cancer screening with personalized risk prediction algorithms can improve population-level cancer prevention by enabling more targeted screening and contrive preventive healthcare innovations. While algorithms developed for cervical cancer risk prediction have shown promising performance in internal validation on more homogeneous populations, their ability to generalize to external populations remains to be assessed.MethodsTo address this gap, we perform a cross-population comparative study of personalized prediction algorithms for more personalized cervical cancer screening. Using data from the Norwegian and Estonian populations, the algorithms are validated on internal and external datasets to study their potential biases and limitations when applied to different populations. We evaluate the algorithms in predicting progression from low-grade precancerous cervical lesions, simulating a clinically relevant application of more personalized risk stratification.ResultsAs expected, our numerical experiments show that algorithm performance varies depending on the population. However, some algorithms show strong generalization capacity across different data sources. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, we demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the algorithms in detecting cancer progression over time by comparing to the trends observed from data. We assess their overall discrimination performance in personalized risk predictions by analyzing the accuracy and confidence in individual risk estimates.Discussion and ConclusionThis study examines the effectiveness of personalized prediction algorithms across different populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for generalizing risk prediction algorithms to external populations. These findings highlight the importance of considering population diversity when developing risk prediction algorithms.

Deep learning evaluation of echocardiograms to identify occult atrial fibrillation,"Yuan, Neal; Stein, Nathan R.; Duffy, Grant; Sandhu, Roopinder K.; Chugh, Sumeet S.; Chen, Peng-Sheng; Rosenberg, Carine; Albert, Christine M.; Cheng, Susan; Siegel, Robert J.; Ouyang, David","Atrial fibrillation (AF) often escapes detection, given its frequent paroxysmal and asymptomatic presentation. Deep learning of transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs), which have structural information, could help identify occult AF. We created a two-stage deep learning algorithm using a video-based convolutional neural network model that (1) distinguished whether TTEs were in sinus rhythm or AF and then (2) predicted which of the TTEs in sinus rhythm were in patients who had experienced AF within 90 days. Our model, trained on 111,319 TTE videos, distinguished TTEs in AF from those in sinus rhythm with high accuracy in a held-out test cohort (AUC 0.96 (0.95â0.96), AUPRC 0.91 (0.90â0.92)). Among TTEs in sinus rhythm, the model predicted the presence of concurrent paroxysmal AF (AUC 0.74 (0.71â0.77), AUPRC 0.19 (0.16â0.23)). Model discrimination remained similar in an external cohort of 10,203 TTEs (AUC of 0.69 (0.67â0.70), AUPRC 0.34 (0.31â0.36)). Performance held across patients who were women (AUC 0.76 (0.72â0.81)), older than 65 years (0.73 (0.69â0.76)), or had a CHA2DS2VASc â¥2 (0.73 (0.79â0.77)). The model performed better than using clinical risk factors (AUC 0.64 (0.62â0.67)), TTE measurements (0.64 (0.62â0.67)), left atrial size (0.63 (0.62â0.64)), or CHA2DS2VASc (0.61 (0.60â0.62)). An ensemble model in a cohort subset combining the TTE model with an electrocardiogram (ECGs) deep learning model performed better than using the ECG model alone (AUC 0.81 vs. 0.79, p = 0.01). Deep learning using TTEs can predict patients with active or occult AF and could be used for opportunistic AF screening that could lead to earlier treatment.

Should the research performance of scientists be distinguished by gender?,"Abramo, Giovanni; Cicero, Tindaro; D'Angelo, Ciriaco Andrea","The literature on gender differences in research performance seems to suggest a gap between men and women, where the former outperform the latter. Whether one agrees with the different factors proposed to explain the phenomenon, it is worthwhile to verify if comparing the performance within each gender, rather than without distinction, gives significantly different ranking lists. If there were some structural factor that determined a penalty in performance of female researchers compared to their male peers, then under conditions of equal capacities of men and women, any comparative evaluations of individual performance that fail to account for gender differences would lead to distortion of the judgments in favor of men. In this work we measure the extent of differences in rank between the two methods of comparing performance in each field of the hard sciences: for professors in the Italian university system, we compare the distributions of research performance for men and women and subsequently the ranking lists with and without distinction by gender.

On the limits of automatic speaker verification: Explaining degraded recognizer scores through acoustic changes resulting from voice disguise,"Gonzalez Hautamaki, Rosa; Hautamaki, Ville; Kinnunen, Tomi","In speaker verification research, objective performance benchmarking of listeners and automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are of key importance in understanding the limits of speaker recognition. While the adoption of common data and metrics has been instrumental to progress in ASV, there are two major shortcomings. First, the utterances lack intentional voice changes imposed by the speaker. Second, the standard evaluation metrics focus on average performance across all speakers and trials. As a result, a knowledge gap remains in how the acoustic changes impact recognition performance at the level of individual speakers. This paper addresses the limits of speaker recognition in ASV systems under voice disguise using a linear mixed effects model to analyze the impact of change in long-term statistics of selected features (formants F1-F4, the bandwidths B1-B4, F0, and speaking rate) to ASV log-likelihood ratio (LLR) score. The correlations between the proposed predictive model and the LLR scores are 0.72 for females and 0.81 for male speakers. As a whole, the difference in long-term F0 between enrollment and test utterances was found to be the individually most detrimental factor, even if the ASV system uses only spectral, rather than prosodic, features.

However, there is still a significant gap in research when it comes to understanding and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in the field of mental health. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We conduct a broad range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction fine-tuning. The results indicate a promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform the best prompt design of GPT-3.5 (25 and 15 times bigger) by 10.9% on balanced accuracy and the best of GPT-4 (250 and 150 times bigger) by 4.8%. They further perform on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific language model. We also conduct an exploratory case study on LLMsâ capability on mental health reasoning tasks, illustrating the promising capability of certain models such as GPT-4. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for potential methods to enhance LLMsâ capability for mental health tasks.

Person retrieval in surveillance using textual query: a review,"Galiyawala, Hiren; Raval, Mehul S.","Recent advancement of research in biometrics, computer vision, and natural language processing has discovered opportunities for person retrieval from surveillance videos using textual query. The prime objective of a surveillance system is to locate a person using a description, e.g., a short woman with a pink t-shirt and white skirt carrying a black purse. She has brown hair. Such a description contains attributes like gender, height, type of clothing, colour of clothing, hair colour, and accessories. Such attributes are formally known as soft biometrics. They help bridge the semantic gap between a human description and a machine as a textual query contains the personâs soft biometric attributes. It is also not feasible to manually search through huge volumes of surveillance footage to retrieve a specific person. Hence, automatic person retrieval using vision and language-based algorithms is becoming popular. In comparison to other state-of-the-art reviews, the contribution of the paper is as follows: 1. Recommends most discriminative soft biometrics for specific challenging conditions. 2. Integrates benchmark datasets and retrieval methods for objective performance evaluation. 3.

A Comparison and Evaluation of Stereo Matching on Active Stereo Images,"Jang, Mingyu; Yoon, Hyunse; Lee, Seongmin; Kang, Jiwoo; Lee, Sanghoon","The relationship between the disparity and depth information of corresponding pixels is inversely proportional. Thus, in order to accurately estimate depth from stereo vision, it is important to obtain accurate disparity maps, which encode the difference between horizontal coordinates of corresponding image points. Stereo vision can be classified as either passive or active. Active stereo vision generates pattern texture, which passive stereo vision does not have, on the image to fill the textureless regions. In passive stereo vision, many surveys have discovered that disparity accuracy is heavily reliant on attributes, such as radiometric variation and color variation, and have found the best-performing conditions. However, in active stereo matching, the accuracy of the disparity map is influenced not only by those affecting the passive stereo technique, but also by the attributes of the generated pattern textures. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze and evaluate the relationship between the performance of the active stereo technique and the attributes of pattern texture. When evaluating, experiments are conducted under various settings, such as changing the pattern intensity, pattern contrast, number of pattern dots, and global gain, that may affect the overall performance of the active stereo matching technique. Through this evaluation, our discovery can act as a noteworthy reference for constructing an active stereo system. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Radiomics robustness assessment and classification evaluation: A two-stage method demonstrated on multivendor FFDM,"Robinson, Kayla; Li, Hui; Lan, Li; Schacht, David; Giger, Maryellen","Purpose: Radiomic texture analysis is typically performed on images acquired under specific, homogeneous imaging conditions. These controlled conditions may not be representative of the range of imaging conditions implemented clinically. We aim to develop a two-stage method of radiomic texture analysis that incorporates the reproducibility of individual texture features across imaging conditions to guide the development of texture signatures which are robust across mammography unit vendors. Methods: Full-field digital mammograms were retrospectively collected for women who underwent screening mammography on both a Hologic Lorad Selenia and GE Senographe 2000D system. Radiomic features were calculated on manually placed regions of interest in each image. In stage one (robustness assessment), we identified a set of nonredundant features that were reproducible across the two different vendors. This was achieved through hierarchical clustering and application of robustness metrics. In stage two (classification evaluation), we performed stepwise feature selection and leave-one-out quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to construct radiomic signatures. We refer to this two-state method as robustness assessment, classification evaluation (RACE). These radiomic signatures were used to classify the risk of breast cancer through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, using the area under the ROC curve as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between women with and without high-risk factors present. Generalizability was investigated by comparing the classification performance of a feature set on the images from which they were selected (intravendor) to the classification performance on images from the vendor on which it was not selected (intervendor). Intervendor and intravendor performances were also compared to the performance obtained by implementing ComBat, a feature-level harmonization method and to the performance by implementing ComBat followed by RACE.

A Hybrid Model for Fitness Influencer Competency Evaluation Framework,"Yang, C.-C.; Hsu, W.-C.J.; Yeh, C.-S.; Lin, Y.-S.","Fitness influencers are an emerging profession in recent years. At present, the main research on fitness influencers focuses on their personal traits, professional knowledge and skills, and course content, while there is still a large research gap on the social media marketing strategies of fitness influencers, how they interact with fans, and the reasons for their influence on fans. There is a lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework for fitness influencer research, and there is no clear research on what competencies are required to become a qualified fitness influencer. Therefore, it has become an important issue to establish a comprehensive fitness influencer competency evaluation. In this study, a hybrid model of fitness influencer competency evaluation framework was developed based on government competency standards and expert knowledge using the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model perspective. This evaluation should expand to include the principles of sustainable development, emphasizing the influencers' role in advocating for environmental responsibility, social equity, and economic viability within the fitness industry. First, the study developed 21 criteria in six dimensions of fitness influencer competencies through a literature survey and interviews with several experts. The 21 criteria resonate with many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The Bayesian Best-Worst Method (Bayesian BWM) was used to generate the best group weights for fitness influencer competencies. Then, a modified Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution Based on Aspiration Level (modified TOPSIS-AL) was applied to evaluate the performance ranking of major fitness influencers in Taiwan by integrating the concept of the aspiration level. The results of the study revealed that behavioral standards were the most important dimension, emphasizing the need for fitness influencers to establish a comprehensive set of norms for their own behavioral standards. The top five criteria for fitness influencers' competencies were self-review, punctuality and prudence, creativity, rapport and motivation, and the need to conform to one's body image. The performance ranking was used to compare the evaluated subjects to the desired level to obtain a basis for improvement. This study effectively identifies key fitness industry competency indicators and refines business performance through the management implications proposed in this study to facilitate the development of the fitness industry.",2024,/,Sustainability,16,3,1279 (23 pp.),,10.3390/su16031279,,#788,Yang 2024,"",""
"DeepAMO: A multi-slice, multi-view anthropomorphic model observer for visual detection tasks performed on volume images","Li, Ye; Chen, Junyu; Brown, Justin L.; Treves, S. Ted; Cao, Xinhua; Fahey, Frederic H.; Sgouros, George; Bolch, Wesley E.; Frey, Eric C.","Purpose: We propose a deep learning-based anthropomorphic model observer (DeepAMO) for image quality evaluation of multi-orientation, multi-slice image sets with respect to a clinically realistic 3D defect detection task. Approach: The DeepAMO is developed based on a hypothetical model of the decision process of a human reader performing a detection task using a 3D volume. The DeepAMO is comprised of three sequential stages: defect segmentation, defect confirmation (DC), and rating value inference. The input to the DeepAMO is a composite image, typical of that used to view 3D volumes in clinical practice. The output is a rating value designed to reproduce a human observer's defect detection performance. In stages 2 and 3, we propose: (1) a projection-based DC block that confirms defect presence in two 2D orthogonal orientations and (2) a calibration method that ""learns""the mapping from the features of stage 2 to the distribution of observer ratings from the human observer rating data (thus modeling inter- or intraobserver variability) using a mixture density network. We implemented and evaluated the DeepAMO in the context of Tc99m-DMSA SPECT imaging. A human observer study was conducted, with two medical imaging physics graduate students serving as observers. A 5 Ã 2-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted to test the statistical equivalence in defect detection performance between the DeepAMO and the human observer. We also compared the performance of the DeepAMO to an unoptimized implementation of a scanning linear discriminant observer (SLDO).

The Measurement Method of the Impact Force of Shoulder Tackle and the Influence of the Lower-Extremity Strength on the Impact Force of Shoulder Tackle in Rugby Players,"Song, Xiaoneng; Wang, Lei; Xu, Hui","With the rapid development of Internet of things engineering, intelligent sports products are gradually understood by people, providing help for the health and performance of athletes. In rugby training, coaches record and observe the force of data only based on their own experience; the impact force (IF) of shoulder tackle (ST) is a key defensive ability evaluation component for rugby players. However, the information related to female rugby players is limited. Purpose. To understand the strength characteristics of the lower-extremity of rugby players and to develop theoretical references for ST training. Methods. The force sensing device is made with FLexiForceTMA502 pressure sensor, its data acquisition adopts LabVIEW and USB. The strength of the lower extremity was tested by IsoMed 2000, and the IF of ST was measured by a testing system among eighteen Chinese female rugby players, respectively. Results. (1) The reliability and validity of the impact force tester are tested by comparing the actual load with the calibration value and the difference and correlation between the actual load value of different loads and the calibration value of it. (2) At 60Â°/s and 180Â°/s, the PT (PT) and relative PT (PT/BW) of bilateral lower-extremity extensors were greater than the flexors. (3) The flexor/extensor PT ratio of the left knee at 60Â°/s was higher than the right knee. (4) The linear regression equation was established between PT of dominant-side knee extensors and IF of ST. The coefficient Î² of the linear regression equation was 0.866, 0.862, 0.892, 0.722, 0.788, and 0.737, respectively. Conclusions. (1) The design uses LabVIEW, USB, and FLexiForceTM A502 pressure sensor to complete the overall construction of the data acquisition system and impact force sensing device. (2) It is feasible to use the extensor strength of the dominant-side knee joint as a reference index to evaluate the IF of ST. (3) The balanced development of the front/reverse ST techniques can enhance its defensive capacity of it.

Sensitivity and specificity estimation using patient-specific microwave imaging in diverse experimental breast phantoms,"O'Loughlin, Declan; Oliveira, Barbara L.; Santorelli, Adam; Porter, Emily; Glavin, Martin; Jones, Edward; Popovic, Milica; O'Halloran, Martin","Many new clinical investigations of microwave breast imaging have been published in recent years. Trials with over one hundred participants have indicated the potential of microwave imaging to detect breast cancer, with particularly encouraging sensitivity results reported from women with dense breasts. The next phase of clinical trials will involve larger and more diverse populations, including women with no breast abnormalities or benign breast diseases. These trials will need to address clinical efficacy in terms of sensitivity and specificity. A number of challenges exist when using microwave imaging with broad populations: 1) addressing the substantial variance in breast composition observed in the population and 2) achieving high specificity given differences between individuals. This paper analyses these challenges using a diverse phantom set which models the variance in breast composition and tumor shape and size seen in the population. The data show that the sensitivity of microwave breast imaging in breasts of differing density can suffer if patient-specific beamforming is not used. Moreover, the results suggest that achieving high specificity in dense breasts may be difficult, but that patient-specific beamforming does not adversely affect the expected specificity. In summary, this paper finds that patient-specific beamforming has a tangible impact on expected sensitivity in experimental cases and that achieving high specificity in dense breasts may be challenging.

Multimedia patient education to assist oral impression taking during dental treatment: a pilot study,Dandan Pei; Beilei Liang; Wenzhi Du; Peng Wang; Jie Liu; Min He; Yi Lu,"Introduction: Proper cooperation between patient and dentist is of great help to make a good oral impression. However, patients are frequently confused when information is given through traditional verbal description. The present study compared the effectiveness of the multimedia information delivery ways with the traditional verbal manner on patientsâ understanding level in oral impression taking. Methods: The recruited 191 participating patients were randomly assigned to the control group (the verbal group) and two intervention groups (the video group and the picture group) according to the information delivery manner. After intervention, the patientsâ understanding degree was measured by questionnaire and performance evaluation of behavior feedback on the provided information quantitatively. Also, patientsâ self-assessment of satisfaction was interviewed by telephone. All data was analyzed by SPSS 14.0 software, and p â¤ 0.05 was set as significant difference in advance. Results: One-Way ANOVA and Chi-square showed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean age, gender composition, and educational level among the three groups (P > 0.05). In both questionnaire assessment and performance evaluation, One-Way ANOVA followed by LSD indicate that the video group gained a higher score than the verbal group or the picture group (P  0.05). Higher percentage of satisfaction was reported by patients in the two multimedia groups than that in the control group. Discussion: Oral impression taking is a consecutive process that requires action cooperation between dentists and patients simultaneously. This particularity makes it more suitable for multimedia delivery. The delivery of tailored information using multimedia in this study was favored by most patients and could improve the degree of patient understanding of the oral impression taking procedures.

Benchmarking deep network architectures for ethnicity recognition using a new large face dataset,"Greco, Antonio; Percannella, Gennaro; Vento, Mario; Vigilante, Vincenzo","Although in recent years we have witnessed an explosion of the scientific research in the recognition of facial soft biometrics such as gender, age and expression with deep neural networks, the recognition of ethnicity has not received the same attention from the scientific community. The growth of this field is hindered by two related factors: on the one hand, the absence of a dataset sufficiently large and representative does not allow an effective training of convolutional neural networks for the recognition of ethnicity; on the other hand, the collection of new ethnicity datasets is far from simple and must be carried out manually by humans trained to recognize the basic ethnicity groups using the somatic facial features. To fill this gap in the facial soft biometrics analysis, we propose the VGGFace2 Mivia Ethnicity Recognition (VMER) dataset, composed by more than 3,000,000 face images annotated with 4 ethnicity categories, namely African American, East Asian, Caucasian Latin and Asian Indian. The final annotations are obtained with a protocol which requires the opinion of three people belonging to different ethnicities, in order to avoid the bias introduced by the well-known other race effect. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive performance analysis of popular deep network architectures, namely VGG-16, VGG-Face, ResNet-50 and MobileNet v2. Finally, we perform a cross-dataset evaluation to demonstrate that the deep network architectures trained with VMER generalize on different test sets better than the same models trained on the largest ethnicity dataset available so far.

3D Human cartilage surface characterization by optical coherence tomography,"Brill, Nicolai; Riedel, Jorn; Schmitt, Robert; Tingart, Markus; Truhn, Daniel; Pufe, Thomas; Jahr, Holger; Nebelung, Sven","Early diagnosis and treatment of cartilage degeneration is of high clinical interest. Loss of surface integrity is considered one of the earliest and most reliable signs of degeneration, but cannot currently be evaluated objectively. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an arthroscopically available light-based non-destructive real-time imaging technology that allows imaging at micrometre resolutions to millimetre depths. As OCT-based surface evaluation standards remain to be defined, the present study investigated the diagnostic potential of 3D surface profile parameters in the comprehensive evaluation of cartilage degeneration. To this end, 45 cartilage samples of different degenerative grades were obtained from total knee replacements (2 males, 10 females; mean age 63.8 years), cut to standard size and imaged using a spectral-domain OCT device (Thorlabs, Germany). 3D OCT datasets of 8 Ã 8, 4 Ã 4 and 1 Ã 1 mm (width Ã length) were obtained and pre-processed (image adjustments, morphological filtering). Subsequent automated surface identification algorithms were used to obtain the 3D primary profiles, which were then filtered and processed using established algorithms employing ISO standards. The 3D surface profile thus obtained was used to calculate a set of 21 3D surface profile parameters, i.e. height (e.g. Sa), functional (e.g. Sk), hybrid (e.g. Sdq) and segmentation-related parameters (e.g. Spd). Samples underwent reference histological assessment according to the Degenerative Joint Disease classification. Statistical analyses included calculation of Spearman's rho and assessment of inter-group differences using the Kruskal Wallis test. Overall, the majority of 3D surface profile parameters revealed significant degeneration-dependent differences and correlations with the exception of severe end-stage degeneration and were of distinct diagnostic value in the assessment of surface integrity. None of the 3D surface profile parameters investigated were capable of reliably differentiating healthy from early-degenerative cartilage, while scan area sizes considerably affected parameter values. In conclusion, cartilage surface integrity may be adequately assessed by 3D surface profile parameters, which should be used in combination for the comprehensive and thorough evaluation and overall improved diagnostic performance. OCT- and image-based surface assessment could become a valuable adjunct tool to standard arthroscopy.

An on-device gender prediction method for mobile users using representative wordsets,Yerim Choi; Yoonjung Kim; Solee Kim; Kyuyon Park; Jonghun Park,"With the proliferation of mobile devices and the growing necessity for gender information in personalized intelligent systems, gender prediction of mobile users has become an important research issue. Text data in mobile devices are known to have high discriminative power for gender, but transmitting those data to the outside of a device has a security risk and raises a privacy concern of users. This study introduces an on-device gender prediction framework, by which the entire data analysis is performed inside a device minimizing the privacy risk. To cope with the resource limitation of mobile devices, gender information of a user is predicted by matching the userâs mobile text data against gender representative wordsets which are constructed from web documents using a word evaluation measure. From the experiments conducted on real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed framework was confirmed, and it was concluded that not only discriminability of a word but also popularity should be considered for the on-device gender prediction. The proposed framework is simple yet very powerful for gender prediction that its practical application to various expert and intelligent systems is possible attributed to the low computational complexity and high prediction performances.

Hydraulic modeling and prediction of performance for a drinking water supply system towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs): A system case study from Uganda,"Dadebo, Derrick; Obura, Denis; Kimera, David","The world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health, pollution, and ecosystem damage. Maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long-term demographic transition would achieve sustainability. This study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system, Najjembe Town water supply scheme, Uganda. Results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0.01 to 2.36 m/s. The pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario, and pipes never run full. Flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). The negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand. The proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure (TPIP) and velocity (TPIV) to 89.9â99.3% and 80.9â99.5%, respectively. The implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals (SDGs) interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2), promoting good human health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting gender equality (SDG 5), and economic growth (SDG 8). Defining the linkage between water supply management planning and SDGs would assist in the long-term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy-makers in the sector in making well-informed decisions.

Data were collected from eight subjects (four females) without a known history of voice disorders. The proposed muscle network is composed of pairwise coherence between sEMG recordings. The network metrics include (a) network degree and (b) weighted clustering coefficient (WCC).Results:The varied phonation tasks showed the median degree, and WCC of the muscle network ascend monotonically, with a high effect size (|rrb| â¼ 0.5).

Statistical mechanical evaluation of a spread-spectrum watermarking model with image restoration,"Kawamura, Masaki; Hayashi, Kao; Uezu, Tatsuya; Okada, Masato","In cases in which an original image is blind, a decoding method where both the image and the messages can be estimated simultaneously is desirable. We propose a spread spectrum watermarking model with image restoration based on Bayes estimation. We therefore need to assume some prior probabilities. The probability for estimating the messages is given by the uniform distribution, and the ones for the image are given by the infinite-range model and two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. Any attacks from unauthorized users can be represented by channel models. We can obtain the estimated messages and image by maximizing the posterior probability. We analyzed the performance of the proposed method by the replica method in the case of the infinite-range model. We first calculated the theoretical values of the bit error rate from obtained saddle-point equations and then verified them by computer simulations. For this purpose, we assumed that the image is binary and is generated from a given prior probability. We also assume that attacks can be represented by the Gaussian channel. The computer simulation retults agreed with the theoretical values. In the case of prior probability given by the 2D Ising model, in which each pixel is statically connected with four-neighbors, we evaluated the decoding performance by computer simulations, since the replica theory could not be applied. Results using the 2D Ising model showed that the proposed method with image restoration is as effective as the infinite-range model for decoding messages. We compared the performances in a case in which the image was blind and one in which it was informed. The difference between these cases was small as long as the embedding and attack rates were small. This demonstrates that the proposed method with simultaneous estimation is effective as a watermarking decoder.

We applied the A-CPLM system to measure linear birefringence (LB) in the visible region, which is an optical anisotropic property, for tiny single crystals causing arthritis, i.e. monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD). The A-CPLM system performance was evaluated by comparing the obtained experimental data using the A-CPLM system with (i) literature data for a standard sample, MgF2, and (ii) experimental data obtained using an established optical method, high-accuracy universal polarimeter, for the MSUM.

An effective method for computerized prediction and segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MRI,"Roy, Sudipta; Bhattacharyya, Debnath; Bandyopadhyay, Samir Kumar; Kim, Tai-Hoon","Background and objectives Multiple sclerosis is one of the major diseases and the progressive MS lesion formation often leads to cognitive decline and physical disability. A quick and perfect method for estimating the number and size of MS lesions in the brain is very important in estimating the progress of the disease and effectiveness of treatments. But, the accurate identification, characterization and quantification of MS lesions in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely difficult due to the frequent change in location, size, morphology variation, intensity similarity with normal brain tissues, and inter-subject anatomical variation of brain images. Methods This paper presents a method where adaptive background generation and binarization using global threshold are the key steps for MS lesions detection and segmentation. After performing three phase level set, we add third phase segmented region with contour of brain to connect the normal tissues near the boundary. Then remove all lesions except maximum connected area and corpus callosum of the brain to generate adaptive background. The binarization method is used to select threshold based on entropy and standard deviation preceded by non-gamut image enhancement. The background image is then subtracted from binarized image to find out segmented MS lesions. Results The step of subtraction of background from binarized image does not generate spurious lesions. Binarization steps correctly identify the MS lesions and reduce over or under segmentation. The average Kappa index is 94.88%, Jacard index is 90.43%, correct detection ration is 92.60284%, false detection ratio is 2.55% and relative area error is 5.97% for proposed method. Existing recent methods does not have such accuracy and low value of error rate both mathematically as well as visually due to many spurious lesions generation and over segmentation problems. Conclusions Proposed method accurately identifies the size and number of lesions as well as location of lesions detection as a radiologist performs. The adaptability of the proposed method creates a number of potential opportunities for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI. Proposed method gives an improved accuracy and low error compare to existing recent methods.

A Case of Specificity: How Does the Acoustic Voice Quality Index Perform in Normophonic Subjects?,"Batthyany, C.; Maryn, Y.; Trauwaen; Caelenberghe, E.; van Dinther, J.; Zarowski, A.; Wuyts, F.","The acoustic voice quality index (AVQI) is a multiparametric tool based on six acoustic measurements to quantify overall voice quality in an objective manner, with the smoothed version of the cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) as its main contributor. In the last decade, many studies demonstrated its robust diagnostic accuracy and high sensitivity to voice changes across voice therapy in different languages. The aim of the present study was to provide information regarding AVQIâs and CPPSâs performance in normophonic non-treatment-seeking subjects, since these data are still scarce; concatenated voice samples, consisting of sustained vowel phonation and continuous speech, from 123 subjects (72 females, 51 males; between 20 and 60 years old) without vocally relevant complaints were evaluated by three raters and run in AVQI v.02.06. According to this auditory-perceptual evaluation, two cohorts were set up (normophonia versus slight perceived dysphonia). First, gender effects were investigated. Secondly, between-cohort differences in AVQI and CPPS were investigated. Thirdly, with the number of judges giving G = 1 to partition three sub-levels of slight hoarseness as an independent factor, differences in AVQI and CPPS across these sub-levels were investigated; for AVQI, no significant gender effect was found, whereas, for CPPS, significant trends were observed. For both AVQI and CPPS, no significant differences were found between normophonic and slightly dysphonic subjects. For AVQI, however, this difference did approach significance; these findings emphasize the need for a normative study with a greater sample size and subsequently greater statistical power to detect possible significant effects and differences.",2019,06/,Applied Sciences,9,12,2527 (12 pp.),,10.3390/app9122527,,#808,Batthyany 2019,"",""
Use of community perceptions to evaluate and adapt coastal resource management practices in the Philippines,"Mudge, Laura","Coastal resource management (CRM) programs have been implemented in the Philippines since the 1980s with the specific intent to protect and rehabilitate coastal habitats and enhance the sustainability of coastal communities. However, the implementation of these programs alone does not guarantee the success of program objectives. Monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents. Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there is a high level of interest for participating in future management activities. This study exemplifies how perceptions and associated contextual information of the community provides invaluable insights into the effectiveness of coastal resource management and be incorporated into the adaptive management cycle.

Multi criteria decision making approaches for green supplier evaluation and selection: A literature review,"Govindan, Kannan; Rajendran, Sivakumar; Sarkis, Joseph; Murugesan, P.","A large and growing body of literature to supplier evaluation and selection exists. Literature on green supplier evaluation that considers environmental factors are relatively limited. Recently, in supply chain management decision making, approaches for evaluating green supplier performance have used both qualitative and quantitative environmental data. Given this evolving research field, the goal and purpose of this paper is to analyze research in international scientific journals and international conference proceedings that focus on green supplier selection. We propose the following questions that will be answered: (i) which selection approaches are commonly applied?, (ii) what environmental and other selection criteria for green supplier management are popular?, (iii) and what limitations exist? Published research from 1997 to 2011 is structurally reviewed based on the first two questions. We find that the applied techniques are mostly fuzzy based single model approaches. The most common criterion considered for green supplier selection was ""environmental management systems"". A further critical analysis is completed and gaps in the current literature are identified. These gaps help us to identify improvements for green supplier selection process and possible future directions.

Deep learning for automated skeletal bone age assessment in X-ray images,"Spampinato, C.; Palazzo, S.; Giordano, D.; Aldinucci, M.; Leonardi, R.","Skeletal bone age assessment is a common clinical practice to investigate endocrinology, genetic and growth disorders in children. It is generally performed by radiological examination of the left hand by using either the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method or the TannerâWhitehouse (TW) one. However, both clinical procedures show several limitations, from the examination effort of radiologists to (most importantly) significant intra- and inter-operator variability. To address these problems, several automated approaches (especially relying on the TW method) have been proposed; nevertheless, none of them has been proved able to generalize to different races, age ranges and genders. In this paper, we propose and test several deep learning approaches to assess skeletal bone age automatically; the results showed an average discrepancy between manual and automatic evaluation of about 0.8 years, which is state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, this is the first automated skeletal bone age assessment work tested on a public dataset and for all age ranges, races and genders, for which the source code is available, thus representing an exhaustive baseline for future research in the field. Beside the specific application scenario, this paper aims at providing answers to more general questions about deep learning on medical images: from the comparison between deep-learned features and manually-crafted ones, to the usage of deep-learning methods trained on general imagery for medical problems, to how to train a CNN with few images.

Human peeling was simulated through the use of novel force measurement equipment. The results showed that the maximum machine peel force set by standard test methods was generally lower than the human peel force for most sealing temperatures. In all film types no significant difference was shown between genders, although for people over 65 years of age, peel force was generally lower than for the younger cohort.

Multi-site, multi-vendor cardiac MRI datasets comprising 95 patients (73 men, 22 women; mean age 62.73 Â± 11.24 years) with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction, were randomly selected from data made available by the Cardiac Atlas Project (Fonseca et al., 2011). Three semi- and two fully-automated raters segmented the left ventricular myocardium from short-axis cardiac MR images as part of a challenge introduced at the STACOM 2011 MICCAI workshop (Suinesiaputra et al., 2012). Consensus myocardium images were generated based on the ExpectationâMaximization principle implemented by the STAPLE algorithm (Warfield et al., 2004). The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values ranged between 0.63 and 0.85, 0.60 and 0.98, 0.56 and 0.94, and 0.83 and 0.92, respectively, against the STAPLE consensus. Spatial and temporal agreement varied in different amounts for each rater. STAPLE produced high quality consensus images if the region of interest was limited to the area of discrepancy between raters. To maintain the quality of the consensus, an objective measure based on the candidate automated rater performance distribution is proposed. The consensus segmentation based on a combination of manual and automated raters were more consistent than any particular rater, even those with manual input. The consensus is expected to improve with the addition of new automated contributions.

The inclusion of case studies in course assessment post COVID-19 restrictions is also expected to give a rough insight into students' employability skills and workplace readiness. Design/methodology/approach: The academic performance of 489 undergraduate students, as determined by the grades they earned, was measured in the final exams of business-to-business marketing and integrated marketing communication courses, held in January 2021 and 2022 at a Greek public university. The primary predictor variable or interest was ""teaching and assessment format"", and took two values: (1) online teaching with multiple-choice assessment format (during COVID-19 restrictions); and (2) traditional classroom teaching with in-person case study and open-ended assessment format (post COVID-19 restrictions). Findings: Grades were found to be affected by the participants' year of study, the type of marketing course, in which they were examined, and the teaching and assessment format employed. Either in whole or by gender, students appear to perform significantly worse in the traditional teaching with in-person case study and open-ended questions assessment format.

Accordingly, the relationships between student grades, the preferred method, and student satisfaction levels were examined by residential region and gender. The study was conducted on 371 university students from seven universities in different geographical regions of Turkey. A survey design, one of the quantitative research methods, was preferred in the study. The analysis results showed that the most preferred online assessment methods by the academics during the COVID-19 pandemic included homework (93%), timed online examinations (92%), and online presentation (76%). When students' attitudes towards those assessment methods were examined, we found that students' favorite online assessment method was homework (71%), and timed online examinations (46%) and online presentations (31%) were the least preferred methods. Besides, the students received the highest grades (76 and above) by doing online homework (72%), online presentations (69%), and projects (62%). They received the lowest scores in online examinations (50%). The findings revealed a positive and significant relationship between students' satisfaction with online assessment methods and their grades, but there was no significant difference between student satisfaction and gender variable. The university's region was also an influential factor in determining student satisfaction. In conclusion, both faculty members/academics and students predominantly preferred the homework method, and the students received the highest grades with this method. Although the most preferred assessment method in face-to-face and online education is testing, most academics did not prefer e-tests, mainly stemming from their lack of experience in administering online tests and managing the potential problems of online assessment methods.",2022,,Malaysian Online Journal of Educational Technology,10,4,294-305,2861190694; EJ1364912,,,#820,Arslan 2022,"",""
College Students' Perceived Teaching Presence in Emergency Remote Online Mathematics Teaching,"Taley, Isaac Bengre","In this period of the COVID-19 outbreak, the interest in replacing conventional face-to-face teaching with online teaching in Ghana's Colleges of Education has sown amidst concerns about the presence of teaching.

This study examined college students' perception of mathematics teaching presence and how gender and the mode of interaction affected students' sense of teaching presence during the emergency remote online teaching of mathematics. The results showed that about 82.7% of the students had a moderate to a high sense of mathematics teaching presence in the emergency remote online teaching. This means that mathematics teachers were unable to identify the mathematics learning needs, neither were teachers able to manage collaborative and reflective work, nor averted undirected discourse among 27.3% of the students. Although the gender of students did not affect the sense of mathematics teaching, the result indicated that in the absence of asynchronous mode of interaction, synchronous and blended modes of interaction positively affected students' perceived mathematics teaching presence. Altogether, this study urges mathematics teachers to employ creative pedagogical approaches that make teaching presence more conspicuous to students in emergency remote online mathematics teaching.",2022,,Journal of Research and Advances in Mathematics Education,7,3,116-129,2860855616; EJ1361523,,,#821,Taley 2022,"",""

As universities manage the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, they will also need to take into account the effect of remote teaching on the validity of student evaluation data. Given SET are critical to promotion success, it is important to then understand the gendered effect of remote teaching on student evaluations. We aimed to evaluate how intrusions of family life, academics' home environment and competence with remote teaching technology of female academics were viewed by students and if there were noticeable differences in SET data. We analysed 22,485 SET data over 2019 (pre-COVID, face-to-face teaching) and 2020 (COVID-lockdowns, remote teaching) for female and male academics, matched with student gender, in the multidisciplinary First Year College at Victoria University, Melbourne Australia. Our results showed that there were no differences in the score ratings for teacher gender. However, the qualitative data showed that whilst overall there were overwhelmingly positive comments for both male and female teachers, there was an increase in the negative comments on teaching style by male students toward their female teachers during remote teaching and overall more comments relating to attitude. We speculate that this would have a negative impact on the confidence of teaching-intensive female academics hindering their leadership aspirations and career progression in academia.",2022,,Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,19,1,160-173,2674265030; EJ1336073,,,#822,Tangalakis 2022,"",""

This paper first discusses a psychometric evaluation of the BEK assessment to understand its basic measurement properties and to examine various group-level differences based on demographic, institutional, and instructor characteristics. Subsequently, the relationship between BEK scores on the 23 retained items and performance on an existing complex collaborative simulation-based electronics task is discussed. Results demonstrated that basic content knowledge alone may not be sufficient for students to demonstrate knowledge of electronics skills on more complex tasks. The research also carries great importance given ongoing concerns about improving the overall state and diversity of the engineering workforce and its associated pipeline to meet the demands of the national economy.",2020,,ETS Research Report Series,,,,2535415686; EJ1284953,,,#827,Steinberg 2020,"",""
Students' Self-Assessment Behavior in Mathematics Courses: A Function of Their Performance on Academic Assignments,"Nepal, Kedar; Sharma, Ramjee Prasad; Thapa, Manoj","The authors asked students enrolled in a wide range of college mathematics courses to predict their scores on quizzes and exams. They found that top and bottom performers were less accurate predictors, but those scoring in the middle range were more accurate in predicting their scores. Females were more accurate predictors of their scores than males. Results showed that self-assessment behavior is a function of performance on individual academic assignments. Students self-assessed their performances differently according to how they performed on assignments. The self-assessment accuracy of low-performing students improved over time when they were continuously asked to predict their scores. Results showed that improved self-assessment accuracy was also linked to higher academic achievement for those students.",2020,,Journal on Excellence in College Teaching,31,3,29-49,2535295087; EJ1280493,,,#828,Nepal 2020,"",""
Impact of Students Evaluation of Teaching: A Text Analysis of the Teachers' Qualities by Gender,"Okoye, Kingsley; Arrona-Palacios, Arturo; Camacho-ZuÃ±iga, Claudia; Hammout, Nisrine; Nakamura, Emilia Luttmann; Escamilla, Jose; Hosseini, Samira","Today, modern educational models are concerned with the development of the teacher-student experience and the potential opportunities it presents. User-centric analyses are useful both in terms of the socio-technical perspective on data usage within the educational domain and the positive impact that data-driven methods have. Moreover, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and process ""innovation"" has emerged due to the strategic perspectives and the process ""monitoring"" that have shown to be missing within the traditional education curricula. This study shows that there is an unprecedented increase in the amount of text-based data in different activities within the educational processes, which can be leveraged to provide useful strategic intelligence and improvement insights. Educators can apply the resultant methods and technologies, process innovations, and contextual-based information for ample support and monitoring of the teaching-learning processes and decision making. To this effect, this paper proposes an Educational Process and Data Mining (EPDM) model that leverages the perspectives or opinions of the students to provide useful information that can be used to enhance the end-to-end processes within the educational domain. Theoretically, this study applies the model to determine how the students evaluate their teachers by considering the gender of the teachers. We analyzed the underlying patterns and determined the emotional valence of the students based on their comments in the Students Evaluation of Teaching (SET).

To this end, a total number of 229,493 students' information obtained from the last cycle of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study was handled. Unlike previous studies in which success has been tried to be explained with some factors, this research extended the literature by investigating the effective factors as well as gender-related variability on science success with a holistic view. Using heterogeneous choice models, unobserved heterogeneity caused by gender difference was tested and controlled. The findings showed that gender variability was evident for 10 countries.

"Identifying Exceptional Talent in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: Increasing Diversity and Assessing Creative Problem-Solving","Maker, C. June","In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving.

Over a third of assessment feedback files (38%, 553 files) were never accessed by students. When students could obtain their assessment mark without opening the associated feedback file, 42% of feedback files were not accessed by students (513 of 1224 files). When assessment marks were integrated into the feedback file (and not reported within the LMS), the proportion of unopened feedback dropped significantly to only 17% of files (40 of 238 files). We uncovered strong gender-specific differences in how students accessed feedback within the LMS that were dependent upon academic performance and the integration of marks within the feedback file. Poorly performing males were less likely to access feedback; however, integrating marks into the feedback files meant that males were over 27 times more likely to access the feedback file. In contrast, females exhibited a much weaker and more variable response to marks being reported within feedback files.

A New Assessment to Monitor Student Performance in Introductory Neurophysiology: Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device,"Cerchiara, Jack A.; Kim, Kerry J.; Meir, Eli; Wenderoth, Mary Pat; Doherty, Jennifer H.","The basis for understanding neurophysiology is understanding ion movement across cell membranes. Students in introductory courses recognize ion concentration gradients as a driving force for ion movement but struggle to simultaneously account for electrical charge gradients. We developed a 17-multiple-choice item assessment of students' understanding of electrochemical gradients and resistance in neurophysiology, the Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD). We investigated the internal evidence validity of the assessment by analyzing item characteristic curves of score probability and student ability for each question, and a Wright map of student scores and ability. We used linear mixed-effect regression to test student performance and ability. Our assessment discriminated students with average ability (weighted likelihood estimate: -2 to 1.5 [theta]); however, it was not as effective at discriminating students at the highest ability (weighted likelihood estimate: >2 [theta]). We determined the assessment could capture changes in both assessment scores (model r[superscript 2] = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability estimates (model r[superscript 2] = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444) after a simulation-based laboratory and course instruction for 222 students. Differential item function analysis determined that each item on the assessment performed equitably for all students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, or economic status. Overall, we found that men scored higher (r[superscript 2] = 0.51, P = 0.014, n = 444) and had higher ability scores (P = 0.003) on the EGAD assessment.

Aim: This study examined the influence of instructor personality (as reported by both students and instructors themselves) on student educational outcomes at university. Sample and method: Mathematics and psychology university students (N = 515) and their instructors (n = 45) reported their personality under the Big Five framework. Results: Multilevel regressions were conducted to predict each outcome from instructor personality, taking into account the effects of student gender, age, cognitive ability, and personality, as well as instructor gender and age. Student-reports of instructor personality predicted student evaluations of teaching but not performance self-efficacy or academic achievement. Instructor self-reports did not predict any of the outcomes. Stronger associations between student-reports and the outcomes than instructor self-reports could be explained by students providing information on both the predictor and the outcome variables, as well as a greater number of raters providing information on instructor personality.

The number of qualitative comments was significantly greater in the online feedback than in the manual feedback. Impact on Society: The findings of this study refute the claims with regard to the unreliability of an online teaching evaluation. These findings reflect the advantages of using online feedback, such as cost savings, granting more time to students in order to provide feedback, and reducing disturbance during lectures. Recommendations: It would be of great importance to explore if any differences would be found in evaluating students' feedback according to their learning disciplines. Future Research: The gender aspect was not taken into account in this study. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct a follow-up study that will examine gender differences.",2017,,Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice,16,,277-290,2034277089; EJ1170987,,,#848,Esmael 2017,"",""

Analyzing the Implementation of an ERP System by Self-Assessment in Higher Education,"MÃ¡tÃ©, DomiciÃ¡n; BÃ¡cs, ZoltÃ¡n; TakÃ¡cs, Viktor LÃ¡szlÃ³","Over the last few decades, not only organizations but also Higher Education Institutions should be more responsive to the demands of the changed global business environment and improve their effectiveness. Our motivation to write this paper is to assess the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in higher education and their associated benefits, with a focus on students' performance when applying an SAP solution. This paper analyses the accuracy of undergraduate students, focusing primarily on the concept of self-assessment as they predict and evaluate their own performance relative to their externally assessed achievement. In the pre- and post-examination predictions the higher achieving students seem to predict and evaluate their examination results more accurately than their lower-achieving fellows. Although a gender gap cannot be found in self-estimation, we found substantial differences by comparing the selected language. Foreign students seem to overestimate their own examination performance to a greater degree than Hungarians do. Consequently, our results might allow decision makers to identify why self-assessment is important when implementing pilot ERP projects. The result of this study also provide evidence for groups of clients and other stakeholders in order to reduce failure in both higher education and business environment.",2017,,Acta Didactica Napocensia,10,2,45-56,1969015235; EJ1156615,,,#850,MÃ¡tÃ© 2017,"",""

Dissecting the Voice: Health Professions Students' Perceptions of Instructor Age and Gender in an Online Environment and the Impact on Evaluations for Faculty,"Doubleday, Alison F.; Lee, Lisa M. J.","Gender and age bias is well-documented in academia with many studies demonstrating bias in students' evaluations of instructors. Failure of an instructor to meet gender or age-based expectations can translate to lower scores or negative comments on evaluations. While there is some evidence of bias in students' evaluations of online instructors, current studies have not fully examined the relationship between bias and instructor vocal characteristics. First-year dental students at two institutions were randomly assigned one of four videos on spinal cord anatomy to view. Videos contained identical content but were narrated by individuals of different gender and age (younger man, younger woman, older man, older woman). Students completed a content-based prequiz, watched the video, completed a postquiz, and answered a questionnaire evaluating the video and instructor. Students at Institution A rated the younger man and younger woman highest for nearly every evaluation category. At Institution B students rated the older man and younger woman highest. Results reveal that the older woman's voice received the lowest rankings for nearly every question in both samples. This report confirms the presence of gender and age bias in student evaluations of instructors in an online environment and demonstrates that bias may surface in response to vocal characteristics. Bias may impact older women more significantly than other groups.

One approach to lab instruction, engages students in the empirical practices of science but in a traditional prescriptive manner designed to demonstrate and verify content. The second approach, Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI), engages students in both the empirical and representational practices of science. A practical exam was used to compare student learning in each condition. The assessment targeted student ability to participate in specific scientific practices, including planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data and arguing from evidence. Students who were taught with either ADI (N = 81) or Traditional (N = 76) had equivalent understanding of content based on the ACS-GCST exam, however the mean score on the practical exam was significantly higher for students in the ADI sections. Results also indicate that the mean scores on the practical exam were significantly higher in the ADI sections for all students including female students, under-represented minority (URM) students, and students with lower past academic achievement. In the traditional laboratory sections there was a significant difference in the mean scores on the practical exam for the URM student relative to the majority, which was not present in the ADI sections.

Student Evaluations of Physics Teachers: On the Stability and Persistence of Gender Bias,"Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra","There is a long history of research which confounds the simple interpretation that evaluations in an educational context are purely measures of competency. One such issue is that of gender bias in student evaluations of their teachers. In our prior work, we found that male students underrated female high school teachers in biology and chemistry while all students underrated female high school teachers in physics. In the current work, we independently checked and extended this earlier work to examine the effect of physics identity on student evaluations and gender bias. Employing multiple regression on survey data from a representative sample of 6772 college students across the U.S., attending both 2-year and 4-year post-secondary institutions (including STEM and non-STEM majors), we find the core physics effect is unchanged despite a gap between studies of nearly 10 years. Namely, both male and female students underrate their female high school physics teachers, even after controlling for physics grades and classroom experiences. Our new focus on physics identity reveals that students with a strong physics identity show a larger gender bias in favor of male teachers than those with less of a physics identity. These results may help to explain how structures that privilege certain groups and marginalize others are prevalent amongst the youngest members of a defined physics community and may serve to uphold the status quo as these young members traverse to higher levels of physics community membership. Furthermore, biased evaluative feedback structures may be one of the propagators of women's lower competency beliefs in physics, a result that has been found by many prior studies.

Differences between Students with and without ADHD on Task Vigilance under Conditions of Distraction,"Ross, Peter; Randolph, Justus","Distraction is a typical component of any classroom environment. For effective instruction and learning to take place, it is critical for students to eventually return to task and maintain task vigilance (i.e., returning to the task at hand) when a distraction occurs. Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), by definition, are more distractible than students without ADHD. However, studies showing specific variability of task vigilance between students with and without ADHD are limited. This correlational study examined the differences in distractibility on task vigilance between students with and without ADHD under conditions of distraction. Two groups of participants, ranging in age from 7 to 11 years, were identified. The participants with existing diagnoses of ADHD were matched to participants without ADHD by gender, age, grade, race, school performance, and ability to help maintain group equivalence. The procedure called for all students to complete simple math computations and copying tasks while exposed to a distracting stimulus. Results showed a marked, statistically significant difference in task completion rates for both tasks between groups. Secondly, students with ADHD had considerable difficulties disengaging from the distracting stimulus and returning to task (i.e., maintaining task vigilance). These findings, rather than generic deficits, may account for a large portion of underachievement suffered by students with ADHD. Treatment recommendations and implications for teaching students with ADHD are discussed.",2016,,Journal of Educational Research and Practice,4,1,1-10,1969009185; EJ1118451,,,#859,Ross 2016,"",""

Whose Feedback?

While much research has examined the validity of SETs for measuring teaching quality, few studies have investigated the factors that influence student participation in the SET process. This study aimed to address this deficit through the analysis of an SET respondent pool at a large Canadian research-intensive university. The findings were largely consistent with available research (showing influence of student gender, age, specialisation area, and final grade on SET completion). However, the study also identified additional influential course-specific factors such as term of study, course year level, and course type as statistically significant. Collectively, such findings point to substantively significant patterns of bias in the characteristics of the respondent pool. Further research is needed to specify and quantify the impact (if any) on SET scores.

Results indicated that the modeled predictors showed extremely low bias towards both teaching quality scores and response rate. Although the effect sizes of these results are extremely small, they are still significant due to the large sample size (comprising over 2000). The findings also suggest that contrary to common parlance in some quarters claiming students' unreliable ratings, this analysis has shown that students can judge teaching effectiveness and do not allow other teacher-, course- and student-related factors to bias their responses.

This effect held independent of degree of campus engagement, sex, student status (domestic or international), and generational status (students who were the first in their families to attend university, compared to those who were not). Given that over the course of their studies, students likely would have been exposed to a range of different behaviours on the part of their professors, it is argued that the propensity of a large number of students to give consistently low evaluations was a form of ""habitual behaviour.""",2015,,Canadian Journal of Higher Education,45,4,298-321,1773214289; EJ1086951,,,#868,Grayson 2015,"",""

The present research pulls together a substantial amount of data to statistically analyze several academic historical legends about just how vulnerable STEs are to the effects of: class size, course type, professor gender, and course grades. Design/methodology/approach: This research is utilizes over 30,000 individual student evaluations of 255 professors, spanning six semesters, during a three year time period to test six hypotheses. The final sample represents 1057 classes ranging in size between 10 and 190 students. Each hypothesis is statistically analyzed, with either analysis of variance or a Regression model. Findings: This study finds support for 5 out of 6 hypotheses. Specifically, these data suggest STEs are likely to be closest to ""5"" (using a 1-5 scale with 5 being highest) in small elective classes, and lowest in large required classes taught by females. As well we find support for the notion that higher expected course grades may lead to higher STEs. Practical implications: The practical significance of this research is important. First this research utilized a large data set spanning several years and hundreds of professors and thousands of students and rigorous statistical analysis to assert several important findings. Indeed STEs are impacted significantly by class type, class size, the gender of the professor and the expected course grade. With these findings we suggest a more comprehensive mechanism is in order for evaluation of teaching effectiveness. Social implications: This research could have great social implications if widely read across academic circles. Indeed the tail is wagging the dog; or the student is influencing teaching across America's universities. It is time to examine teaching effectiveness through a different lens, because using teaching evaluations to determine promotion and tenure, sparse bonus allocation, and teaching awards may be short sighted. Research limitations: While this research is statistically accurate, it is limited by the notion that the data was collected from one large area. As such, care should be taken in generalizing these results to other areas that may have different demographic composition, funding etc. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge this research is the first of its kind to statistically analyze such a large body of data and provide a useful guide to help evaluate professors utilizing what information is available.",2015,,International Journal of Higher Education,4,2,116-126,1697488026; EJ1060536,,,#871,Miles 2015,"",""
What Are the Causes of Educational Inequality and of Its Evolution over Time in Europe? Evidence from PISA,"Oppedisano, Veruska; Turati, Gilberto","This paper provides evidence on the sources of differences in inequality in educational scores and their evolution over time in four European countries. Using Programme for International Student Assessment data from the 2000 and the 2006 waves, the paper shows that inequality decreased in Germany and Spain (two ""decentralised"" schooling systems), whilst it increased in France and Italy (two ""centralised"" systems). The decomposition exercise shows that educational inequality not only does reflect the background related inequality, but also schools' characteristics especially. These characteristics are responsible for the observed evolution over time of inequality.",2015,,Education Economics,23,1,3-24,1651844759; EJ1047818,https://doi.org/10.1080/09645292.2012.736475,,#872,Oppedisano 2015,"",""

Assessment of Learning Styles of Undergraduate Medical Students Using the VARK Questionnaire and the Influence of Sex and Academic Performance,"Urval, Rathnakar P.; Kamath, Ashwin; Ullal, Sheetal; Shenoy, Ashok K.; Shenoy, Nandita; Udupa, Laxminarayana A.","While there are several tools to study learning styles of students, the visual-aural-read/write-kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire is a simple, freely available, easy to administer tool that encourages students to describe their behavior in a manner they can identify with and accept. The aim is to understand the preferred sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students, 83%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire. Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study had multiple learning preferences (68.7%). The predominant sensory modality of learning was aural (45.5%) and kinesthetic (33.1%). The learning style preference was not influenced by either sex or previous academic performance.

Although this is a very dismal level of performance when compared to other countries, for the native Qatari population even these low rankings are biased upward. This study shows that a major reason for overestimation of native academic performance in Qatar is the presence of a large foreign component in the student population. The bias persists even after controlling for demographic differences such as age, gender, grade and socioeconomic status.

The Effects of Gender on Group Work Process and Achievement: An Analysis through Self- and Peer-Assessment,"Takeda, Sachiko; Homberg, Fabian","The importance of teamwork skills as part of employability has been widely acknowledged and accompanied by active research on successful cooperative learning. However, relatively few studies have focused on the effects of gender on students' group work, and only a limited number of empirical studies exist that examine students' group work process and performance through the results of self- and peer-assessment. This study examines the effects of gender on group work process and performance using the self- and peer-assessment results of 1001 students in British higher education formed into 192 groups. The analysis aggregates all measures on the group level in order to examine the overall group performance. Further, a simple regression model is used to capture the effects of group gender compositions. Results suggest that students in gender balanced groups display enhanced collaboration in group work processes. The enhanced collaboration could be associated with less social loafing behaviours and more equitable contributions to the group work. However, the results imply that this cooperative learning environment does not lead to higher student performance. Students' comments allow us to explore possible reasons for this finding. The results also indicate underperformance by all-male groups and reduced collaborative behaviours by solo males in male gender exception groups (i.e., groups consisting of one male student and other members being female). The results thus have implications for the composition of groups. The pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed.",2014,,British Educational Research Journal,40,2,373-396,1651848427; EJ1023136,https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3088,,#877,Takeda 2014,"",""
Motivating and Supporting Young People to Study Mathematics: A London Perspective,"Mujtaba, Tamjid; Reiss, Mujtaba; Hodgson, Ann","This paper explores which classroom and teacher factors are associated with post-16 mathematics aspirations, mathematics intrinsic motivation, and mathematics self-concept. Few studies explore all three outcomes among the same set of students or make linkages across the factors that are important to these outcomes. The analysis is based on the survey responses of 761 Year 8 (age 13) and 715 Year 10 (age 15) students from 17 London schools as learners of mathematics. The analysis indicates that teaching for engagement is important for intrinsic mathematics motivation but not for future mathematics aspirations. In addition, students' emotional responses to mathematics lessons are important for their mathematics self-concept but not for future mathematics aspirations. Advice-pressure to continue with mathematics post-16, extrinsic material gain motivation, and mathematics self-concept underpin mathematics aspirations (even after controlling for the support students received from their families in mathematics attainment). The gender difference within mathematics self-concept among these young Londoners was higher than that found across England, although there were substantially fewer gender differences in relation to questions that explored students' perceptions of their mathematics lessons and teachers.

Attributional Gender Bias: Teachers' Ability and Effort Explanations for Students' Math Performance,"Espinoza, Penelope; ArÃªasÂ daÂ LuzÂ Fontes, Ana B.; Arms-Chavez, Clarissa J.","Research is presented on the attributional gender bias: the tendency to generate different attributions (explanations) for female versus male students' performance in math.

This bias has been shown in previous research to be committed by teachers, parents, and students themselves. The present work sought to investigate whether this bias among secondary school math teachers might be reduced over time through adoption of an incremental theory of intelligence. Findings revealed at baseline, teachers committed the expected bias in reference to their high-achieving students' math performance. Following exposure to stimuli, teachers in both experimental and control conditions reduced this bias. Unexpectedly, teachers across conditions showed a type of compensation for the bias by reversing stereotypical attributions for girls' and boys' successes and failures in math.

First-Year Students' Priorities and Choices in STEM Studies--IRIS Findings from Germany and Austria,"Elster, D.","IRIS (Interests and Recruitment in Science; http://iris.fp-7.org/about-iris/) is a European 7th framework project focusing on the challenge that only few young people in general, and women in particular, choose an education and career in science and technology. Project IRIS aims to contribute to the improvement of recruitment, retention and gender equity patterns in higher education. To acquire information about the factors that influence the educational choice of young people, a questionnaire was developed by the IRIS consortium. The IRIS questionnaire is based on the model of achievement-related choices (Eccles, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1999) and on the theory on the role of self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1997). These theories provide a framework for investigating the central aspects that influence an individual's educational choice.

Each of these significant relations was maintained when MPI, LPI or a composite of MPI and LPI served as the SET criterion. For example, the MPI-LPI composite correlated 0.28 with Agreeableness, 0.35 with CSE and -0.28 with Neuroticism. Similar correlations resulted for MPI and LPI. Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated that the CSE was an independent predictor of MPI ratings, Agreeableness was an independent predictor of LPI ratings, and both the CSE and Agreeableness were independent predictors of MPI-LPI composite ratings.

One hundred thirty participants (58.82%) engaged in 7Â days of EMA assessing self-reported momentary mood, stress, fatigue, bonding, and sleep. Data were analyzed using two-by-two ANOVAs and hierarchical linear modeling. Mothers of multiples reported more baseline parenting stress and less maternal-infant bonding than mothers of singletons (psâ<â.05). Mothers of multiples who were 6â12Â weeks postpartum reported the lowest bonding (pâ=â.03). Mothers of multiples also reported more momentary stress, overwhelm, nighttime awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset (psâ<â.05).

The impact of living with transfeminine vocal gender dysphoria: Health utility outcomes assessment,"Nuyen, Brian; Cherian Kandathil; McDonald, Daniella; Thomas, James; Most, Sam P","Background: The voice signals a tremendous amount of gender cues. Transfeminine individuals report debilitating quality-of-life deficits as a result of their vocal gender dysphoria.Aims: We aimed to quantify the potential impact of this dysphoria experienced with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as associated treatments, through validated health utility measures.Methods: Peri-operative phonometric audio recordings of a consented transfeminine patient volunteer with a history of vocal gender dysphoria aided in the description of two transfeminine health states, pre- and post-vocal feminization gender dysphoria; monocular and binocular blindness were health state controls. Survey responses from general population adults rate these four health states via visual analogue scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time tradeoff (TTO).Results: Survey respondents totaled 206 with a mean age of 35.8âyears. Through VAS measures, these general adult respondents on average perceived a year of life with transfeminine vocal gender dysphoria as approximately three-quarters of a life-year of perfect health. Respondents also on average would have risked a 15%â20% chance of death on SG analysis and would have sacrificed 10âyears of their remaining life on TTO measures to cure the condition. The QALY scores for the post-gender affirming treatments for vocal gender dysphoria (+0.09 VAS, pâ<â0.01) were significantly higher compared to the pretreatment state.

Pastoralist communities rely on their livestock for at least 50% of their food supply and source of income. Home births raise the risk of maternal morbidity and death, whereas institutional births lessen the likelihood of difficulties during labor. Around 70% of labors in pastoralist regions of Ethiopia were assisted by traditional birth attendants. Methods. Studies done from January 2004 to January 2023, accessed in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and other search engines, were included. PRISMA guidelines and JBI critical appraisal checklist were used to assure the quality of the review. Ten articles were included in this review. Data were extracted with Excel and exported to STATA 16 for analysis. Heterogeneity of literatures was evaluated using I2 statistics and publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and the Duval and Tweedie trim-fill analysis. Statistical significance was declared at p value less than 0.05. Result. The pooled estimate of institutional delivery among the pastoralist community in Ethiopia is 21.2% (95% CI: 16.2-26.1).

A Qualitative assessment of adolescent-parent sex talk in Ghana,"Agbeve, Anthony S; Fiaveh, Daniel Y; Anto-Ocrah, Martina","Young peopleâs views on sexuality in sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood. We know little about what they think of their sexual upbringing and how it influences their sexual and reproductive health decisions and behaviors. Guided by feminism and an intersectionality framework, the current study uses narratives from purposefully sampled adolescents and parents from rural households within Adaklu District, one of the eighteen districts in the Volta Region of Ghana, to examine parentsâ and young peopleâs perceptions of young adolescentsâ acquisition of sexuality knowledge, their sexual encounters and experiences, and the overall dynamics in educating young adolescents aged 16-19 years about sex. Specifically, we explored the types of sexuality issues parents discussed with their wards at home, and where appropriate, analyzed the inherent gender disparities in these discussions. Generally, parents agree that young people should know about sex. However, they emphasized that sexuality education should be age-specific and should be guided by cultural values and religious faith. Adolescentsâ exposure to multiple sources, including parental upbringing, the media, and information from peers, determines the extent they either engage or not engage in sexual activities. Parent-adolescent conversations were structured along gender lines, emphasizing adolescent girls' needs due to their perceived vulnerability compared to boys. While some of the findings support earlier views in terms of a very conservative, morally scripted way of training young people, it also suggests that young peopleâs sexual upbringing is not as repressive as previous studies would make it appear. Young people keep pushing the boundaries as they develop agencies to learn about sex from multiple sources. Therefore, policies seeking to promote young peopleâs sexual and reproductive rights in Ghana should pay close attention to what young people know about sex and how they know what they know, recognizing that their knowledge-seeking is part of human development and not inherently âbadâ.

Staff training can either enhance or impede successful program scale-up and implementation. In this paper, we evaluate the transfer of training to implementation sites (i.e., postsecondary institutions) using a train-the-trainer model.MethodsUsing pre- and post-training surveys and post-training interviews conducted from 2016 to 2020 with 33 implementation staff members from multiple sites, we answered the following research questions:1. Did the training meet its overall goal of preparing implementation staff?2. What training components were perceived to contribute to training effectiveness and implementation staff preparedness?ResultsResults suggested that our model of training was effective. Competence, confidence, and knowledge and ability increased significantly after training, and most staff perceived the training to be highly useful and effective (especially for preparing them to address EAAA participant issues). Practice and feedback from trainers through active learning techniques were especially important. Although implementation staff reported being well prepared to deliver the training or program, they reported being less prepared for handling other implementation-related activities and issues (that the training was not necessarily designed to address in-depth).ConclusionsOur findings suggest a need to enhance existing training on self-care and supporting program facilitators and for ongoing support and reminders from program purveyors to ensure that implementers are making use of existing resources.

Objectives:  This study aimed to describe (1) daily exposure to self-reported stress levels during pregnancy, and (2) sources of stress among participants that identified as Black or White using data collected via ecological momentary assessment.  Methods:  We leveraged survey data from the Postpartum Mothers Mobile Study, a prospective longitudinal study using ecological momentary assessment data collection methods to describe patterns of stress during pregnancy. This article is descriptive and documents patterns of self-reported stress levels and sources of stress. Frequencies and percentages of stress responses were computed to describe these patterns.  Results:  The sample (nâ=â296) was 27% Black (nâ=â78) and 63% White (nâ=â184). Results were based on at least one measurement of that stress level during pregnancy. A similar number of Black and White participants reported no stress during pregnancy. White (85%â95%) and Black (60%â70%) participants reported low to moderate levels of stress. Black participants (38%) and White participants (35%) reported experiencing high stress. Black and White participants reported similar sources of stress: stress from a partner, too many things to do, a baby or other children, and financial concerns. White participants reported work as a top stressor, and Black participants reported financial issues as a top source of stress.  Conclusion:  This study provides insight into daily exposure to stress that has implications for maternal health. We described patterns of self-reported stress and sources of stress among Black and White participants. The daily exposures to stress reported by this sample exist within a context of root causes of structural inequities in education, health care, income, wealth, and housing that must be addressed to achieve maternal health equity.",2022,,Women's Health,18,,,2758568340,https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057221126808,,#907,OmowaleSerwaa 2022,"",""

Currently, higher education is important in the training of highly qualified specialists, the creation of new knowledge, and the introduction of innovations. Objectives. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the indicators characterizing the gender structure of scientific and pedagogical personnel in higher educational institutions of various countries. These indicators were the share of female teachers in the total number of teachers of higher educational institutions. Methodology. We used data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics for 107 countries. We used the density functions of the normal distribution as models. Results. The results of the computational experiment showed that the share of female teaching staff in the number of scientific and pedagogical staff on average in the countries under consideration was 41.6%.

In addition to traditional segmentation along race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, many GBM also identify with sexual subcultural communities. Previous research has shown differences across a variety of health outcomes between these sexual subcultural communities. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HIV prevention practices among GBM differed according to sexual subcultural community. The study was conducted in collaboration with a popular social and sexual networking smartphone application company. A total of 23,577Â GBM responded to the survey. A latent class analysis identified 6 distinct classes related to sexual subcultural community identification. We found significant differences across sociodemographic characteristics, HIV prevention practices, and condomless anal sex in the past 6Â months related to sexual subculture identification. Findings suggest that sexual subcultural identity is related to decision-making around HIV prevention among GBM. Differences in HIV prevention strategies are likely a function of group norms, unique shared experiences among GBM identifying with a particular sexual subculture community, and sociodemographic characteristics associated with these groups. As such, sexual subculture identity should be considered in developing interventions and social marketing campaigns to increase uptake of biomedical HIV prevention tools among GBM.

Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others.

"Evaluation of Knowledge and Practice of Pharmacy Professionals regarding the Risk of Medication Use during Pregnancy in Dessie Town, Northeast Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study","Tuha, Abdu; Gurbie, Yilak; Hailu, Haftom Gebregergs","Background. The developing organism is unique in its responsiveness to drugs and predictability of therapeutic effectiveness based on the adult which can lead to grave consequences in the neonate and child. Moreover, uncertainty about the risks of drug use in pregnancy could result in restrictive attitudes towards prescribing and dispensing medicines and their use. Pharmacists have huge duties to improve medication use, especially among pregnant women. The objective of this study is, hence, to assess the knowledge and practice of pharmacy professionals (PPs) towards the risk of medication use during pregnancy. Methodology. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out over practicing community and hospital pharmacy professionals in Dessie town. They were asked about the safety of common drugs during pregnancy. It involves both prescription-only medications (POM) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Secondly, they were asked about their practice towards the risk of medication use during pregnancy. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were utilized. For descriptive analysis, results were expressed as numbers, percentages, and mean (Â± SD and 95% CI). Result. Seventy-six pharmacy professionals in Dessie, Northeast Ethiopia, took part in the study. Most of the respondents (64.5%) believed that amoxicillin is safe in all trimesters. 26 (34.2%) of participants knew that isotretinoin is unsafe for use by pregnant women. About dietary supplements, 32.9% of PPs reported that Vitamin A supplements are safe in all trimesters. There was a significant difference observed for study college and years of experience of the PPs in their score of knowledge test (p=0.020 and p=0.024, respectively). Additionally, there was a difference seen for gender (p=0.030), study college (p=0.036), and working institution (p=0.013) in their advice to pregnant women. Conclusion and Recommendation. Overall, PPs exhibited very low knowledge about drug safety during pregnancy.

A Preliminary Assessment of Selected Social Determinants of Health in a Sample of Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals in Puerto Rico,"Martinez-Velez, Jose J; Melin, Kyle; Rodriguez-Diaz, Carlos E","Purpose: Transgender and gender nonconforming (GNC) people continue to experience suboptimal health care, social exclusion, and lower quality of life. Globally, lack of access to services, institutional violence, and public harassment have been reported. However, there is limited data on transgender health in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. The purpose of this study is to assess the social determinants of health and wellbeing of transgender and GNC people living in Puerto Rico.Methods: Utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, 52 self-identified transgender and GNC individuals living in Puerto Rico completed a survey, which included questions on access to health care services, social support, and violence, among others. Data were collected from March to Ma y of 2015 and descriptive statistical analysis was conducted.Results: Most of the participants reported experiences of discrimination across multiple social settings, most commonly at school (70.6%) and work (67.4%). Regarding experiences of violence, more than half (65.4%) had been verbally attacked in a public space. Many reported that access to gender-affirming health care services is difficult in Puerto Rico (88.5%) due to lack of knowledgeable providers (59.6%) and discomfort during the encounter (55.8%). The main perceived priority for their wellbeing was a transgender health care center.Conclusion: Although the LGBT equality movement has reached great milestones, access to gender-affirming health services and safe educational and work spaces are still needed.

Evaluation of sex- and gender-based medicine training in post-graduate medical education: a cross-sectional survey study,"Kling, Juliana M; Rose, Steven H; Kransdorf, Lisa N; Viggiano, Thomas R; Miller, Virginia M","BackgroundAddressing healthcare disparities is a national priority for initiatives in precision and individualized medicine. An essential component of precision medicine is the understanding that sex and gender influence health and disease. Whether these issues are addressed in post-graduate medical education curricula is unknown.MethodsA questionnaire was designed and administered to residents across the Mayo Clinic enterprise to assess current knowledge of sex and gender medicine in a large program of post-graduate medical education and to identify barriers and preferred teaching methods for addressing sex and gender issues in health and disease. Descriptive and qualitative thematic analyses of the survey responses were compiled and analyzed.ResultsResponses were collected from 271 residents (response rate 17.2 %; 54 % female; 46 % male). A broad cross-section of training programs on all Mayo Clinic campuses (Arizona, Minnesota, and Florida) was represented. Sixteen percent of the respondents reported they had never had an instructor or preceptor discuss how a patient's sex or gender impacted their care of a patient; 55 % said this happened only occasionally. Of medical knowledge questions about established sex- and gender-related differences, 48 % were answered incorrectly or ""unsure."" Qualitative thematic analysis showed that many trainees do not understand the potential impact of sex and gender on their clinical practice and/or believe it does not pertain to their specialty. A higher percentage of female participants agreed it was important to consider a patient's sex and gender when providing patient care (60.4 vs. 38.7 %, p =  0.02), and more male than female participants had participated in research that included sex and/or gender as a variable (59.6 vs. 39.0 %, p < 0.01).ConclusionsCurriculum gaps exist in post-graduate medical training regarding sex- and gender-based medicine, and residents often do not fully understand how these concepts impact their patients' care. Reviewing the definition of sex- and gender-based medicine and integrating these concepts into existing curricula can help close these knowledge gaps.

"The Stereotype Threat Hypothesis: An Assessment from the Philosopher's Armchair, for the Philosopher's Classroom","Schouten, Gina","According to Stereotype Threat Hypothesis (STH), fear of confirming gendered stereotypes causes women to experience anxiety in circumstances wherein their performance might potentially confirm those stereotypes, such as high-stakes testing scenarios in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses. This anxiety causes women to underperform, which in turn causes them to withdraw from math-intensive disciplines. STH is thought by many to account for the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, and a growing body of evidence substantiates this hypothesis. In considering the plausibility of STH as an explanation for women's disproportionate attrition from undergraduate philosophy programs, one is struck by dissimilarities between STEM and philosophy that appear to undermine the applicability of STH to the latter. In this paper, I argue that these dissimilarities are either merely apparent or merely apparently relevant to the plausibility of STH as an explanation for gender disparities in philosophy. I argue further that, if research from STEM uncovers promising strategies for confronting stereotype threat, we should think about how to apply those strategies in our introductory philosophy classrooms.",2015,,Hypatia,30,2,450,1678885163,https://doi.org/10.1111/hypa.12148,,#932,Schouten 2015,"",""

Additionally, there are currently no measures available to assess students' consent to sex. The current study aimed to better understand college students consent by using a systematic approach to develop validated measures of sexual consent. This study integrated mixed methods via three phases and two waves of data collection to develop two measures of consent. In Phase 1, qualitative data were collected from college students (n = 185) to inform the design of quantitative measures aimed at assessing sexual consent at last sexual intercourse. In Phase 2, items were written for the closed-ended quantitative instrument and reviewed by a team of experts, educators, and clinicians. In Phase 3, a quantitative survey was administered to college students (n = 660) which included the measures of consent developed from the Phase 1 data; the measures were assessed for their psychometric properties. Exploratory factor analyses were utilized to assess the measures and resulted in five factors each for both consent scales. Both scales had high internal consistency reliability, showed gender differences, and showed differences across relationship status (single vs. in a relationship). The two newly developed measures assess unique constructs of consent and demonstrate assessments of specific concepts.

This world fails to accommodate adequately the needs and experiences of women: no more evident than in the transport sector, where a âdefault maleâ perspective dominates the planning and policies that shape our roads, railways, airlines, and shipping. This paper argues that the ways in which masculinity infuses transport systems mean they are integral to debates on gender and work. They impact both the way women experience travel and their access to places of work. A multi-transport domain scoping study has been conducted to review the literature for key gender factors that influence the use of road, rail, aviation, and maritime transport modes.

Can mixed assessment methods make biology classes more equitable?,"Cotner, Sehoya; Ballen, Cissy J.","Many factors have been proposed to explain the attrition of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields, among them the lower performance of women in introductory courses resulting from deficits in incoming preparation. We focus on the impact of mixed methods of assessment, which minimizes the impact of high-stakes exams and rewards other methods of assessment such as group participation, low-stakes quizzes and assignments, and in-class activities. We hypothesized that these mixed methods would benefit individuals who otherwise underperform on high-stakes tests. Here, we analyze gender-based performance trends in nine large (N > 1000 students) introductory biology courses in fall 2016. Females underperformed on exams compared to their male counterparts, a difference that does not exist with other methods of assessment that compose course grade. Further, we analyzed three case studies of courses that transitioned their grading schemes to either de-emphasize or emphasize exams as a proportion of total course grade. We demonstrate that the shift away from an exam emphasis consequently benefits female students, thereby closing gaps in overall performance. Further, the exam performance gap itself is reduced when the exams contribute less to overall course grade. We discuss testable predictions that follow from our hypothesis, and advocate for the use of mixed methods of assessments (possibly as part of an overall shift to active learning techniques). We conclude by challenging the student deficit model, and suggest a course deficit model as explanatory of these performance gaps, whereby the microclimate of the classroom can either raise or lower barriers to success for underrepresented groups in STEM.

Our results showed that when stereotype threat was primed in high school students (n = 244), there was no relationship between their performance on an academic test (the SweSAT) and their assessment of their performance (how well they did), whereas in a non-stereotype threat condition, there was a medium-sized relationship.

There were no differences between men and women in the remaining factors: 'quality of relationships with the management,' 'quality of relationships with colleagues,' and 'quality of the physical environment.' Conclusions: The use of bifactor modeling to establish the cross-validity of the WOAQ across male and female paramedics adds to evidence for the measureâs good psychometric properties.

Differences in words used to describe racial and gender groups in Medical Student Performance Evaluations,"Ross, David A.; Boatright, Dowin; Nunez-Smith, Marcella; Jordan, Ayana; Chekroud, Adam; Moore, Edward Z.","Purpose: The transition from medical school to residency is a critical step in the careers of physicians. Because of the standardized application processâwhere in schools submit summative Medical Student Performance Evaluations (MSPE's)âit also represents a unique opportunity to assess the possible prevalence of racial and gender disparities, as shown elsewhere in medicine. Method: The authors conducted textual analysis of MSPE's from 6,000 US students applying to 16 residency programs at a single institution in 2014-15. They used custom software to extract demographic data and keyword frequency from each MSPE. The main outcome measure was the proportion of applicants described using 24 pre-determined words from four thematic categories ('standout traits', 'ability' 'grindstone habits', and 'compassion'). Results: The data showed significant differences based on race and gender. White applicants were more likely to be described using 'standout' or 'ability' keywords (including 'exceptional', 'best', and 'outstanding') while Black applicants were more likely to be described as 'competent'. These differences remained significant after controlling for United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores. Female applicants were more frequently described as 'caring', 'compassionate', and 'empathic' or 'empathetic'. Women were also more frequently described as 'bright' and 'organized'. Conclusions: While the MSPE is intended to reflect an objective, summative assessment of students' qualifications, these data demonstrate for the first time systematic differences in how candidates are described based on racial/ethnic and gender group membership. Recognizing possible implicit biases and their potential impact is important for faculty who strive to create a more egalitarian medical community.

Do preservice teachersâ judgments and judgment accuracy depend on studentsâ characteristics?

Besides studentsâ actual performance, studentsâ group characteristics (e.g., gender or immigration background) may effect teachersâ judgments. In addition, judgment accuracy might be different for various student groups. We conducted an online study of 168 preservice teachers. We presented within a virtual classroom mathematics test results of 12 fictitious second-grade students who differed in their actual performance in a mathematical test, immigration background, and gender. Preservice teachers made a judgment about the studentsâ current performance. Studentsâ actual performance, immigration background, and gender showed statistically significant main effects on the judgment. Students with (vs. without) an immigration background and female (vs. male) students were evaluated less favorably. These effects were qualified by a statistically significant three-way interaction between actual performance, immigration background, and gender. The joint examination of student characteristics in terms of judgment accuracy shows that it is precisely the interaction of student characteristics that makes a difference: female students with and without an immigration background as well as students without an immigration background are assessed more accurately, while male students with an immigration background are assessed significantly more inaccurately. In sum, the judgment made by preservice teachers about studentsâ performance differed in terms of student characteristics that were unrelated to performance such as immigration background and gender in addition to differing on performance-related variables.

Gender and socioeconomic related differences in performance based ICT competences,"Aesaert, Koen; van Braak, Johan","In the past, several studies have investigated the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status on the one hand, and students' ICT competences on the other. In this research field, two problems seem to occur. First, research findings are inconclusive. Second, most studies are conducted from the perspective of self-perceived ICT competence. Such measures suffer from self-reported bias, as they depend on students' own judgment of their ICT competences. This study aims to tackle both these problems. First, the outline of the design of a computer and performance-based assessment test that measures primary school students' ICT competences in a direct and valid way is presented. Second, the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status, and the students' results on the test i.e. their actual ICT competences was investigated. The performance-based test was administered to a representative sample of 378 sixth-grade students of 58 primary schools. The results of this study indicate that primary school students in general have particular difficulties in higher-order ICT competences that focus on communicating in a socially acceptable and clearly understandable way. Moreover, results show that girls have better technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences than boys. With regard to socioeconomic status, results show that the educational level of the mother is positively related to both students' technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences.

Gender inequality at home is associated with poorer health for women,"Eek, Frida; Axmon, Anna","Background: As more women have joined the work force, the difference in employment rate between men and women has decreased, in Sweden as well as many other countries. Despite this, traditional gender patterns regarding, for example, responsibility for household duties still remain. Women are on sick leave more often than men, and previous studies have indicated that an unequal split of household responsibilities and perceived gender inequality could be associated with negative health outcomes. Aims: The aim of the present study was to explore whether an unequal distribution of responsibilities in the home was related to various health related outcomes among women. Methods: A sample consisting of 837 women living in a relationship, and working at least 50% of full time, responded to a questionnaire including information about division of responsibilities at home as well as various psychological and physiological health related outcomes. Results: The results showed that women living in relationships with perceived more unequal distribution of responsibility for house hold duties showed significantly higher levels of perceived stress, fatigue, physical/psychosomatic symptoms, and work family conflict compared with women living in more equal relationships. They also had significantly increased odds for insufficient time for various forms of recovery, which may further contribute to an increased risk of poor health. Conclusions: Although an increasing employment rate among women is valuable for both society and individuals, it is important to work towards greater gender equality at home to maintain this development without it having a negative effect on womenâs health and well-being.

This study investigates sex differences in neuropsychological performance among individuals without dementia at baseline. METHODS: Neuropsychological assessment data, both standard test scores and process coded responses, from Framingham Heart Study participants were analyzed for sex differences using regression model and Cox proportional hazards model. Optimal NP profiles were identified by machine learning methods for men and women. RESULTS: Sex differences were observed in both summary scores and composite process scores of NP tests in terms of adjusted means and their associations with AD incidence. The optimal NP profiles for men and women have 10 and 8 measures, respectively, and achieve 0.76 mean area under the curve for AD prediction.

No sex differences in neuropsychological performance in first episode psychosis patients,"Ayesa-Arriola, Rosa; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose Manuel; Gomez-Ruiz, Elsa; Roiz-SantiÃ¡Ã±ez, Roberto; Reeves, Lauren L.; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto","Objective: The purpose of this study was to verify whether male patients with psychosis have greater neurocognitive impairment than female patients at illness onset. Method: Participants with a first episode of psychosis (74 women/86 men) and healthy controls (62 women/97 men) were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: Women in the clinical group were older at illness onset and had achieved higher formal education than men. This trend was the same for the control group. The patient group presented with lower premorbid IQ compared to healthy controls, and performed below for most neuropsychological tests. Women scored higher than men on a test of verbal memory, whereas men scored higher than women on a test of reaction time, visual memory, and a planning task. There were no group-by-sex interactions for any of the neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The present study shows that at the onset of psychosis there are no differences between males and females in neuropsychological performance. The differential pattern of cognitive performance observed is similar to that in healthy males and females. Furthermore, females with a late onset of psychosis may represent a subgroup with specific visuospatial and problem solving impairments. Significant outcomes: 1- The present study does not give support to the hypothesis that male have worse neurocognitive functioning than female patients at illness onset. 2- The neuropsychological profile of sex differences observed among patients is consistent with that observed among controls. 3- We identified a subgroup of female patients with late onset that differed in their degree and pattern of cognitive impairment with regard to their male counterparts. Limitations: 1- Factors other than neurocognitive functioning may underlie the more severe impairment observed in the onset and course of illness in men. 2- Although the study used a broad battery of well established tests, this battery may lack sensitivity to detect sex differences. 3- A longitudinal study is required to further explore whether sex specific deficits require special rehabilitation programs for patients with schizophrenia.

Relationships between demographic characteristics of shelter dogs and performance on tests of a behavioral evaluation and between performance and adoption success,"McGuire, Betty; Jean-Baptiste, Kennedy","Dog behavior has been studied using diverse methods, including owner-completed questionnaires, records from veterinary clinics that evaluate behavioral problems, and test batteries such as those used by some animal shelters. Measures of prevalence for multiple behavioral issues and analyses of whether dog demographic characteristics are associated with problematic behaviors are commonly reported in studies using questionnaires and clinical records; however, these measures are infrequently reported for all tests and subtests in studies using data from shelter behavioral evaluations. In this study, we determined prevalence of both concerning and dangerous behaviors on 12 tests and subtests of a canine behavioral evaluation by analyzing data collected by the behavioral staff at a NY shelter (n = 1,104 dogs tested between 2014 and 2019). We also examined whether behavior on four tests and subtests with prevalence over 10% (two Sociability subtests, Handling test, and Dog-to-dog meeting subtest) was associated with likelihood of being returned to the shelter post-adoption, and whether dog demographic characteristics (age, sex, reproductive status, and body size) were associated with behaviors on tests and subtests. Of all dogs tested, prevalence measures of dangerous behaviors were always less than 5%. Our measures of prevalence (concerning and dangerous behaviors combined) for food guarding (15.5%), stranger-directed aggression (6.5%), and dog-directed aggression (16.7%) were generally similar to those reported for dogs in other shelters and in homes. For the four tests/subtests examined here, displaying concerning or dangerous behavior was not significantly associated with return to the shelter, and positive predictive values (PPV) were low, which implies that many positive tests will be false positives. We also found few significant associations between demographic characteristics and behavior on tests and subtests and PPV were low. Other factors, such as previous experiences with people and dogs, as well as underlying physiological and neurobiological processes, may be more important influences on a dogâs behavior during a shelter behavioral evaluation than general demographic characteristics. Total number of tests and subtests out of a possible 12 on which dogs were assessed as showing concerning or dangerous behaviors ranged from zero to 7 per dog (median, 0; mean, 0.82). In summary, poor predictive abilities characterized associations between performance on certain tests/subtests of the behavioral evaluation and return to the shelter and between demographic characteristics and behavior on test/subtests. Our data may contribute to the ongoing debate about the usefulness of canine behavioral evaluations in shelters.

Sex differences in the subjective effects of oral Îâ¹-THC in cannabis users,"Fogel, Jessica S.; Kelly, Thomas H.; Westgate, Philip M.; Lile, Joshua A.","Previous studies suggest that there are sex differences in endocannabinoid function and the response to exogenous cannabinoids, though data from clinical studies comparing acute cannabinoid effects in men and women under controlled laboratory conditions are limited. To further explore these potential differences, data from 30 cannabis users (N = 18 M, 12 F) who completed previous Îâ¹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Îâ¹-THC) discrimination studies were combined for this retrospective analysis. In each study, subjects learned to discriminate between oral Îâ¹-THC and placebo and then received a range of Îâ¹-THC doses (0, 5, 15 and a 'high' dose of either 25 or 30 mg). Responses on a drug-discrimination task, subjective effects questionnaire, psychomotor performance tasks, and physiological measures were assessed. Îâ¹-THC dose-dependently increased drug-appropriate responding, ratings on 'positive' Visual Analog Scale (VAS) items (e.g., good effects, like drug, take again), and items related to intoxication (e.g., high, stoned). Îâ¹-THC also dose-dependently impaired performance on psychomotor tasks and elevated heart rate. Sex differences on VAS items emerged as a function of dose. Women exhibited significantly greater subjective responses to oral drug administration than men at the 5 mg Îâ¹-THC dose, whereas men were more sensitive to the subjective effects of the 15 mg dose of Îâ¹-THC than women. These results demonstrate dose-dependent separation in the subjective response to oral Îâ¹-THC administration by sex, which might contribute to the differential development of problematic cannabis use.

Objectives: To determine the effects of work-related concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (wr-mTBI) on perceptions of refreshing sleep in workers with an injury and to identify the relevant factors responsible for sleep changes. Methods: We studied post-concussive changes in sleep in 66 adults (50% male workers, 42% aged 30â50 years, median post-injury days: 155) who had sustained wr-mTBI and experienced functional limitations long after the injury.

Taking the time: The implications of workplace assessment for organizational gender inequality,"Nelson, Laura K.; Brewer, Alexandra; Mueller, Anna S.; O'Connor, Daniel M.; Dayal, Arjun; Arora, Vineet M.","Gendered differences in workload distribution, in particular who spends time on low-promotability workplace tasksâtasks that are essential for organizations yet do not typically lead to promotionsâcontribute to persistent gender inequalities in workplaces. We examined how gender is implicated in the content, quality, and consequences of one low-promotability workplace task: assessment. By analyzing real-world behavioral data that include 33,456 in-the-moment numerical and textual evaluations of 359 resident physicians (subordinates) by 285 attending physicians (superordinates) in eight U.S. hospitals, and by combining qualitative methods and machine learning, we found that, compared to men, women attendings wrote more words in their comments to residents, used more job-related terms, and were more likely to provide helpful feedback, particularly when residents were struggling. Additionally, we found women residents were less likely to receive substantive evaluations, regardless of attending gender. Our findings suggest that workplace assessment is gendered in three ways: women (superordinates) spend more time on this low-promotability task, they are more cognitively engaged with assessment, and women (subordinates) are less likely to fully benefit from quality assessment. We conclude that workplaces would benefit from addressing pervasive inequalities hidden within workplace assessment, equalizing not only who provides this assessment work, but who does it well and equitably.

The validity of three new driving simulator scenarios: Detecting differences in driving performance by difficulty and driver gender and age,"Maxwell, Hillary; Weaver, Bruce; Gagnon, Sylvain; Marshall, Shawn; BÃ©dard, Michel","Objective: We explored the convergent and discriminant validity of three driving simulation scenarios by comparing behaviors across gender and age groups, considering what we know about on-road driving. Background: Driving simulators offer a number of benefits, yet their use in real-world driver assessment is rare. More evidence is needed to support their use. Method: A total of 104 participants completed a series of increasingly difficult driving simulation scenarios. Linear mixed models were estimated to determine if behaviors changed with increasing difficulty and whether outcomes varied by age and gender, thereby demonstrating convergent and discriminant validity, respectively. Results: Drivers adapted velocity, steering, acceleration, and gap acceptance according to difficulty, and the degree of adaptation differed by gender and age for some outcomes. For example, in a construction zone scenario, drivers reduced their mean velocities as congestion increased; males drove an average of 2.30 km/hr faster than females, and older participants drove more slowly than young (5.26 km/hr) and middle-aged drivers (6.59 km/hr). There was also an interaction between age and difficulty; older drivers did not reduce their velocities with increased difficulty. Conclusion: This study provides further support for the ability of driving simulators to elicit behaviors similar to those seen in on-road driving and to differentiate between groups, suggesting that simulators could serve a supportive role in fitness-to-drive evaluations. Application: Simulators have the potential to support driver assessment. However, this depends on the development of valid scenarios to benchmark safe driving behavior, and thereby identify deviations from safe driving behavior. The information gained through simulation may supplement other forms of assessment and possibly eliminate the need for on-road testing in some situations.

With this study, we draw on role expectations theory to understand how inequality in assessment emerges as individuals transition from student to professional roles. To do this, we leverage the case of medical residency so that we can examine how changes in role expectations shape assessment while holding occupation and organization constant. By analyzing a dataset of 2,765 performance evaluations from a three-year emergency medicine training program, we empirically demonstrate that women and men are reviewed as equally capable at the beginning of residency, when the student role dominates; however, in year three, when the colleague role dominates, men are perceived as outperforming women. Furthermore, when we hold resident performance somewhat constant by comparing feedback to medical errors of similar severity, we find that in the third year of residency, but not the first, women receive more harsh criticism and less supportive feedback than men. Ultimately, this study suggests that role expectations, and the implicit biases they can trigger, matter significantly to the production of gender inequality, even when holding organization, occupation, and resident performance constant.

Wage formation and gender wage gaps: is there a role for job-task evaluation schemes?,"Asplund, R; Lilja, R","Purpose - Both academia and policymakers express a strong belief in higher average education levels exerting a narrowing impact on wage inequality in general and gender wage gaps in particular. The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize whether or not this effect extends to R&D- and export-intensive branches such as the technology industry.Design/methodology/approach - In exploring the impact of individual and job-related background factors and, especially, of job-task evaluation schemes on the size and change in gender wage gaps in the technology industry, the paper applies an elaborated decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression techniques.Findings - While changes in standard human capital endowments can explain little, if anything, of the growth in real wages or the widening of wage dispersion among the Finnish technology industry's white-collar workers, a new job-task evaluation scheme introduced in 2002 seems to have succeeded, at least in part, to make the wage-setting process more transparent by re-allocating especially the technology industry's female white-collar workers in a way that better reflects their skills, efforts and responsibilities.Practical implications - One crucial implication of this finding is that improving the standard human capital of women closer to that of men will not suffice to narrow the gender wage gap in the advanced parts of the economy and, hence, not also the overall gender wage gap. The reason is obvious: concomitant with rising average education levels, other skill aspects have received increasing attention in working life. Consequently, a conscious combination of formal and informal competencies as laid down in well-designed job-task evaluation schemes may, in many instances, offer a more powerful path for tackling the gender wage gap.Originality/value - While the existing evidence on the impact of performance-related pay on gender wage gaps is still scarce but growing the authors know of no empirical studies analyzing the gender pay-gap effect of job-task evaluation systems.",2014,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER,35,3,267-290,WOS:000341870100004,10.1108/IJM-04-2014-0091,,#957,Asplund 2014,"",""

Promotion of Women Physicians in Academic Medicine,"Nocco, SE; Larson, AR","Women currently represent nearly half of all medical school graduates and assistant professors at academic institutions. Despite the large pool of women in the academic medicine pipeline, relatively few ascend to top leadership positions and women remain grossly underrepresented among full professors, permanent department chairs, and highest-level deans/interim deans. Considerable evidence suggests that the gender imbalance observed at the top tiers of academic medicine is, in part, due to gender differences in promotional rates, with women being promoted more slowly than their male colleagues. The well-documented gender gaps in publications, grant support, recognition awards, speaker invitations, and leadership positions contribute to the slow progression of women in medicine, as promotions committees rely heavily upon these traditional measures of academic success to select candidates for career advancement. Additionally, implicit biases, which have been shown to favor men over women in science and leadership, influence decision-making processes relevant to the promotion of women in academia. With the large number of highly qualified women entering medicine, it is imperative that organizations, academic institutions, and leaders in the medical community address the systemic inequities that are preventing half the workforce from reaching its full potential.",2021,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,30,6,864-871,WOS:000533287400001,10.1089/jwh.2019.7992,,#959,Nocco 2021,"",""
The Impact of Faculty Gender on Resident Evaluations of Faculty Performance in Emergency Medicine,"Beaulieu, AM; Hunold, KM; Mitzman, J; Li-Sauerwine, S","Introduction: Gender bias impacts the promotion and tenure of female emergency medicine (EM) physicians and limits their ability to advance in academic rank. Many factors influence the promotion and tenure process including research, evaluations, opportunities for leadership, sponsorship, and mentorship. The goal of this study is to determine if resident evaluations of EM faculty differ by faculty gender. Methods: A quantitative analysis was used to examine 14,613 teaching evaluations of faculty by residents at a single academic center (The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus) in the years 20172019. Anonymized ratings of male and female faculty on a five -point Likert scale were compared using Fischer's exact test and adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: Male faculty were more likely to hold the rank of Associate Professor or Professor. When taking both faculty gender and rank into account, male Clinical Instructors and Assistant Professors had significantly higher evaluation scores by residents in the domain of resident autonomy than their female counterparts. Regardless of gender or faculty rank, the majority of faculty received scores greater than four. Conclusion: A significant gender difference was found in resident evaluation scores of faculty in the domain of resident autonomy at the level of Clinical Instructor and Assistant Professor. Resident autonomy refers to the degree of supervision by faculty which evolves over time and is primarily based on level of training. This is important as it demonstrates a gender difference in scores that could be used to determine faculty compensation and promotion. Evaluation tools used for promotion and tenure of academic faculty should be evaluated for implicit bias and appropriate statistical analysis.",2024,,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,16,3,,WOS:001222539400016,10.7759/cureus.56814,,#960,Beaulieu 2024,"",""

Examining gender bias in the feedback shared with family medicine residents,"Loeppky, C; Babenko, O; Ross, S","Objectives: Competency-based education places increasing emphasis on formative feedback to learners as part of the assessment process. We wished to determine if gender bias was present in the feedback shared with post-graduate medical trainees (residents) in a two-year family medicine residency program at a Canadian university.Methods: We performed secondary data analyses of documented feedback (FieldNotes) extracted from the Competency-Based Achievement System database. Between 2012 and 2016, 464 preceptors (188 female (F); 276 male (M)) wrote in total 7316 FieldNotes for 192 residents (104 F; 88 M), forming four gender dyads. Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends in FieldNotes frequencies, competencies (Sentinel Habits; SH), progress levels (PL), and the use of adjectives (agentic/competency-based; communal/warmth-based) by preceptors in the FieldNotes.Results: Male and female preceptors wrote on average 7 and 14 FieldNotes, respectively. Female residents received on average more feedback comments from female preceptors (7 notes) than from male preceptors (4 notes). The M-M and M-F resident-preceptor dyads had, respectively, the least and the most 'Stop, Important correction' FieldNotes in both the PGY1 and PGY2 groups. Although preceptors used agentic adjectives more frequently than communal adjectives overall, the F-M resident-preceptor dyad contained the highest proportion of communal adjectives and the lowest proportion of agentic adjectives.Conclusions: Residents would benefit from multiple opportunities for feedback from both male and female preceptors throughout their residency training.

The National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) R01 award is the ""gold standard"" of an independent research program. Studies show inconsistencies in R01 reviewers' scoring and in award outcomes for certain applicant groups. Consistent with the NIH recommendation to examine potential bias in R01 peer review, the authors performed a text analysis of R01 reviewers' critiques.MethodThe authors collected 454 critiques (262 from 91 unfunded and 192 from 67 funded applications) from 67 of 76 (88%) R01 investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with initially unfunded applications subsequently funded between December 2007 and May 2009. To analyze critiques, the authors developed positive and negative grant application evaluation word categories and selected five existing categories relevant to grant review. They analyzed results with linear mixed-effects models for differences due to applicant and application characteristics.ResultsCritiques of funded applications contained more positive descriptors and superlatives and fewer negative evaluation words than critiques of unfunded applications. Experienced investigators' critiques contained more references to competence. Critiques showed differences due to applicant sex despite similar application scores or funding outcomes: more praise for applications from female investigators, greater reference to competence/ability for funded applications from female experienced investigators, and more negative evaluation words for applications from male investigators (all P < .05).ConclusionsResults suggest that text analysis is a promising tool for assessing consistency in R01 reviewers' judgments, and gender stereotypes may operate in R01 review.",2015,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,90,1,69-75,WOS:000347076300020,10.1097/ACM.0000000000000442,,#965,Kaatz 2015,"",""
Gender Disparities in Electronic Health Record Usage and Inbasket Burden for Internal Medicine Residents,"Liddell, SS; Tomasi, AG; Halvorsen, AJ; Stelling, BEV; Leasure, EL","BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated patients hold different expectations for female physicians compared to male physicians, including higher expectations for patient-centered communication and addressing socioeconomic or emotional needs. Recent evidence indicates this gender disparity extends to the electronic health record (EHR). Similar studies have not been conducted with resident physicians. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to characterize differences in EHR workload for female resident physicians compared to male resident physicians. DESIGN: This study evaluated 12 months of 156 Mayo Clinic internal medicine residents' inbasket data from July 2020 to June 2021 using Epic's Signal and Physician Efficiency Profile (PEP) data. Excel, BlueSky Statistics, and SAS analytical software were used for analysis. Paired t-tests and analysis of variance were used to compare PEP data by gender and postgraduate year (PGY). ""Male"" and ""female"" were used in substitute for ""gender"" as is precedent in the literature. SUBJECTS: Mayo Clinic internal medicine residents. MAIN MEASURES: Total time spent in EHR per day; time in inbasket and notes per day; time in notes per appointment; number of patient advice requests made through the portal; message turnaround time. KEY RESULTS: Female residents received more patient advice requests per year (p = 0.004) with an average of 86.7 compared to 68, resulting in 34% more patient advice requests per day worked (p < 0.001). Female residents spent more time in inbasket per day (p = 0.002), in notes per day (p < 0.001), and in notes per appointment (p = 0.001). Resident panel comparisons revealed equivocal sizes with significantly more female patients on female (n = 55) vs male (n = 34) resident panels (p < 0.001).

Statistical analyses were conducted in June 2020 to January 2023.Exposure Training and assessment environments in EM residency programs across comparison groups defined by ethnoracial identity (Asian, White, or groups underrepresented in medicine [URM], ie, African American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic/Latine, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander) and sex (female/male).Main Outcomes and Measures Mean Milestone scores (scale, 0-9) across 6 core competency domains: interpersonal and communications skills, medical knowledge, patient care, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and system-based practice. Overall assessment scores were calculated as the mean of the 6 competency scores.Results The study sample comprised 128 ACGME-accredited programs and 16 634 assessments for 2708 EM residents of which 1913 (70.6%) were in 3-year and 795 (29.4%) in 4-year programs.

Immersive virtual environments (VRs) have the growing potential to reduce cognitive load and improve spatial reasoning. However, traditional methods struggle to assess the mental effort required for visuospatial processes due to the difficulty in verbalizing actions and other limitations in self-reported evaluations. In this neuroergonomics study, we aimed to capture the neural activity associated with cognitive workload during visuospatial tasks and evaluate the impact of the visualization medium on visuospatial task performance. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable neuroimaging to assess cognitive effort during spatial-reasoning-based problem-solving and compared a VR, a computer screen, and a physical real-world task presentation. Our results reveal a higher neural efficiency in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during 3D geometry puzzles in VR settings compared to the settings in the physical world and on the computer screen. VR appears to reduce the visuospatial task load by facilitating spatial visualization and providing visual cues. This makes it a valuable tool for spatial cognition training, especially for beginners.

Further, existing studies have focused on how demographics affect either the salary or the kind of job the graduate enters into, but rarely both. In this paper, we explore both and examine if entry into an IT job mediates the effects of demographics on the starting salaries of fresh IT graduates. Our model is tested using data from annual surveys of undergraduate students majoring in IT at a large public university in Singapore over a 5-year period. We find that gender and foreigner status influence both starting salary and fresh graduates' entry into an IT vs. non IT job. Further, the effect of gender on the starting salaries of IT graduates is partially mediated by their entry into an IT job. In other words, part of the reason for a gender difference in starting salary could be attributed to female IT majors being less likely to enter IT jobs upon graduation than their male counterparts. On the other hand, foreign IT graduates are more likely to enter IT jobs, yet their starting salaries are found to be lower than local graduates.

Loss of coolant accident (LOCA), steam generator tube rupture (SGTR), steam line break (SLB), and loss of voltage (LOV) were the nuclear power plant accident situations used as task scenarios for the experiment. For all accident scenarios, the SART score did not show a significant difference between men and women. Shannon entropy, dwell time entropy, and heat map entropy did not show a significant difference between men and women, but Markov entropy was found to be significantly higher in women. In conclusion, there was no significant difference between men and women in awareness of accident situations.

Gender Differences in Clinical Performance Assessment of Internal Medicine Residents: A Longitudinal Analysis of the Influence of Faculty and Trainee Gender,"Gender Equity Med Workgroup; Klein, R; Julian, KA; Koch, J; Snyder, ED; Jassal, S; Simon, W; Millard, A; Uthlaut, B; Burnett-Bowie, SAM; Ufere, NN; Alba-Nguyen, S; Volerman, A; Thompson, V; Kumar, A; White, BA; Park, YS; Palamara, K","PurposeCompetency-based medical education relies on equitable assessment. This study examined the influence of faculty and trainee gender on assessments of internal medicine (IM) resident performance over time. MethodA longitudinal analysis of clinical performance assessments from 7 U.S. IM residency programs (July 2014-June 2019) was conducted. Core competency scores (patient care [PC], medical knowledge [MK], practice-based learning and improvement [PBLI], systems-based practice [SBP], professionalism [PROF], and interpersonal and communication skills [ICS]) were standardized across programs. Cross-classified mixed-effects linear regression evaluated the relationship between gender and standardized competency scores within training programs, while adjusting for multiple variables including IM In Training Examination percentile rank. ResultsData included 9,346 evaluations by 1,011 faculty (552 [55%] men, 459 [45%] women) for 664 residents (358 [54%] men, 306 [46%] women). Initially, women residents' scores were significantly lower than men's in PC (estimated difference [standard error], -0.097 [0.033]; P = .004), MK (-0.145 [0.034], P < .001), and PBLI (-0.090 [0.040], P = .022). PC, MK, PBLI, and SBP scores increased more over time for women residents than men (PC: 0.050 [0.015], P = .001; MK: 0.052 [0.015], P = .001; PBLI: 0.036 [0.018], P = .048; SBP: 0.036 [0.016], P = .027). PROF and ICS scores were comparable across gender. There was a significant interaction between faculty gender and postgraduate year (PGY) across all competencies but none between resident gender, faculty gender, and PGY, indicating that men and women faculty rated residents differently over time but were consistent in how they rated men and women residents. ConclusionsGender-based assessment differences were variable across competencies and time. Women residents had lower scores initially but greater gains in ""hard skill"" (MK, PC, and PBLI) than in ""soft skill"" (ICS and PROF) competencies, suggesting assessment inequities.

Impact of prior experience and gender on cognitive load during initial drone use,"Garofalo, SG; Farenga, SJ; Subramaniam, G","The purpose of this demonstration study was to determine the effect of prior experiences and gender on cognitive demands at the initial educational technology experience. The task of drone operation was selected as a novel educational technological tool and videogame use was determined to be a tangential prior experience. Through the framework of embodied cognition, the NASA Task Load Index was used to measure cognitive demand. Practicing middle- and high-school science teachers were recruited to participate in this study. Participants operated drones at three instances over two weeks. An additional challenging task was also presented. A mixed ANOVA suggested a significant interaction between videogame use and time: F(2, 28) = 3.77, p< 0.05. A significant interaction between gender and time was also observed: F(2, 29) = 3.72, p< 0.05. For both prior experience and gender, the differences were observed at the first instance of drone operation and not at subsequent trials. Results suggest prior experience and gender may only affect cognitive load at the initial experience and leveling of cognitive load occurs with continued practice. These findings can support an educator's planning for drone-based activities and help to mitigate the stigma of gender differences regarding technology use. Additionally, these findings support the need to examine and enhance related and transferable skills, such as hand-eye coordination and spatial thinking, to lessen cognitive load at the initial educational experience.",2024,,DISCOVER PSYCHOLOGY,4,1,,WOS:001349576100001,10.1007/s44202-024-00274-8,,#979,Garofalo 2024,"",""
Factors that affect scientific publication in Africa-A gender perspective,"Beaudry, C; Prozesky, H; St-Pierre, C; Mirnezami, SR","A large body of literature on gender differences in scientific publication output has clearly established that women scientists publish less that men do. Yet, no single explanation or group of explanations satisfactorily accounts for this difference, which has been called the ""productivity puzzle"". To provide a more refined portrait of the scientific publication output of women in relation to that of their male peers, we conducted a web-based survey in 2016 of individual researchers across all African countries, except Libya. The resulting 6,875 valid questionnaires submitted by respondents in the STEM, Health Science and SSH fields were analyzed using multivariate regressions on the self-reported number of articles published in the preceding 3 years. Controlling for a variety of variables including career stage, workload, mobility, research field, and collaboration, we measured the direct and moderating effect of gender on scientific production of African researchers. Our results show that, while women's scientific publication output is positively affected by collaboration and age (impediments to women's scientific output decrease later in their careers), it is negatively impacted by care-work and household chores, limited mobility, and teaching hours. Women are as prolific when they devote the same hours to other academic tasks and raise the same amount of research funding as their male colleagues. Our results lead us to argue that the standard academic career model, relying on continuous publications and regular promotions, assumes a masculine life cycle that reinforces the general perception that women with discontinuous careers are less productive than their male colleagues, and systematically disadvantages women. We conclude that the solution resides beyond women's empowerment, i.e., in the broader institutions of education and the family, which have an important role to play in fostering men's equal contribution to household chores and care-work.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN RESEARCH METRICS AND ANALYTICS,8,,,WOS:001379261500001,10.3389/frma.2023.1040823,,#980,Beaudry 2023,"",""

Our findings suggested that when undergraduates evaluated their professors on specific criteria concerning teaching performance, they expressed their opinion regardless of the professors' gender. However, when being asked for a single overall evaluation, as whether they would recommend the professor as one of their best professors, the students tended to favor male professors over their female peers by a slight margin.

Correlation of online assessment parameters with summative exam performance in undergraduate medical education of pharmacology: a prospective cohort study,"KÃ¼hbeck, F; Berberat, PO; Engelhardt, S; Sarikas, A","Background Learning analytics aims to improve learning outcomes through the systematic measurement and analysis of learning-related data. However, which parameters have the highest predictive power for academic performance remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of different online assessment parameters with summative exam performance in undergraduate medical education of pharmacology. Methods A prospective study was conducted with a cohort of undergraduate medical students enrolled in a pharmacology course at Technical University of Munich, Germany. After a four-week teaching and learning period, students were given access to an online assessment platform consisting of 440 multiple choice (MC) questions. After 12 days, a final written summative exam was performed. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed for different online assessment parameters as predictors and summative exam performance as dependent variable. Self-perceived pharmacology competence was measured by questionnaires pre- and postintervention. Results A total of 224 out of 393 (57%) students participated in the study and were included in the analysis. There was no significant correlation for the parameters ""number of logins"" (r = 0.01, p = 0.893), ""number of MC-questions answered"" (r = 0.02, p = 0.813) and ""time spent on the assessment platform"" (r = - 0.05, p = 0.459) with exam performance. The variable ""time per question"" was statistically significant (p = 0.006), but correlated negatively (r = - 0.18) with academic performance of study participants. Only ""total score"" (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and the ""score of first attempt"" (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with final grades. In a multiple regression analysis, ""score first attempt"" accounted for 52% of the variation of ""score final exam"", and ""time per question"" and ""total score"" for additional 5 and 1.4%, respectively. No gender-specific differences were observed. Finally, online assessments resulted in improved self-perceived pharmacology competence of students.

Gender Disparity in Evaluation of Internal Medicine Clerkship Performance,"Gorth, DJ; Magee, RG; Rosenberg, SE; Mingioni, N","IMPORTANCE Women studying medicine currently equal men in number, but evidence suggests that men and women might not be evaluated equally throughout their education.OBJECTIVE To examine whether there are differences associated with gender in either objective or subjective evaluations of medical students in an internal medicine clerkship.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated data from 277 third-year medical students completing internal medicine clerkships in the 2017 to 2018 academic year at an academic hospital and its affiliates in Pennsylvania. Data were analyzed from September to November 2020.EXPOSURE Gender, presumed based on pronouns used in evaluations.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Likert scale evaluations of clinical skills, standardized examination scores, and written evaluations were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to observe trends in measures. Word embeddings were analyzed for narrative evaluations.RESULTS Analyses of 277 third-year medical students completing an internal medicine clerkship (140 women [51%] with a mean [SD] age of 25.5 [2.3] years and 137 [49%] presumed men with a mean [SD] age of 25.9 [2.7] years) detected no difference in final grade distribution. However, women outperformed men in 5 of 8 domains of clinical performance, including patient interaction (difference, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.04-0.13]), growth mindset (difference, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.01-0.11]), communication (difference, 0.05 [95% CI, 0-0.12]), compassion (difference, 0.125 [95% CI, 0.03-0.11]), and professionalism (difference, 0.07 [95% CI, 0-0.11]). With no difference in examination scores or subjective knowledge evaluation, there was a positive correlation between these variables for both genders (women: r = 0.35; men: r = 0.26) but different elevations for the line of best fit (P < .001). Multivariate regression analyses revealed associations between final grade and patient interaction (women: coefficient, 6.64 [95% CI, 2.16-11.12]; P = .004; men: coefficient, 7.11 [95% CI, 2.94-11.28]; P < .001), subjective knowledge evaluation (women: coefficient, 6.66 [95% CI, 3.87-9.45]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 5.45 [95% CI, 2.43-8.43]; P < .001), reported time spent with the student (women: coefficient, 5.35 [95% CI, 2.62-8.08]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 3.65 [95% CI, 0.83-6.47]; P = .01), and communication (women: coefficient, 6.32 [95% CI, 3.12-9.51]; P < .001; men: coefficient, 4.21 [95% CI, 0.92-7.49]; P = .01). The model based on the men's data also included growth mindset as a significant variable (coefficient, 4.09 [95% CI, 0.67-7.50]; P = .02). For narrative evaluations, words in context with ""he or him"" and ""she or her"" differed, with agentic terms used in descriptions of men and personality descriptors used more often for women.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite no difference in final grade, women scored higher than men on various domains of clinical performance, and performance in these domains was associated with evaluators' suggested final grade.

Content analysis was used to assess two key characteristics of comments- valence (overall positive or negative orientation) and specificity (detailed nature and actionability of comment) - via a blinded, multi-analyst approach. Differences in comment valence and specificity with gender and race and ethnicity were assessed using multilevel regression, controlling for multiple covariates including quantitative competency ratings.ResultsData included 3,383 evaluations with narrative comments by 597 faculty of 698 residents, including 45% of comments about women residents and 13.2% about residents who identified with race and ethnicities underrepresented in medicine. Most comments were moderately specific and positive. Comments about women residents were more positive (estimate 0.06, p 0.045) but less specific (estimate - 0.07, p 0.002) compared to men.

Ethnic/Racial Bias in Medical School Performance Evaluation of General Surgery Residency Applicants,"Polanco-Santana, JC; Storino, A; Souza-Mota, L; Gangadharan, SP; Kent, TS","OBJECTIVE: Differential use of communal terms (caring/ unselfish traits) versus agentic terms (goal-oriented/leadership/achievement traits) may reveal bias and has been extensively reported in letters of recommendation for residency. We evaluated bias in medical student performance evaluations (MSPE) of general surgery residency applicants.DESIGN: This is a retrospective study evaluating ethnic/race bias, as measured by differential use of agentic and communal terms, in MSPEs of residency applicants. 50% of MSPEs were randomly selected. An ethnic bias calculator derived from an open-source online gender bias calculator was populated with a list of validated agentic and communal terms. Relative frequency of communal and agentic terms was used to estimate bias. Multivariable regression was used to assess the association between the terms and ethnicity/race.PARTICIPANTS: US medical students applying for a categorical surgery residency position at a single academic institution for a single Match cycle.RESULTS: A total of 339 MSPEs were reviewed from 119 US medical schools. Genders were equally represented (women, 51.6%); most participants were white and Asian applicants (79.1%). Overall, MSPEs were more agency biased (65.2%) than communal biased (16.2%) or neutral (18.6%). MSPEs for Black and Hispanic/Latinx applicants were more likely to contain communal rather than agentic terms (adjusted OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.52-6.02) when compared to white and Asian applicants. This finding was independent of MSPE writer's gender or rank.CONCLUSIONS: Surgery residency applicants self-identifying as Black and Hispanic/Latinx were more likely to be described using communal traits compared to white and Asian applicants, suggesting ethnic/racial bias.

Specifically, we set out to: (1) describe the multiple intersectional identities (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, rank, caregiver status, disability status) represented by the faculty, (2) examine potential disparities in well-being, workload, and productivity linked to these intersectional factors, and (3) identify qualitative themes endorsed by faculty as they relate to lived experiences during COVID-19.Methods: This was a cross-sectional mixed-methods research study. The Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota developed and implemented a survey between February-June of 2021 in response to national reports of disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections.Results: There were 291 full-time faculty who participated in the study. Quantitative findings indicated that faculty with multiple intersectional identities (e.g., woman+assistant professor+caregiver+underrepresented in medicine) reported greater depression symptoms, work/family conflict, and stress in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Furthermore, faculty with more intersectional identities reported higher clinical workloads and service responsibilities and lower productivity with regard to research article submissions, publications, and grant submissions in contrast to faculty with fewer intersectional identities. Qualitative findings supported quantitative findings and broadened understanding of potential underlying reasons.Conclusions: Findings confirm anecdotal evidence that faculty with lived experiences from multiple intersections may be disproportionately experiencing negative outcomes from the pandemic. These findings can inform decisions about how to address these disparities moving into the next several years with regard to promotion and tenure, burnout and well-being, and faculty retention in academic medical settings.

The most commonly used WPI terms were work-life balance, work-life integration, and work-home or work-life conflict(s). There was no consistency in the definition of any terms across studies. There was heterogeneity in the way WPI was measured, and only 8 (7.8%) studies used a validated measurement tool. The authors identified 6 key driver domains of WPI: work and personal demands; colleague and institutional support and resources; personal identity, roles, health, and values; work schedule and flexibility; partner and family support; and personal and professional strategies.ConclusionsThe authors found significant variability in the terms, definitions, and measures used to study physician WPI. They offer a conceptual model of the WPI construct that can be used to more consistently study physician WPI in the future. Future work should further investigate the validity of this model and generate consensus around WPI terms, definitions, and measures.",2024,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,99,3,331-339,WOS:001185587400024,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005579,,#994,Webber 2024,"",""
Information and communication technologies-assisted after-hours work: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the relationships with work-family/life management variables,"Santos, A; Roberto, MS; Camilo, C; Chambel, MJ","The phenomenon of information and communication technology (ICT)-assisted after-hours work has led to rising academic interest in examining its impact on workers' lives. ICT-assisted after-hours work may intrude on the home domain and contribute to higher work-family/life conflict, lower work-family/life balance, or higher work-family/life enrichment (the last one owing to the acquisition of competencies transferable to the home domain). Additionally, owing to cultural and societal differences in gender roles, the relationships between ICT-assisted after-hours work and work-family/life management variables may differ between female and male workers. To analyze the current empirical findings, this study performed a literature review with 38 articles and a meta-analysis with 37 articles. Our findings showed that ICT-assisted after-hours work was positively related to work-family/life enrichment (r = 0.335, p < 0.001; 95% CI [0.290, 0.406]), but also to work-family/life conflict (r = 0.335, p < 0.001; 95% CI [0.290, 0.406]).

Gender Performance Gaps Across Different Assessment Methods and the Underlying Mechanisms: The Case of Incoming Preparation and Test Anxiety,"Salehi, S; Cotner, S; Azarin, SM; Carlson, EE; Driessen, M; Ferry, VE; Harcombe, W; McGaugh, S; Wassenberg, D; Yonas, A; Ballen, CJ","A persistent ""gender penalty"" in exam performance disproportionately impacts women in large introductory science courses, where exam grades generally account for the majority of the students' assessment of learning. Previous work in introductory biology demonstrates that some social psychological factors may underlie these gender penalties, including test anxiety and interest in course content. In this paper, we examine the extent that gender predicts performance across disciplines, and investigate social psychological factors that mediate performance. We also examine whether a gender penalty persists beyond introductory courses, and can be observed in more advanced upper division science courses. We ran analyses (1) across two colleges at a single institution: the College of Biological Sciences and the College of Science and Engineering (i.e., physics, chemistry, materials science, math); and (2) across introductory lower division courses and advanced upper division courses, or those that require a prerequisite. We affirm that exams have disparate impacts based on student gender at the introductory level, with female students underperforming relative to male students. We did not observe these exam gender penalties in upper division courses, suggesting that women are either being ""weeded out"" at the introductory level, or ""warming to"" timed examinations. Additionally, results from mediation analyses show that across disciplines and divisions, for women only, test anxiety negatively influences exam performance.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,4,,,WOS:000682681000001,10.3389/feduc.2019.00107,,#996,Salehi 2019,"",""
Impact of Navigation Aid and Spatial Ability Skills on Wayfinding Performance and Workload in Indoor-Outdoor Campus Navigation: Challenges and Design,"Tahir, R; Krogstie, J","Wayfinding is important for everyone on a university campus to understand where they are and get to where they want to go to attend a meeting or a class. This study explores the dynamics of mobile navigation apps and the spatial ability skills of individuals on a wayfinding performance and perceived workload on a university campus wayfinding, including indoor-outdoor navigation, by focusing on three research objectives. (1) Compare the effectiveness of Google Maps (outdoor navigation app) and MazeMap (indoor-outdoor navigation app) on wayfinding performance and perceived workload in university campus wayfinding. (2) Investigate the impact of participants' spatial ability skills on their wayfinding performance and perceived workload regardless of the used navigation app. (3) Highlight the challenges in indoor-outdoor university campus wayfinding using mobile navigation apps. To achieve this, a controlled experiment was conducted with 22 participants divided into a control (using Google Maps) and an experiment group (using MazeMap). Participants were required to complete a time-bound wayfinding task of navigating to meeting rooms in different buildings within the Gloshaugen campus of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway. Participants were assessed on spatial ability tests, mental workload, and wayfinding performance using a questionnaire, observation notes and a short follow-up interview about the challenges they faced in the task. The findings reveal a negative correlation between overall spatial ability score (spatial reasoning, spatial orientation, and sense of direction) and perceived workload (NASA TLX score and Subjective Workload Rating) and a negative correlation between sense of direction score and total hesitation during wayfinding task. However, no significant difference was found between the Google Maps and the MazeMap group for wayfinding performance and perceived workload.

"Relationships between core self-evaluation, leader empowering behavior, and job security among Jordan University Hospital nurses","Sulaiman, AM; Alfuqaha, OA; Shaath, TA; Alkurdi, RI; Almomani, RB","Nurses are facing real stressors due to patients' needs and leaders' demands. The aim of this study is to explore the perceived level of core self-evaluation (CSE), leader empowering behavior (LEB), and job security among Jordan University Hospital nurses in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between the selected variables. Differences of gender, educational level, experience, and site of work are also examined with job security. Moreover, it evaluates the contribution of CSE, LEB, gender, educational level, experience, and site of work in predicting job security among Jordan University Hospital nurses. A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted for this study. A convenience sample of 214 nurses from Jordan University Hospital was completed the CSE scale, LEB scale, and job security scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and stepwise regression were used to analyze the results. The results indicate that job security is found to be at high level, whereas LEB and CSE are found to be at moderate levels among nurses. Significant positive relationships are found between CSE, LEB, and job security. Male nurses and medical/surgical floors reported higher levels of job security than female nurses and intensive care units. Finally, the results show that LEB and gender are significant predictors of job security among nurses.

Out-of-hours workload among Norwegian general practitioners - an observational study,"Rebnord, IK; Morken, T; Maartmann-Moe, K; Hunskaar, S","Background Repeated studies of working hours among Norwegian regular general practitioners (RGPs) have shown that the average total number of weekly working hours has remained unchanged since 1994 and up until 2014. For both male and female RGPs, the mean total weekly working hours amounted to almost 50 h in 2014. In recent years, Norwegian RGPs have become increasingly dissatisfied. They experience significantly increased workload without compensation in the form of more doctors or better payment. A study from the Norwegian Directorate of Health in 2018 (the RGP study) showed that Norwegian RGPs worked 55.6 h weekly (median 52.5). 25% of the respondents worked more than 62.2 h weekly. Based on data from the RGP study we investigated Norwegian RGP's out-of-hours (OOH) work, how the working time was distributed, and to what extent the OOH work affected the regular working hours. Methods In early 2018, an electronic survey was sent to all 4640 RGPs in Norway. Each RGP reported how many minutes that were spent that particular day on various tasks during seven consecutive days. Working time also included additional tasks in the municipality, other professional medical work and OOH primary health care. Differences were analysed by independent t-tests, and regression analyses. Results One thousand eighty hundred seventy-six RGPs (40.4%) responded, 640 (34.1%) had registered OOH work. Male RGPs worked on average 1.5 h more doing regular work than did females (p = 0.001) and on average 2.3 h more OOH work than females (p = 0.079). RGPs with no OOH work registered a mean of 1.0 h more clinical work than RGPs working OOH (p = 0.043). There was a large variation in OOH working hours. A linear regression analysis showed that male RGPs and RGPs in rural areas had the heaviest OOH workload. Conclusions One in three Norwegian RGPs undertook OOH work during the registration week in the RGP study. OOH work was done in addition to a sizeable regular workload as an RGP. We found small gender differences.

Participants were randomly driven to one of three activities: one with Anglo male characters, one containing a female character, and one with a Hispanic male character (i.e., Carl, Cathy, and Carlos, all with equivalent credentials). Among findings, the woman (Cathy) was recommended significantly more to leadership than the men (Carl and Carlos). Interestingly, physics faculty members recommended Carlos twice as often as they recommended Carl and three times more often than they recommended Cathy to sponsor a student group. Recommenders also indicated they considered gender significantly more than race/ethnicity when weighing decisions. Analysis of rationales indicated gender-based implicit biases wherein respondents perceived Cathy more often than Carl or Carlos to possess stereotypical female attributes of being well liked and collaborative.

Spirometric Evaluation among Individuals Working in Stone Chip Crushing Factories: A Cross-sectional Study,"Mukherjee, S; Sinha, P; Sengupta, D","Introduction: Silicosis is still one of the most serious occupational health diseases in the world because of its potential to cause physical impairment. It is a progressive and debilitating occupational lung disease that primarily affects workers in the manufacturing, construction and mining industries. Silicosis is mostly caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust. Still, a substantial study on the lung health of stone quarry workers in Western Bengal are still lacking. Aim: To determine the alterations in pulmonary function status (by spirometry) and evaluate the gender differences in pulmonary mechanics among workers affected by occupational silica dust. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a duration of three months to analyse the spirometric changes in lung function among 62 workers exposed to occupational silica dust, aged 18 to 60 years (both genders), attending the Department of Physiology at Rampurhat Government Medical College, West Bengal, India. After obtaining anthropometric measurements, including height and weight of the subjects, spirometry was carried out on each patient according to the recommendations of American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Patients were grouped into categories of normal, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), restrictive pattern, mixed ventilatory defect, and Small Airflow Obstruction (SAO) based on spirometric values of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/ FVC, Forced mid-Expiratory Flow (FEF25%-75%), and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) values. Analysis was performed using GraphPad QuickCalcs software using Chi-square test and Unpaired t-test. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 49.6 years, with 51 (82.26%) males and 11 (17.74%) females among the 62 study subjects. There were 36 (58.06%) smokers and 26 (41.94%) non smokers. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) of the study subjects was 17.268 +/- 2.501 kg/m(2) (underweight category). A significant reduction in spirometric variables was observed below the lower normal limit of percent predicted, including FVC (80-120%), FEV1 (80-120%), PEFR (>60% predicted value for men; up to 100 L/min lower than predicted for males, and 85 L/min for females), FEF (25%-75%) (50%-60% and up to 130% of the average), and Forced Expiratory Time (FET) (6 secs), except for the FEV1/FVC ratio (70-85%), which was higher than the normal limit. The majority of the study subjects belonged to the mixed ventilatory defect category, comprising 36 subjects (58.06%), 17 (27.42%) had a Restrictive Spirometric Pattern (RSP), while the remaining 9 subjects (14.52%) were classified as normal. Conclusion: Detectable spirometric changes have been observed among stone quarry workers, revealing not only restrictive patterns but also mixed ventilatory defects.

Validation of the Raw National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) Questionnaire to Assess Perceived Workload in Patient Monitoring Tasks: Pooled Analysis Study Using Mixed Models,"Said, S; Gozdzik, M; Roche, TR; Braun, J; RÃ¶ssler, J; Kaserer, A; Spahn, DR; NÃ¶thiger, CB; Tscholl, DW","Background: Patient monitoring is indispensable in any operating room to follow the patient's current health state based on measured physiological parameters. Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector.Objective: This study aimed to validate a modified version of the raw NASA-TLX in patient monitoring tasks by investigating its correspondence with expected lower and higher workload situations and its robustness against nonworkload-related covariates. This defines criterion validity.Methods: In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness-oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates.Results: We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001).Conclusions: This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. We reported high criterion validity. The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload.

Study related factors associated with study engagement and student burnout among German university students,"Olson, N; Oberhoffer-Fritz, R; Reiner, B; Schulz, T","IntroductionStudent burnout has become a health concern in higher education systems. Its prevalence rates are high due to specific demands in this life situation. It leads not only to increased academic dropout rates but is also associated with negative health outcomes both physically and mentally. Its counterpart is study engagement, which is a positive, fulfilling, study-related attitude characterized by energy, dedication, and absorption. There has not been a systematical approach covering the demands directly posed by the academic environment itself. Additionally, academic subject fields apart from medicine and nursing sciences have been mostly neglected in regards to this research field. The aim of the study is therefore to identify contributing factors for both burnout and engagement within the academic environment in a sample of different subject fields at a German university. MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3,451 students of all academic subjects at a technical university in Germany has been analyzed using an online survey. Sociodemographic data, study engagement, student burnout, study satisfaction, academic workload, number of semesters and occupational liabilities have been analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the associations of burnout symptoms and study engagement. ResultsAlmost a third of the students showed frequent burnout symptoms, while 42.5% showed a high degree of study engagement with no differences in gender. Age was identified as a risk factor for frequent signs of cynicism (OR = 1.073). Study satisfaction (OR between 0.459 and 0.702), semester progression (OR = 0.959) and working moderately (OR between 0.605 and 0.637) was associated with fewer symptoms in different burnout-dimensions. Study satisfaction is positively associated with study engagement (OR = 2.676). Academic workload is positively related to both burnout (OR between 1.014 and 1.021) and study engagement (OR = 1.014). DiscussionA substantial number of students show frequent symptoms of burnout and the majority is not highly engaged. The included factors contribute to the model to various degrees and show that university-bound factors play a major role. Fostering a supportive environment is key for study engagement, health and well-being.

Effects of Department Type and Disability Status on Medical School Faculty Wellbeing,"Abulela, MAA; Schowengerdt, B; Dorr, H; Termuhlen, A; Krohn, K; Violato, C","PurposeFaculty wellbeing impacts student learning and is a priority among medical schools, especially as a counterbalance to growing burnout. Previous researchers found differences in burnout by sex and race among clinicians, but not for faculty with disabilities. Accordingly, the purpose was to test the association between faculty's wellbeing, burnout, and control over workload and investigate differences in wellbeing attributed to department type and ability status.MethodThe authors developed and administered a comprehensive wellbeing survey to University of Minnesota Medical School faculty, of whom 703 provided complete responses. The authors conducted two-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc analysis to test for differences in faculty wellbeing domains due to department type (basic sciences, nonsurgical, surgical, and two large departments of Medicine and Pediatrics) and disability status (yes, no). The authors also fitted a two-way ordinal model since burnout frequency and control over workload were assessed by one ordinal item each.ResultsWellbeing domains were positively correlated with control over workload but negatively associated with burnout. Faculty with disabilities reported less support from their work environment and meeting of their basic needs. Department type had a statistically significant impact on faculty's sense of basic needs, respect, and contribution. Multiple comparisons revealed faculty in basic sciences departments had higher scores within basic needs compared to the departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, and surgical departments, who reported lower levels of respect as well. Results revealed department type and disability status affected the frequency of burnout, as faculty in basic sciences departments reported lower levels of burnout compared to other departments.ConclusionsResults support disaggregating wellbeing by department and ability status for targeted interventions due to differences- notably among faculty with disabilities and surgical departments- in their assessment of basic needs, work environment, respect, and contribution. Results suggest revisiting interventions in these domains to account for lower reported wellbeing.",2025,,HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS,8,1,,WOS:001393001600001,10.1002/hsr2.70317,,#1010,Abulela 2025,"",""

Method The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of clinical performance assessment scores at 6 U.S. IM residency programs from 2016 to 2017. Residents underrepresented in medicine (URiM) were identified using self-reported race/ethnicity. Standardized scores were calculated for Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. Cross-classified mixed-effects regression assessed the association between race/ethnicity and competency scores, adjusting for rotation time of year and setting; resident gender, postgraduate year, and IM In-Training Examination percentile rank; and faculty gender, rank, and specialty. Results Data included 3,600 evaluations by 605 faculty of 703 residents, including 94 (13.4%) URiM residents.

Evidence from previous reviews suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause depression. In this article, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating (if feasible) the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from depression that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.Objectives: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on depression (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality).Data sources: We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trial Registers Platform, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsycInfo. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts.Study eligibility and criteria: We included working-age (>15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged <15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on depression (prevalence, incidence and/or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined odds ratios using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project.Results: Twenty-two studies (all cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 109,906 participants (51,324 females) in 32 countries (as one study included multiple countries) in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with a clinical diagnostic interview (four studies), interview questions about diagnosis and treatment of depression (three studies) or a validated self-administered rating scale (15 studies). The outcome was defined as incident depression in all 22 studies, with first time incident depression in 21 studies and recurrence of depression in one study. We did not identify any study on prevalence of depression or on mortality from depression. For the body of evidence for the outcome incident depression, we had serious concerns for risk of bias due to selection because of incomplete outcome data (most studies assessed depression only twice, at baseline and at a later follow-up measurement, and likely have missed cases of depression that occurred after baseline but were in remission at the time of the follow-up measurement) and due to missing information on life-time prevalence of depression before baseline measurement.Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) depression of working 41-48 h/week (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.29, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence); 49-54 h/week (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 40%, low quality of evidence); and > 55 h/week (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, 17 studies, 91,142 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences by WHO region, sex, age group and socioeconomic status. Sensitivity analyses found no statistically significant differences by outcome measurement (clinical diagnostic interview [gold standard] versus other measures) and risk of bias (""high""/ ""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains).Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence from human data as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for all three exposure categories, 41-48, 48-54 and >55 h/week, for depression prevalence, incidence and mortality; the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure.

Evidence from mechanistic data and prior studies suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause stroke. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. Objectives: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence, and mortality).

We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines, and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. Study eligibility and criteria: We included working-age (>= 15 years) individuals in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (prevalence, incidence or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first review stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using the Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. Results: Twenty-two studies (20 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 839,680 participants (364,616 females) in eight countries from three WHO regions (Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (13 studies), self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies), direct diagnosis by a physician (1 study) or during a medical interview (1 study). The outcome was defined as an incident non-fatal stroke event in nine studies (7 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies), incident fatal stroke event in one cohort study and incident non-fatal or fatal (""mixed"") event in 12 studies (all cohort studies).Cohort studies were judged to have a relatively low risk of bias; therefore, we prioritized evidence from these studies, but synthesised evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. stroke incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). Eligible studies were found on the effects of long working hours on stroke incidence and mortality, but not prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were uncertain about the effect on incidence of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.14, 18 studies, 277,202 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence). There may have been an increased risk for acquiring stroke when working 49-54 h/week compared with 35-40 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28, 17 studies, 275,181participants, I-2 0%, p 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working >= 55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring stroke, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61, 7 studies, 162,644 participants, I-2 3%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12, 12 studies, 265,937 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence), 49-54 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, 11 studies, 256,129 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 55 h/week (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.31, 10 studies, 664,647 participants, I-2 20%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region, age, sex, socioeconomic status and type of stroke. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus ""mixed"") except for the comparison working >= 55 h/week versus 35-40 h/week for stroke incidence (p for subgroup differences: 0.05), risk of bias (""high""/""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains), effect estimate measures (risk versus hazard versus odds ratios) and comparator (exact versus approximate definition). Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for all exposure categories for stroke prevalence and mortality and for exposure to 41-48 h/week for stroke incidence. Evidence on exposure to 48-54 h/week and >= 55 h/week was judged as ""limited evidence for harmfulness"" and ""sufficient evidence for harmfulness"" for stroke incidence, respectively.

Analyses were conducted between June 2020 and January 2023. Exposure: Gendered racial bias as proxied by intersections of underrepresented in medicine (URM) status and gender identity. Main Outcomes: Mean Milestones scores across 6 core competency domains including Interpersonal and Communications Skills, Medical Knowledge, Patient Care, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Professionalism, and System-Based Practice. Overall assessment scores were calculated as the mean of the 6 competency scores. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 16,634 assessments for 2,708 residents in 128 programs. The ethnoracial identity for most residents was White (68.6%), followed by Asian (17.2%) and URM (14.3%), with majority males (65.4%). We found that, compared to White men, URM women in three-year programs were rated increasingly lower in Medical Knowledge (-0.47, 95% CI: -0.77, -0.17), Patient Care (URM women: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01), and Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (-0.37, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.09) by the postgraduate year (PGY) 3 year-end assessment. URM women were also rated lower in all 6 competencies in four-year programs over the assessment period. Similar but more attenuated differences were detected for URM men, Asian women, and Asian men but at later assessment periods and in specific program lengths. We also observed similar trends for the overall assessment score. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): URM women residents were consistently rated lower than White men during residency, which may reflect gendered racial discrimination in physician competency assessments.

"The influence of work group size and space sharing on the perceived productivity, overall comfort and health of occupants in commercial and academic buildings",Khoshbakht M.; ; Baird G.; Rasheed E.O.,"The influence of work groups (the number of occupants sharing an office) on occupant satisfaction with workplace environments was compared between commercial buildings and academic buildings. Using the Building Use Studies (BUS) methodology, a sample of 5000 surveys was collected over a 12-year period from 67 buildings around the world. In both academic and commercial buildings, solo offices (single occupant) obtained the best scores regarding productivity, overall comfort and health. Academics most disliked middle-sized open-plan offices (shared by 6 to 9 occupants), while in commercial buildings, office occupants most disliked large open-plan offices (shared by over 9 occupants). Occupants had higher productivity and perceived health in commercial buildings than those in academic buildings in all work groups. Productivity decreased as the number of occupants in the office increased in both academic and commercial buildings for all work groups except for middle-sized open-plan offices.

Attitudes and thoughts of medical practitioners towards their profession in the era of financial crisis in Greece,Nena E.; ; Fasoulakis Z.; Trypsianis G.; Constantinidis T.C.; Kontomanolis E.,"Introduction. The financial crisis which started in Greece about 10 years ago has affected the income of citizens, their quality of life, as well as social and occupational relationships. Aim of the present study was to assess the attitudes towards working conditions and personal life and to explore quality of life, as well as disorders in physical condition, sleep, mood and their predictors, among doctors working or being trained in a tertiary hospital of NE Greece. Methods. Included were 133 medical students and doctors of all ranks (61.7% males) practicing medicine in a university tertiary hospital in Greece. All of them answered a 31-item questionnaire regarding their working conditions, and personal life, daytime activities and sleeping habits. Results. In general, the majority reported dissatisfaction with the work environment, the salary and they rated their quality of life worse than that of the general population. Weekly workload exceeded 60 hours for the majority. No difference between sexes was revealed, with the exception of use of energy drinks which was more prevalent in males (70.7% vs. 51%, p = 0.022). Comparison between ranks revealed that medical students performed better in everyday activities and socialization, although prevalence of reported fatigue was higher in them. Finally, it was demonstrated that surgeons used more frequently medication to achieve sleep promotion (80.4% vs. 36%, p < 0.001) and daily energy (78.4% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). Conclusions.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of multiple years of Society of Reproductive Biologists and Technologists (SRBT) Salary and Job Satisfaction Surveys with comparable publications and benchmarks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SRBT biennial survey data 2001-2018 were analyzed to determine longitudinal trends of salary among reproductive lab personnel. Variables including work environment, benefits, salary of various job titles, clinic setting, gender, job satisfaction and burnout, as well as off-site consulting, were analyzed. Key compensation numbers were compared with national earnings data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and similar clinical lab and biotechnology sector wage surveys. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Total of 1,737 responses were analyzed. Overall, survey responses showed satisfaction with their current jobs and optimism on job market projections. However, the majority of survey responses also indicated significant stress (89% answered medium to extremely high level of stress), burnout (60.6%) and overtime work (72.8%). Most common benefits received were health and dental insurance, paid time-off, retirement plan, and support for conference attendance and certification. In 2018, the average annual clinical workload processed by each hands-on personnel included 108 fresh oocyte retrievals, 88 FETs, 79 biopsies for PGT, and 167 andrology tasks. Throughout the past two decades, nominal compensation (non-inflation adjusted) of reproductive lab professionals steadily increased throughout most of the survey period, with numbers higher than the national average for college/advanced degree workers. Such earnings were higher than most clinical lab specialties as well, with exception in a couple biotechnology sectors. Director earnings increases trended higher to advanced degree workers nationwide. Non-director categories showed a more significant salary growth than nationwide college/advanced degree workers and lab directors. Data from recent years revealed a wider distribution in salary range, which may reflect the volatility due to short supply of senior embryologists. Recent data also demonstrated an increasing portion of bonus in the compensation structure, which may indicate a broader utilization of bonus/incentives across all clinical settings, and possibly a contributing factor to the wider range of compensation among lab personnel. Gender-related difference in compensation remains significant despite an overall smaller gap than nationwide college/ advanced degree workers. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The salary trend of reproductive lab profession show a steady increase throughout the period, a good indication compared to national labor wage and related clinical lab wage benchmarks.

ME were more comfortable than LE (P<.0001), and did more rectovaginal examinations (P=.0002). Overall rectovaginal exam performance was low (3% LE compared with 12.8% ME). Regardless of experience, most PCPs thought pelvic exams should be performed every 3 years (60% LE compared with 54.6% ME, P5NS). <ovid:br/>DISCUSSION(S): Guidelines surrounding pelvic examination are in flux. Most PCPs currently perform pelvic examinations. FM appear more comfortable than IM. LE physicians were less comfortable and did fewer bimanual and rectovaginal exams than ME. Most PCPs felt exams could be performed less than annually. Since more medical graduates enter primary care residencies than obstetrics and gynecology (45% compared with 5%), there is opportunity to focus pelvic examination teaching on high-yield components.

Functional capacity perception and achieved treadmill workload: Gender differences in cardiac rehabilitation participants,Nathan B.; ; Caitlin S.; Teresa C.; Cynthia O.; Mary M.,"Introduction: Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) services are underutilized despite guidelinerecommendations. Underutilization is more prevalent in women despite knownbenefits. Studies suggest incongruences between achieved maximal treadmill (M-TM)metabolic equivalency (METs) and functional capacity (FC) perception for men andwomen. <ovid:br/>Purpose(s): The study aimed to compare M-TM METs and the Duke Activity Status Index(DASI) of male and female Phase II CR participants. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A retrospective comparative design was used to compare 435 participants of aPhase II CR program who completed = 12 sessions between April 2007 and July 2014at a hospital-based nationally certified CR program located in a western mountainregion. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A retrospective comparative design compared 435 Phase II CR program participants completing = 12 sessions between April 2007 and July 2014. The DASI, a 12-itemself-administered perceived FC assessment questionnaire, was administered two sessionsprior to program discharge. DASI was compared to program end M-TM METs by gender.Medical record review collected gender, age, CR session attendance, M-TM METs, DASIand exercising to American College of Sports Medicine guidelines (Ex2G). T-tests determined statistical significance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 264 males (mean = 64.5 years) and 91 females (mean = 68.9 years) wereincluded and 80 missing data exclusions. Females averaged 5 M-TM METs while malesaveraged 7. Females significantly overestimated mean FC by 25.8% (t = 10.44; p<0.001).Males significantly overestimated by 15.5% (t = 11.88; p<0.001). Males aged 80-92 significantly overestimated FC by 33.3% (t = 5.06; p<0.001) whereas aged 50-59 overestimated by 13% (t = 3.85; p<0.001). Females aged 80-92 significantly overestimated FC by33.3% (t = 5.95; P<0.001) whereas aged 50-59 did not overestimate (t =-1.33; p = 0.170).Ex2G and not Ex2G participants overestimated FC (15.5% vs 25.2%). Amount of FC overestimation was significantly less for those Ex2G (t = 2.15; p = 0.032). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): CR participants Ex2G are better estimators of perceived FC. Females leastaccurately estimate FC. Negative overexertion perceptions and exercise-induced urinaryincontinence may contribute to women being less likely participants in CR exercise.Knowledge of gender differences can help CR staff assist participants to set realistic goalsduring rehabilitation.",2015,/,Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention,35,4,290,624368756,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HCR.0000000000000134,,#1041,Nathan 2015,"",""
Enhanced research assessment performance in graduate vs. undergraduate-entry medical students: Implications for recruitment into academic medicine,Duggan E.M.; ; O'Tuathaigh C.M.P.; Horgan M.; O'Flynn S.,"Background: Studies investigating variance between the academic performance of direct-entry (DEM) versus graduate-entry (GEM) medical students have yielded conflicting results, but their performance in undergraduate research-based assessments has not been compared to-date. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): We aimed to compare the results of DEM and GEM students with respect to their senior research dissertation module. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This retrospective study examined the final year results between 2011-2012 in DEM, (n = 219) and GEM (n = 84) students. Between-group comparisons of dissertation module marks were conducted using independent t-tests. Correlations between marks in dissertation module and in other disciplines assessed during the final year were attained using Pearson's correlation. Multiple regression analysis was employed to adjust for potential confounding factors such as student age and gender. <ovid:br/>Result(s): No apparent difference was apparent between the DEM and GEM students with respect to results achieved across the clinical disciplines examined. However, GEM students performed significantly better than DEMs in their senior research dissertation assessment (Mean = 66.81% vs. 65.00%, fully adjusted p = 0.048). The variable which remained influential in regression analysis was nationality, where North American and Asian students were demonstrated to score lower than their Irish counterparts in the dissertation module (B coefficient = -1.90, SE = 0.94, P = 0.045 and B coefficient = -4.88, SE = 1.00, P < 0.001 respectively). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Performance in the research-based module was significantly better in GEM relative to their DEM colleagues. This finding may have implications for future recruitment into academic medicine, as aptitude and interest in research at undergraduate level has been shown to be associated with increased likelihood of an academic career in medicine. &#xa9; The Author 2014.

Assessment of Gender Bias During Paramedic-Physician Handoffs.,Pettit K; Harris C; Smeltzer K; Sarmiento EJ; Hall JT; Howell C; Liao M; Turner J,"Objective Gender bias against female physicians has been frequently demonstrated and associated with negative feelings toward their careers. Gender bias has also been demonstrated in prehospital clinical care. However, potential gender bias during paramedic-physician handoffs has not been studied. This study aimed to identify gender bias during interactions between prehospital personnel and emergency physicians at the time of patient handoff. Methods An observational study was conducted at an urban academic emergency department. Observers were trained to record information from paramedic-physician handoffs but were blind to the nature of the study. The primary outcome was to whom paramedics initially directed the focus of their handoff report based on physician gender, with secondary outcomes of to whom paramedics directed most of their report and whether they asked about further questions based on physician gender. Results There were 784 observed handoffs. There was no significant association between the gender of the physician and which physician received first attention (Ï(2)Â {1, N = 782} = 0.9736, p = 0.3238) or majority attention (Ï(2)Â {1, N = 780} = 1.9414, p = 0.1635). Paramedics were more likely to ask questions to male attendings than female attendings (Ï2 {1, N = 784} = 4.4319, p = 0.0353). Conclusion We identified limited differences in communication based on gender between paramedics and physicians during emergency department patient handoffs.",2023,Jul,Cureus,15,7,e41709,,10.7759/cureus.41709,37575816,#1046,Pettit 2023,"",""
Gender Difference in Teaching Evaluation Scores of Pediatric Faculty.,Tiedt K; Webber S; Babal J; Nackers KAM; Allen A; Nacht CL; Coller RJ; Eickhoff J; Sklansky DJ; Kieren M; Shadman KA; Kelly MM,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between faculty gender and milestone-based teaching assessment scores assigned by residents. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of milestone-based clinical teaching assessments of pediatric faculty completed by pediatric residents at a mid-sized residency program from July 2016 to June 2019. Assessments included 3 domains (Clinical Interactions, Teaching Skills, Role Modeling/Professionalism) comprised of a total of 11 sub-competency items. We used multilevel logistic regression accounting for repeat measures and clustering to evaluate associations between faculty gender and assessment scores in the 1) top quartile, 2) bottom quartile, or 3) top-box (highest score). Findings were adjusted for faculty rank and academic track, and resident year and gender. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 2889 assessments of 104 faculty were performed by 91 residents. Between assessments of women and men faculty, there were no significant differences in the odds of receiving a score in the top quartile for the 3 domains (Clinical aOR 0.99, P = .86; Teaching aOR 0.99, P = .93; Role Modeling aOR 0.87, P = .089). However, assessments of women were more likely to receive a score in the bottom quartile in both Teaching (aOR 1.23, P = .019) and Role Modeling (aOR 1.26, P = .008). Assessments of women also had lower odds of receiving the highest score in 6 of 11 sub-competencies.

Gender differences in emergency medicine resident assessment: A scoping review.,Menchetti I; Eagles D; Ghanem D; Leppard J; Fournier K; Cheung WJ,"BACKGROUND: Growing literature within postgraduate medical education demonstrates that female resident physicians experience gender bias throughout their training and future careers. This scoping review aims to describe the current body of literature on gender differences in emergency medicine (EM) resident assessment. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review which adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We included research involving resident physicians or fellows in EM (population and context), which focused on the impact of gender on assessments (concept). We searched seven databases from the databases' inception to April 4, 2022. Two reviewers independently screened citations, completed full-text review, and abstracted data. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. RESULTS: A total of 667 unique citations were identified; 10 studies were included, and all were conducted within the United States. Four studies reported differences in EM resident assessments attributable to gender within workplace-based assessments (qualitative comments and quantitative scores) by both attending physicians and nonphysicians. Six studies investigating clinical competency committee scores, procedural scores, and simulation-based assessments did not report any significant differences attributable to gender. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review found that gender bias exists within EM resident assessment most notably at the level of narrative comments typically received via workplace-based assessments. As female EM residents receive higher rates of negative or critical comments and discordant feedback documented on assessment, these findings raise concern about added barriers female EM residents may face while progressing through residency and the impact on their clinical and professional development.",2022,Oct,AEM Educ Train,6,5,e10808,,10.1002/aet2.10808,36189450,#1048,Menchetti 2022,"",""
Gender bias in resident evaluations: Natural language processing and competency evaluation.,Andrews J; Chartash D; Hay S,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that female trainees experience evaluation penalties for gender non-conforming behaviour during medical training. Studies of medical education evaluations and performance scores do reflect a gender bias, though studies are of varying methodology and results have not been consistent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the differences in word use, competency themes and length within written evaluations of internal medicine residents at scale, considering the impact of both faculty and resident gender. We hypothesised that female internal medicine residents receive more negative feedback, and different thematic feedback than male residents. METHODS: This study utilised a corpus of 3864 individual responses to positive and negative questions over the course of six years (2012-2018) within Yale University School of Medicine's internal medicine residency. Researchers developed a sentiment model to assess the valence of evaluation responses. We then used natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate whether female versus male residents received more positive or negative feedback and if that feedback focussed on different Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies based on their gender. Evaluator-evaluatee gender dyad was analysed to see how it impacted quantity and quality of feedback. RESULTS: We found that female and male residents did not have substantively different numbers of positive or negative comments. While certain competencies were discussed more than others, gender did not seem to influence which competencies were discussed. Neither gender trainee received more written feedback, though female evaluators tended to write longer evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that when examined at scale, quantitative gender differences are not as prevalent as has been seen in qualitative work.

Assessment of Implicit Gender Bias During Evaluation of Procedural Competency Among Emergency Medicine Residents.,See A; Pallaci M; Aluisio AR; Beck-Esmay J; Menchine M; Weinstock M; Lam CN; Riddell J,"IMPORTANCE: Gender disparities exist throughout medicine. Recent studies have highlighted an attainment gap between male and female residents in performance evaluations on Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones. Because of difficulties in blinding evaluators to gender, it remains unclear whether these observed disparities are because of implicit bias or other causes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude of implicit gender bias in assessments of procedural competency in emergency medicine residents and whether the gender of the evaluator is associated with identified implicit gender bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 2018 to 2020 in which emergency medicine residency faculty assessed procedural competency by evaluating videos of residents performing 3 procedures in a simulated environment. They were blinded to the intent of the study. Proceduralists were filmed performing each procedure from 2 different viewpoints simultaneously by 2 different cameras. One was a gender-blinded (ie, hands-only) view, and the other a wide-angled gender-evident (ie, whole-body) view. The faculty evaluators viewed videos in a random order and assessed procedural competency on a global rating scale with extensive validity evidence for the evaluation of video-recorded procedural performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based on gender. The secondary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluations based on the gender of the evaluator. RESULTS: Fifty-one faculty evaluators enrolled from 19 states, with 22 male participants (43.1%), 29 female participants (56.9%), and a mean (SD) age of 37 (6.4) years. Each evaluator assessed all 60 procedures: 30 gender-blinded (hands-only view) videos and 30 identical gender-evident (wide angle) videos. There were no statistically significant differences in the study evaluators' scores of the proceduralists based on their gender, and the gender of the evaluator was not associated with the difference in mean scores.

Women's Wellness Through Equity and Leadership (WEL): A Program Evaluation.,Kelly EH; Miskimen T; Rivera F; Peterson LE; Hingle ST,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Women's Wellness through Equity and Leadership (WEL) program was developed as a collaboration between 6 major medical associations in the United States. The goal was to contribute to the creation of equitable work environments for women physicians. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the pilot implementation of WEL. METHODS: Participants included a diverse group of 18 early career to midcareer women physicians from across medical specialties, 3 from each partner organization. WEL was developed as an 18-month program with 3 series focused on wellness, equity, and leadership and included monthly virtual and in-person meetings. After institutional board review approval, a mixed-methods evaluation design was incorporated, which included postseries and postprogram surveys and in-depth telephone interviews. RESULTS: Participants delineated several drivers of program success, including peer support and/or networks; interconnectedness between the topics of wellness, equity, and leadership; and diversity of participants and faculty. Areas for improvement included more opportunities to connect with peers and share progress and more structured mentorship. Regarding program impact, participants reported increased knowledge and behavior change because of their participation.

Gender bias in the evaluation of interns in different medical specialties: An archival study.,Adar R; Kahalon R; Ullrich J; Afek A; Eisenberg VH,"INTRODUCTION: The field of medicine is characterized by within-field gender segregation: Gender ratios vary systematically by subdisciplines. This segregation might be, in part, due to gender bias in the assessment of women and men medical doctors. METHODS: We examined whether the assessments, i.e. overall score, department scores and skills scores, interns receive by their superiors during their internship year, vary as a function of their gender and the representation of women in the field. We analyzed an archival data set from a large hospital in Israel which included 3326 assessments that were given to all interns who completed their internship year between 2015 and 2019. RESULTS: Women received lower department scores and skills scores in fields with a low (versus high) representation of women. Men received higher scores in fields with a high (versus low) representation of men, yet there was no difference in their skills scores. CONCLUSIONS: Women are evaluated more negatively in fields with a low representation of women doctors. Similarly, men are evaluated more negatively in fields with a low representation of men, yet this cannot be explained by their skills.

A psychometric evaluation of the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale.,Parker RB; Parker PD; Larkin T; Cockburn J,"BACKGROUND: Gender bias within medical education is gaining increasing attention. However, valid and reliable measures are needed to adequately address and monitor this issue. This research conducts a psychometric evaluation of a short multidimensional scale that assesses medical students' awareness of gender bias, beliefs that gender bias should be addressed, and experience of gender bias during medical education. METHODS: Using students from the University of Wollongong, one pilot study and two empirical studies were conducted. The pilot study was used to scope the domain space (nâ=â28). This initial measure was extended to develop the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (GBMES). For Study 1 (nâ=â172), confirmatory factor analysis assessed the construct validity of the three-factor structure (awareness, beliefs, experience) and enabled deletion of redundant items. Study 2 (nâ=â457) tested the generalizability of the refined scale to a new sample. Combining Study 1 and 2, invariance testing for program of study and gender was explored. The relationship of the GBMES to demographic and gender politics variables was tested. The results were analyzed in R using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple-Indicator-Multiple-Indicator-Cause models. RESULTS: After analysis of the responses from the original 16-item GBMES (Study 1), a shortened measure of ten items fitted the data well (RMSEAâ=â.063; CFIâ=â.965; TLIâ=â.951; Mean R-square of itemsâ=â58.6Â %; reliability: .720-.910) and was found to generalize to a new sample in Study 2 (RMSEAâ=â.068; CFIâ=â.952; TLIâ=â.933; Mean R-square of itemsâ=â55.9Â %; reliability: .711-.892). The GBMES was found to be invariant across studies, gender, and program of study. Female students and those who supported gender equality had greater agreement for each of the factors. Likewise, postgraduate students reported higher scores on experience of gender bias than undergraduate students.

Student Evaluation of Faculty Physicians: Gender Differences in Teaching Evaluations.,Morgan HK; Purkiss JA; Porter AC; Lypson ML; Santen SA; Christner JG; Grum CM; Hammoud MM,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is a difference in medical student teaching evaluations for male and female clinical physician faculty. METHODS: The authors examined all teaching evaluations completed by clinical students at one North American medical school in the surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and internal medicine clinical rotations from 2008 to 2012. The authors focused on how students rated physician faculty on their ""overall quality of teaching"" using a 5-point response scale (1â=âPoor to 5â=âExcellent). Linear mixed-effects models provided estimated mean differences in evaluation outcomes by faculty gender. RESULTS: There were 14,107 teaching evaluations of 965 physician faculty.

Gender disparities in academic rank achievement in neurosurgery: a critical assessment.,Dossani RH; Terrell D; Kosty JA; Ross RC; Demand A; Wild E; Peterson R; Ngwenya LB; Benzil DL; Notarianni C,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether there are disparities in academic rank and promotion between men and women neurosurgeons. METHODS: The profiles of faculty members from 50 academic neurosurgery programs were reviewed to identify years in practice, number of PubMed-indexed publications, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) attainment, and academic rank. The number of publications at each academic rank was compared between men and women after controlling for years in practice by using a negative binomial regression model. The relationship between gender and each academic rank was also determined after controlling for clustering at the institutional level, years in practice, and number of publications. RESULTS: Of 841 faculty members identified, 761 (90%) were men (p = 0.0001). Women represented 12% of the assistant and associate professors but only 4% of the full professors. Men and women did not differ in terms of the percentage holding a PhD, years in practice, or number of publications at any academic rank.

Gender Bias in Simulation-Based Assessments of Emergency Medicine Residents.,Siegelman JN; Lall M; Lee L; Moran TP; Wallenstein J; Shah B,"BACKGROUND: Gender-related disparities persist in medicine and medical education. Prior work has found differences in medical education assessments based on gender. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that gender bias would be mitigated in a simulation-based assessment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of emergency medicine residents at a single, urban residency program. Beginning in spring 2013, residents participated in mandatory individual simulation assessments. Twelve simulated cases were included in this study. Rating forms mapped milestone language to specific observable behaviors. A Bayesian regression was used to evaluate the effect of resident and rater gender on assessment scores. Both 95% credible intervals (CrIs) and a Region of Practical Equivalence approach were used to evaluate the results. RESULTS: Participants included 48 faculty raters (25 men [52%]) and 102 residents (47 men [46%]).

Gender Differences in Patient Perceptions of Physicians' Communal Traits and the Impact on Physician Evaluations.,Chen H; Pierson E; Schmer-Galunder S; Altamirano J; Jurafsky D; Leskovec J; Fassiotto M; Kothary N,"Background: Communal traits, such as empathy, warmth, and consensus-building, are not highly valued in the medical hierarchy. Devaluing communal traits is potentially harmful for two reasons. First, data suggest that patients may prefer when physicians show communal traits. Second, if female physicians are more likely to be perceived as communal, devaluing communal traits may increase the gender inequity already prevalent in medicine. We test for both these effects. Materials and Methods: This study analyzed 22,431 Press Ganey outpatient surveys assessing 480 physicians collected from 2016 to 2017 at a large tertiary hospital. The surveys asked patients to provide qualitative comments and quantitative Likert-scale ratings assessing physician effectiveness. We coded whether patients described physicians with ""communal"" language using a validated word scale derived from previous work. We used multivariate logistic regressions to assess whether (1) patients were more likely to describe female physicians using communal language and (2) patients gave higher quantitative ratings to physicians they described with communal language, when controlling for physician, patient, and comment characteristics. Results: Female physicians had higher odds of being described with communal language than male physicians (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.40, pâ<â0.001). In addition, patients gave higher quantitative ratings to physicians they described with communal language. These results were robust to inclusion of controls. Conclusions: Female physicians are more likely to be perceived as communal. Being perceived as communal is associated with higher quantitative ratings, including likelihood to recommend.

Gender Disparity in Teaching Evaluations of Pediatric Faculty by Residents.,Shaw RS; Foo KL; Blumer A; Jacobson EL; Sturza J; Hartley S; Lukela JR; Sheffield V; Rappaport L,"OBJECTIVES: Despite their overrepresentation, female physicians continue to have lower rates of promotion compared with male physicians. Teaching evaluations play a role in physician advancement. Few studies have investigated gender disparity in resident evaluations of pediatric faculty. We hypothesized that gender disparities in resident evaluations of faculty exist and vary across subspecialties and primary work environments. METHODS: Pediatric faculty institution-specific evaluations completed by residents from January 1, 2015, to March 9, 2020, were obtained from a single academic center. Mean ratings of faculty performance were compared by gender using a Wilcoxon 2-sample test. RESULTS: Fifteen-thousand one-hundred and forty-two evaluations (5091 of male faculty and 10â051 of female faculty) were included. Female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.67 versus male = 4.65; P = .004). There was no statistical difference in the mean ratings of male and female faculty in the inpatient setting, whereas outpatient female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.79 versus male = 4.73; P = .005). For general pediatric faculty, females received higher ratings for overall teaching ability (female = 4.75 versus male = 4.70; P < .001). By contrast, there was no difference in ratings of subspecialty pediatric faculty. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric female faculty were statistically rated higher than male faculty in overall teaching ability, although these findings may not be educationally significant. The difference was driven by evaluations in the outpatient setting and for general pediatricians.

Assessment of Differences in Academic Rank and Compensation by Gender and Race/Ethnicity Among Academic Radiation Oncologists in the United States.,Raldow AC; Siker ML; Bonner JA; Chen Y; Liu FF; Metz JM; Movsas B; Potters L; Schultz CJ; Wilson E; Wang X; Romero T; Steinberg ML; Jagsi R,"PURPOSE: Advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion in the physician workforce is essential to providing high-quality and culturally responsive patient care and has been shown to improve patient outcomes. To better characterize equity in the field of radiation oncology, we sought to describe the current academic radiation oncology workforce, including any contemporary differences in compensation and rank by gender and race/ethnicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) 2018 Financial Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with associate or full professor rank. Compensation was compared by gender and race/ethnicity overall and stratified by rank and was further analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Of the 858 academic radiation oncologists from 63 departments in the United States in the sample, 33.2% were female, 65.2% were White, 27.2% were Asian, and 7.6% were underrepresented in medicine (URiM). There were 44.0% assistant professors, 32.0% associate professors, and 22.8% full professors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for factors associated with associate or full professor rank did not reveal statistically significant associations between gender or race/ethnicity with academic rank (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.32; PÂ =Â .48 for gender; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.5-1.30; PÂ =Â .37 for Asian vs White; and OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.31-1.55; PÂ =Â .37 for URiM vs White), but CIs were wide due to sample size, and point estimates were <1. Similarly, multivariable linear regression analysis modeling the log relative total compensation did not detect statistically significant differences between radiation oncologists by gender (-1.7%; 95% CI, -6.8% to 3.4%; PÂ =Â .51 for female vs male) or race/ethnicity (-1.6%; 95% CI, -7.3% to 4.0%; PÂ =Â .57 for Asian vs White and -3.0%; 95% CI, -12.1% to 6.0%; PÂ =Â .51 for URiM vs White). CONCLUSIONS: The low numbers of women and faculty with URiM race/ethnicity in this radiation oncology faculty sample limits the ability to compare career trajectory and compensation by those characteristics.

Gender equity programmes in academic medicine: a realist evaluation approach to Athena SWAN processes.,Caffrey L; Wyatt D; Fudge N; Mattingley H; Williamson C; McKevitt C,"OBJECTIVES: Gender inequity has persisted in academic medicine. Yet equity is vital for countries to achieve their full potential in terms of translational research and patient benefit. This study sought to understand how the gender equity programme, Athena SWAN, can be enabled and constrained by interactions between the programme and the context it is implemented into, and whether these interactions might produce unintended consequences. DESIGN: Multimethod qualitative case studies using a realist evaluation approach. SETTING: 5 departments from a university medical school hosting a Translational Research Organisation. PARTICIPANTS: 25âhours of observations of gender equality committee meetings, 16 in-depth interviews with Heads of Departments, Committee Leads and key personnel involved in the initiative. 4 focus groups with 15 postdoctoral researchers, lecturers and senior lecturers. RESULTS: The implementation of Athena SWAN principles was reported to have created social space to address gender inequity and to have highlighted problematic practices to staff. However, a number of factors reduced the programme's potential to impact gender inequity. Gender inequity was reproduced in the programme's enactment as female staff was undertaking a disproportionate amount of Athena SWAN work, with potential negative impacts on individual women's career progression. Early career researchers experienced problems accessing Athena SWAN initiatives. Furthermore, the impact of the programme was perceived to be undermined by wider institutional practices, national policies and societal norms, which are beyond the programme's remit. CONCLUSIONS: Gender equity programmes have the potential to address inequity. However, paradoxically, they can also unintentionally reproduce and reinforce gender inequity through their enactment. Potential programme impacts may be undermined by barriers to staff availing of career development and training initiatives, and by wider institutional practices, national policies and societal norms.",2016,Sep,BMJ Open,6,9,e012090,,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012090,27609850,#1065,Caffrey 2016,"",""

DESIGN: This study involved three sequential phases: 1) scoping review that identified strategies to improve gender equity in all medical specialties; 2) modified consensus process with 48 CCM stakeholders to rate and rank identified strategies; and 3) in-person stakeholder meeting to refine strategies and discuss facilitators and barriers to their implementation. SETTING: CCM. SUBJECTS: CCM stakeholders (physicians, researchers, and decision-makers; mutually inclusive). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 190 unique strategies from 416 articles. Strategies were grouped thematically into 20 categories across four overarching pillars of equity: access, participation, reimbursement, and culture. Participants prioritized 22 improvement strategies for implementation in CCM. The top-rated strategy from each pillar included: 1) nominate gender diverse candidates for faculty positions and prestigious opportunities (equitable access); 2) mandate training in unconscious bias and equitable treatment for committee (e.g., hiring, promotion) members (equitable participation); 3) ensure equitable starting salaries regardless of sex or gender (equitable reimbursement); and, 4) conduct 360Â° evaluations of leaders (including their direct work circle of supervisors, peers, and subordinates) through a diversity lens (equitable culture). Interprofessional collaboration, leadership, and local champions were identified as key enablers for implementation.

Gender Disparity in Pediatric Surgery: An Evaluation of Pediatric Surgery Conference Participation.,Lee SY; Mor S; Lazar SV; Hassan AS; Farmer DL; Brown EG,"BACKGROUND: Leadership in academic conferences is an important factor for academic advancement. Underrepresentation of women in academic surgical conferences has been demonstrated in other subspecialties, but it has not been well-studied in pediatric surgery. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study analyzes conference participation at 2 national pediatric surgery annual conference programs from 2003 to 2022. Moderator, speakers, and research presenter sex was collected. The primary outcome was the proportion of female participants in each of these roles. Mann-Kendall trend test was conducted to assess for significance. RESULTS: Across 29 meetings, a total of 523 sessions were examined. Overall, female participation in all roles increased from 2003 to 2022. There were statistically positive trends of female participation in leadership roles as moderator (pÂ =Â 0.003) and speaker (pÂ =Â 0.01), with moderator role demonstrating the largest proportional female increase over time - with a 7-fold increase from 7.1% in 2003 to 50.0% in 2022. There was also a significant increasing trend in female participation as research presenters (pÂ <Â 0.01) from 25.4% to 46.4%.

Assessment of Gender-Based Linguistic Differences in Physician Trainee Evaluations of Medical Faculty Using Automated Text Mining.,Heath JK; Weissman GE; Clancy CB; Shou H; Farrar JT; Dine CJ,"IMPORTANCE: Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender. OBJECTIVE: To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1- and 2-word phrases. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]).

An Evaluation of Sex-Based Differences in Surrogate Consent for Older Adults Undergoing Surgical Intervention.,Nagarkatti N; Miller SM; Ahuja V; Schneider EB; Mohanty S; Kodadek LM,"INTRODUCTION: Differences between female and male patients have been identified in many facets of medicine. We sought to understand whether differences in frequency of surrogate consent for operation exist between older female and male patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was designed using data from the hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients age 65Â y and older who underwent operation between 2014 and 2018 were included. RESULTS: Of 51,618 patients identified, 3405 (6.6%) had surrogate consent for surgery. Overall, 7.7% of females had surrogate consent compared to 5.3% of males (PÂ <Â 0.001). Stratified analysis based on age categories showed no difference in surrogate consent between female and male patients aged 65-74Â yy (2.3% versus 2.6%, PÂ =Â 0.16), but higher rates of surrogate consent in females than males among patients aged 75-84Â y old (7.3% versus 5.6%, PÂ <Â 0.001) and age â¥85Â y (29.7% versus 20.8%, PÂ <Â 0.001).

"Intersecting gender, evaluations, and examinations: Averting gender bias in an obstetrics and gynecology clerkship in the United States.",Jacques L; Kaljo K; Treat R; Davis J; Farez R; Lund M,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether gender bias was present in the final third-year medical student obstetrics/gynecology clerkship performance evaluation completed by faculty and resident physicians. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of third-year medical students over the course of ten years (2004 - 2014) at a private medical school in the northern US state of Wisconsin. Each student's performance during their required 6-week obstetrics/gynecology clerkship was assessed by a combination of the student's scores on a clinical performance evaluation and on a standardized national subject examination. The clinical performance evaluations are comprised of 10 domains, each using a 9-point Likert scale and completed by faculty and resident physicians. All clerkships at our institution use the same evaluation form, which was designed and validated by the medical education statistics department. Final obstetrics/gynecology clerkship average clinical evaluation scores (Scale 1-9) and obstetrics/gynecology standardized national subject examination scores (Percentile 1-99) were compared to see if a gender based difference between subject examination and performance evaluation scores existed. RESULTS: 1,976 student records were analyzed. Mean standardized national subject exam scores were significantly higher for females [74.4 (8.1)] than males [72.9 (8.2)] (Possible range 1-99) with Cohen's d = 0.2 (P = 0.001).

"Gender bias in sports medicine: an international assessment of sports medicine physicians' perceptions of their interactions with athletes, coaches, athletic trainers and other physicians.",Tsukahara Y; Novak M; Takei S; Asif IM; Yamasawa F; Torii S; Akama T; Matsumoto H; Day C,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the difference between female and male sports medicine physicians regarding disrespectful attitudes and sexual harassment perceived from athletes, coaches, physicians, athletic trainers (ATs) and organisations/administrations. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: anonymous survey was distributed to sports medicine physicians practicing in 51 countries. Ï(2) analysis was used to detect differences between female and male sports medicine physicians and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent variables that affect disrespectful attitudes and sexual harassment from sports participants. RESULTS: 1193 sports medicine physicians (31.9% female) participated from 51 countries. The survey revealed that female physicians, compared with male physicians, perceive significantly more disrespect or have their judgement questioned more by the following categories: male and female athletes, male and female coaches, female physicians with more years of experience, male physicians (regardless of years of experience), male and female ATs and organisation/administrations (all p<0.05). The only category where the frequency of disrespect was perceived equally by male and female physicians was during their interactions with female physicians who have the same or lesser years of experience. Female sports medicine physicians noted more sexual harassment than male physicians during interactions with male athletes, coaches, ATs and physicians (all p<0.001). In the logistic regression, gender was a related factor for perceiving disrespect, especially from male coaches (OR=2.01) and physicians with more years of experience (OR=2.18).

"Gender and Ethnicity Bias of Text-to-Image Generative Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging, Part 1: Preliminary Evaluation.",Currie G; Hewis J; Hawk E; Rohren E,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) text-to-image production could reinforce or amplify gender and ethnicity biases. Several text-to-image generative AI tools are used for producing images that represent the medical imaging professions. White male stereotyping and masculine cultures can dissuade women and ethnically divergent people from being drawn into a profession. Methods: In March 2024, DALL-E 3, Firefly 2, Stable Diffusion 2.1, and Midjourney 5.2 were utilized to generate a series of individual and group images of medical imaging professionals: radiologist, nuclear medicine physician, radiographer, and nuclear medicine technologist. Multiple iterations of images were generated using a variety of prompts. Collectively, 184 images were produced for evaluation of 391 characters. All images were independently analyzed by 3 reviewers for apparent gender and skin tone. Results: Collectively (individual and group characters) (n = 391), 60.6% were male and 87.7% were of a light skin tone. DALL-E 3 (65.6%), Midjourney 5.2 (76.7%), and Stable Diffusion 2.1 (56.2%) had a statistically higher representation of men than Firefly 2 (42.9%) (P < 0.0001). With Firefly 2, 70.3% of characters had light skin tones, which was statistically lower (P < 0.0001) than for Stable Diffusion 2.1 (84.8%), Midjourney 5.2 (100%), and DALL-E 3 (94.8%). Overall, image quality metrics were average or better in 87.2% for DALL-E 3 and 86.2% for Midjourney 5.2, whereas 50.9% were inadequate or poor for Firefly 2 and 86.0% for Stable Diffusion 2.1. Conclusion: Generative AI text-to-image generation using DALL-E 3 via GPT-4 has the best overall quality compared with Firefly 2, Midjourney 5.2, and Stable Diffusion 2.1.

Gender differences in substance use and psychiatric distress among medical students: A comprehensive statewide evaluation.,Merlo LJ; Curran JS; Watson R,"BACKGROUND: Medical student wellness has emerged as an important issue in medical education. The purpose of the present study was to obtain a comprehensive assessment of substance use, psychological distress, and help-seeking among male and female medical students in order to identify targets for continued intervention efforts. METHODS: Medical students from all 9 medical schools in the state of Florida were invited via e-mail and/or announcements to complete an anonymous online questionnaire assessing their well-being. Of 5053 matriculating medical students, 1137 (57.1% female) responded to the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and chi-square analyses were computed using SPSS 20. RESULTS: Over 70% of students acknowledged binge drinking, with men reporting higher frequency than women (Ï(2) = 13.90, P = .003), and 22.7% (n = 201) reported marijuana use during medical school, with higher rates (Ï(2) = 9.50, P = .02) among men (27.0%, n = 99) than women (18.9%, n = 93).

Sex differentials are well documented in children younger than 5 years but have not been systematically examined for ages 5-24 years. We aimed to estimate the sex ratio of mortality from birth to age 24 years and reconstruct trends in sex-specific mortality between 1990 and 2021 for 200 countries, major regions, and the world. METHODS: We compiled comprehensive databases on the mortality sex ratio (ratio of male to female mortality rates) for individuals aged 0-4 years, 5-14 years, and 15-24 years. The databases contain mortality rates from death registration systems, full birth and sibling histories from surveys, and reports on household deaths in censuses. We modelled the sex ratio of age-specific mortality as a function of the mortality in both sexes using Bayesian hierarchical time-series models. We report the levels and trends of sex ratios and estimate the expected female mortality and excess female mortality rates (the difference between the estimated female mortality and the expected female mortality) to identify countries with outlying sex ratios. FINDINGS: Globally, the mortality sex ratio was 1Â·13 (ie, boys were more likely to die than girls of the same age) for ages 0-4 years (90% uncertainty interval 1Â·11 to 1Â·15) in 2021. This ratio increased with age to 1Â·16 (1Â·12 to 1Â·20) for 5-14 years, reaching 1Â·65 for 15-24 years (1Â·52 to 1Â·75). In all age groups, the global sex ratio of mortality increased between 1990 and 2021, driven by faster declines in female mortality. In 2021, the probability of a newborn male reaching age 25 years was 94Â·1% (93Â·7 to 94Â·4), compared with 95Â·1% for a newborn female (94Â·7 to 95Â·3). We found a disadvantage of females versus males (compared with countries with similar total mortality) in 2021 in five countries for ages 0-4 years (Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, and Iran), one country (Suriname) for ages 5-14 years, and 13 countries for ages 15-24 years (including Bangladesh and India). We found the reverse pattern (disadvantage of males vs females compared with countries of similar total mortality) in one country in ages 0-4 years (Vietnam) and eight countries in ages 15-24 years (including Brazil and Mexico). Globally, the number of excess female deaths from birth to age 24 years was 86â563 (-6059 to 164â000) in 2021, down from 544â636 (453â982 to 633â265) in 1990. INTERPRETATION: The global sex ratio of mortality for all age groups in the first 25 years of life increased between 1990 and 2021. Targeted interventions should focus on countries with outlying sex ratios of mortality to reduce disparities due to discrimination in health care, nutrition, and violence.

Gender Differences in Language of Standardized Letter of Evaluation Narratives for Emergency Medicine Residency Applicants.,Li S; Fant AL; McCarthy DM; Miller D; Craig J; Kontrick A,"OBJECTIVE: While gender differences in language for letters of recommendation have been identified in other fields, no prior studies have evaluated the narrative portion of the emergency medicine (EM) standardized letter of evaluation (SLOE). We aim to examine the differences in language used to describe male and female applicants within the SLOE narrative. METHODS: Invited applicants to a 4-year academic EM residency program within a single application year with a SLOE were included in the sample. Exclusion criteria were SLOE of applicants from non-Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) schools or first rotation SLOE not available for download. Data were collected on applicant gender, age, rotation grade, Alpha Omega Alpha designation, and medical school rank. The previously validated Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program was used to analyze frequency of words within categories relevant to letters of recommendation. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square tests were employed in analysis. RESULTS: Of 1,025 applicants within a single application year, 265 were invited to interview; 237 applicants had a first rotation SLOE available for analysis. There were no differences between male and female applicants for baseline characteristics. The median word count per SLOE narrative was 199; within the LIWC dictionary and user-defined categories, words within the categories of affiliation and ability appeared more frequently for female applicants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with respect to the SLOE narrative reinforce prior research that letters of recommendation for female applicants highlight communal characteristics of teamwork, helpfulness, and compassion. Contrary to prior research, ability words highlighting intelligence and skill appeared with greater frequency for female applicants. No pervasive differences were found in other word categories. In this sample, the standardized format of the SLOE resulted in letters that were relatively free of gender bias.",2017,Oct,AEM Educ Train,1,4,334-339,,10.1002/aet2.10057,30051052,#1081,Li 2017,"",""
Gender Disparity in Surgery: An Evaluation of Surgical Societies.,Lyons NB; Bernardi K; Huang L; Holihan JL; Cherla D; Martin AC; Milton A; Loor M; Ko TC; Liang MK; Hydo L,"Background: The percentage of female surgeons and surgery residents has increased slowly to 24% and 35%, respectively. However, women remain under-represented in surgical leadership positions (<20%). Society awards and leadership positions are used for hiring and promoting surgeons. We hypothesized that within the Surgical Infection Society (SIS), females are under-represented. Methods: The SIS website and databases were consulted for the number of female members, awardees, and leaders. Representation was divided into four time periods: 2000-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2017 and compared for changes over time utilizing a Î§(2) test. In addition, we reviewed the council members of five other surgical societies and compared the percentage of female representation in leadership positions. Results: Since the SIS was founded, there have been 587 members of whom only 135 (23%) are female. There has been an increase in female membership over time (pâ<â0.001). The number of female awardees rose from 37% during the first two study periods to more than 50% in the last two periods (pâ=â0.002). However, female representation in leadership positions decreased from 26% in 2000-2005 to less than 15% in the last three study periods (pâ=â0.234). Similar disparities emerged when comparing the SIS with other surgical societies: Women have represented only 24% (range 8%-42%) of leaders and 4% (range 0-11%) of society presidents.

This study assesses how medical students' gender-based perceptions of surgical careers are impacted by attending the Surgical Exploration and Discovery (SEAD) program, a 2-week, immersive procedural program that offers observerships, mentorship, and workshops across 8 surgical specialties. DESIGN: In this mixed-method prospective cohort study, medical students' awareness, beliefs, and experiences of gender bias in surgery were assessed using a 10-item Gender Bias in Medical Students Assessment-Surgery (GBMSA-S) psychometric survey instrument inspired by the validated Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (Parker et al., 2016). SETTING: Undergraduate Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen first-year medical students in the experimental group (8 male, 10 female) and 18 in the control group (7 male, 11 female). RESULTS: Compared to the control group, SEAD participants had significant changes in agreement with the statements: ""surgery is male-dominated,"" ""medical studies are mainly done in males,"" ""gender discrimination is more pronounced in surgery than other medical professions,"" ""consideration of my gender is an important factor in whether or not to pursue surgery as a career,"" and ""I have encountered gender-biased attitudes and/or behaviors among non-physician health care staff"" (p < 0.05). Perceptions of gender bias were reduced post-SEAD. Subgroup analysis by gender suggested that the significance of these changing perspectives was due to female participants' responses.

The Standardized Letter of Evaluation Narrative: Differences in Language Use by Gender.,Miller DT; McCarthy DM; Fant AL; Li-Sauerwine S; Ali A; Kontrick AV,"INTRODUCTION: Prior research demonstrates gender differences in language used in letters of recommendation. The emergency medicine (EM) Standardized Letter of Evaluation (SLOE) format limits word count and provides detailed instructions for writers. The objective of this study is to examine differences in language used to describe men and women applicants within the SLOE narrative. METHODS: All applicants to a four-year academic EM residency program within a single application year with a first rotation SLOE available were included in the sample. We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program to analyze word frequency within 16 categories. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared, and t-tests were used to describe the sample; gender differences in word frequency were tested for using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Of 1117 applicants to the residency program, 822 (82%) first-rotation SLOEs were available; 64% were men, and 36% were women. We did not find a difference in baseline characteristics including age (mean 27 years), top 25 schools (22.5%), Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society rates (13%), and having earned advanced degrees (10%). The median word count per SLOE narrative for men was 171 and for women was 180 (p = 0.15). After adjusting for letter length, word frequency differences between genders were only present in two categories: social words (women: 23 words/letter; men: 21 words/letter, p = 0.02) and ability words (women: 2 words/letter; men: 1 word/letter, p = 0.04). We were unable to detect a statistical difference between men and women applicants in the remaining categories, including words representing communal traits, agentic traits, standout adjectives, grindstone traits, teaching words, and research words.

Disparity in Gender Representation of Speakers at National Emergency Medical Services Conferences: A Current Assessment and Proposed Path Forward.,Davic A; Carey E; Lambert E; Luckingham T; Mongiello N; Peralta R; Puccio N; Rivera K; Torre K; Maloney LM,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparities between Emergency Medicine physicians with regards to salary, promotion, and scholarly recognition as national conference speakers have been well-documented. However, little is known if similar gender disparities impact their out-of-hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) colleagues. Although there have been improvements in the ratio of women entering the EMS workforce, gender representation has improved at a slower rate for paramedics compared to emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Since recruitment, retention, and advancement of females within a specialty have been associated with the visibility of prominent, respected female leaders, gender disparity of these leaders as national conference speakers may contribute to the ""leaky pipeline effect"" seen within the EMS profession. Gender representation of these speakers has yet to be described objectively. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if disparity exists in gender representation of speakers at well-known national EMS conferences and trade shows in the United States (US) from 2016-2020. The secondary objective was to determine if males were more likely than females to return to a conference as a speaker in subsequent years. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of programs from well-known national conferences, specifically for EMS providers, which were held in the US from 2016-2020 was performed. Programs were abstracted for type of conference session (pre-conference, keynote, main conference) and speakers' names. Speaker gender (male, female) was confirmed via internet search. RESULTS: Seventeen conference programs were obtained with 1,709 conference sessions that had a total of 2,731 listed speaker names, of whom 537 (20%) were female. A total of 30 keynote addresses had 39 listed speaker names of whom six (15%) were female. No significant difference was observed in the number of years males returned to present at the same conference as compared to females. CONCLUSION: Gender representation of speakers at national EMS conferences in the US is not reflective of the current best estimate of the US EMS workforce. This disparity exists not only in the overall percent of female names listed as speakers, but also in the percent of individual female speakers, and is most pronounced within keynote speakers. Online lecture platforms, as an unintentional consequent of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with intentional speaker development and mentorship initiatives, may reduce barriers to facilitating a new pipeline for more females to become speakers at national EMS conferences.",2021,Aug,Prehosp Disaster Med,36,4,445-449,,10.1017/S1049023X21000571,34190038,#1086,Davic 2021,"",""

Patient data were collected from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation. The outcome was defined as the examination or rehabilitation that was specified in the patient's record. RESULTS: Men had a significantly higher likelihood than women of being recommended physiotherapy and radiological examination, and the gender difference was not explained by confounding variables and covariates (age, marital status, ethnicity, education, working status, pain severity, pain interference, pain sites, anxiety and depression). There was no significant gender difference in recommendations to treatment by specialist physician, occupational therapist, psychologist or social worker.

"Ecological momentary assessment of daily discrimination experiences and nicotine, alcohol, and drug use among sexual and gender minority individuals.",Livingston NA; Flentje A; Heck NC; Szalda-Petree A; Cochran BN,"OBJECTIVE: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience elevated rates of minority stress, which has been linked to higher rates of nicotine and substance use. Research on this disparity to date is largely predicated on methodology that is insensitive to within day SGM-based discrimination experiences, or their relation to momentary nicotine and substance use risk. We address this knowledge gap in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). METHOD: Fifty SGM individuals, between 18 and 45 years of age, were recruited from an inland northwestern university, regardless of their nicotine or substance use history, and invited to participate in an EMA study. Each were prompted to provide data, six times daily (between 10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.) for 14 days, regarding SGM-based discrimination, other forms of mistreatment, and nicotine, drug, and alcohol use since their last prompt. RESULTS: Discrimination experiences that occurred since individuals' last measurement prompt were associated with greater odds of nicotine and substance use during the same measurement window. Substance use was also more likely to occur in relation to discrimination reported two measurements prior in lagged models. Relative to other forms of mistreatment, discrimination effects were consistently larger in magnitude and became stronger throughout the day/evening. CONCLUSION: This study adds to existing minority stress research by highlighting the both immediate and delayed correlates of daily SGM-based discrimination experiences. These results also contribute to our understanding of daily stress processes and provide insight into ways we might mitigate these effects using real-time monitoring and intervention technology.

This was a cross-sectional survey study among 1,988 patients at a university Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine outpatient clinic. To assess DIF, WHODAS 2.0 items were dichotomized as `none' rated by respondents as `0' versus `any limitation' rated as `1,2,3 or 4'. The item response theory analysis was used to define discrimination and difficulty parameters of a questionnaire. The probit logistic regression was used to test uniformity of DIF between gender groups. The results of DIF analysis were presented and evaluated graphically as item characteristic curves based on 2-parameter IRT analysis of dichotomized responses. High to perfect discrimination ability was observed for all the items except one. Difficulty levels of eight items were shifted towards the elevated disability level, four items demonstrated a perfect difficulty property. Significant DIF between genders was observed in seven of 12 items. The detected DIFs were uniform. For item `household', `emotional affection' and `work', men had to experience slightly worse disability than women to achieve the same score. A reverse effect was observed for items `concentration', `washing', `dressing' and dealing with strangers. In this study, significant DIF between genders was found in seven of twelve items of 12-item WHODAS 2.0. amongst 1988 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. All the detected DIFs were uniform. Regardless gender-related DIF shown in seven out of 12 items, we recommend using and studying 12-item WHODAS 2.0 in different populations.",2019,Dec,Int J Rehabil Res,42,4,316-321,,10.1097/MRR.0000000000000365,31425347,#1092,Katajapuu 2019,"",""
A Protocol to Assess Contextual Factors During Program Impact Evaluation: A Case Study of a STEM Gender Equity Intervention in Higher Education.,Nobrega S; Edwards K; Ghaziri ME; Giacobbe L; Rice S; Punnett L,"Program evaluations that lack experimental design often fail to produce evidence of impact because there is no available control group. Theory-based evaluations can generate evidence of a program's causal effects if evaluators collect evidence along the theorized causal chain and identify possible competing causes. However, few methods are available for assessing competing causes in the program environment. Effect Modifier Assessment (EMA) is a method previously used in smaller-scale studies to assess possible competing causes of observed changes following an intervention. In our case study of a university gender equity intervention, EMA generated useful evidence of competing causes to augment program evaluation. Top-down administrative culture, poor experiences with hiring and promotion, and workload were identified as impeding forces that might have reduced program benefits. The EMA addresses a methodological gap in theory-based evaluation and might be useful in a variety of program settings.",2023,May,Am J Eval,45,4,,,10.1177/10982140231152281,39664915,#1093,Nobrega 2023,"",""
Social Inequity and Structural Barriers to Completion of Ecological Momentary Assessments for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men and Trans Women Living With HIV in San Francisco.,Turner CM; Arayasirikul S; Trujillo D; LÃª V; Wilson EC,"BACKGROUND: Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) administered via text messaging facilitate real-time data collection. With widespread cell phone access, EMAs are becoming more available to even the most disenfranchised communities, such as those living with HIV. However, structural barriers disproportionately burden young men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans women (TW) living with HIV and threaten participation in HIV research. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify structural barriers to completing EMA text surveys nested within a digital HIV care intervention for young MSM and TW living with HIV in San Francisco. METHODS: A total of 10,800 EMA text messages were delivered daily over 90 days to 120 participants enrolled in the Health eNav intervention (2017-2018) at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. EMA surveys inquired about participants' daily affect, sexual behaviors, substance use, and treatment adherence. Survey completion was calculated after 30, 60, and 90 days of follow-up. We described characteristics of nonstarters (those who provided less than four complete responses to the first seven EMA surveys) and analyzed structural correlates of days to first weeklong or more EMA survey noncompletion using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Qualitative interviews were used to evaluate the acceptability of EMA surveys. RESULTS: Participants completed 4384 of 10,800 (40.59%) EMA surveys. Completion of 70% or more of EMA surveys was attained by 56 of 120 participants (46.7%) at 30 days of follow-up, 40/120 (33.3%) at 60 days of follow-up, and 30/120 (25.0%) by the end of the 90-day study period. Twenty-eight participants (23.3%) were identified as nonstarters, and were more likely to be recently incarcerated (prevalence ratio [PR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.4), forego basic needs for HIV medications (PR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5), and be diagnosed with HIV in the last year (PR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.1). Adjusting for nonstarters, young MSM and TW living in temporary/transitional housing (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0), foregoing HIV medications to afford basic needs (aHR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7), and having less than a college education (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-9.0) had greater hazard of weeklong or more EMA survey noncompletion. Overall, there was high acceptability of the EMA surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Although access to and use of technology is increasingly ubiquitous, this analysis demonstrates persisting gaps in EMA completion by socioeconomic factors such as incarceration, education level, housing, and competing needs for young MSM and TW living with HIV in San Francisco. Moreover, those recently diagnosed with HIV were more likely to experience an immediate drop-off in completing EMA surveys. EMAs are feasible for individuals not experiencing social inequity and structural barriers. HIV prevention technologies addressing these barriers and leveraging similar methodology may prove effective for young MSM and TW living with HIV.",2019,May,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,7,5,e13241,,10.2196/13241,31066714,#1094,Turner 2019,"",""
