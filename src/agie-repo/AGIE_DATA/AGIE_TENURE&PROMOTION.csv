The application of andragogy for the advanced diploma program in education at Saudi Arabia's Taif university,"Aljohani, Obaidalah H.; Alajlan, Sarah M.","This study's aim was to explore advanced diploma program students' perceptions about the application and importance of andragogy. The study also investigated if there is a difference, by gender, among the learners' point of view about the application and importance of andragogy to the learning environment. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized. The study population included all learners (n = 1,235) who were studying with Taif University's advanced diploma program in education. The study findings revealed that the importance of the five andragogical assumptions (motivation, experience, need to know, readiness to learn, and self-directedness) for the learners. There were statistically significant differences (α = 0.05), due to gender, among the students' perceptions about the learners' need to know; these differences were seen for both the application and importance of the andragogical principles; the variations favored females. Therefore, teachers should employ learning strategies that encourage self-directed learning among students. © 2021 IGI Global.

A personal values view of international entrepreneurial intention,"Ammeer, M.A.; Haddoud, M.Y.; Onjewu, A.-K.E.","Purpose Recognising the shortage of research investigating the effect of individual characteristics in cross-border entrepreneurship, this study models the dimensions of personal values as predictors of international entrepreneurship. Also, noting the paucity of evidence on the influence of ethnicity and gender in the personal values and international entrepreneurship nexus, the study undertakes a multi-group analysis to clarify the moderating effects of these social antecedents in the context of Mauritius. Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data from Mauritius is examined using a sample of 504 students spread across six universities. The analysis takes a structural equation modelling approach. Findings The results show that, comparing the distinct personal values dimensions, international entrepreneurship has a positive association with self-enhancement and openness to change. Furthermore, it has a non-significant relationship with self-transcendence and a negative connection with conservation. Also, the multi-group analyses revealed significant differences in the individual correlations across gender and ethnic categories. Originality/value Building on emerging empirical interest in the literature, this study presents novel evidence of the link between personal values and international entrepreneurial intention in the context of Mauritius. Additionally, examining the moderating influence of ethnicity and gender in the personal values, international entrepreneurship nexus advances current literature. On a practical level, the study offers insights to universities and other stakeholders tasked with nurturing international entrepreneurial behaviour among students to contemplate personal and social antecedents and, accordingly, adapt their entrepreneurship pedagogy.",2022,/,International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior & Research,28,3,577-601,,10.1108/IJEBR-06-2021-0480,,#3,Ammeer 2022,"",""
Income Inequality in Patients (Pts) with Locally Advanced (LA) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Receiving Proton BeamTherapy,"Konski, X.A.A.; Iocolano, M.; Yegya-Raman, N.; Cohen, R.; Langer, C.; Friedes, C.; Cengel, K.A.; Levin, W.P.; Lariviere, M.J.; Bradley, J.D.; Feigenberg, S.J.","Purpose/Objective(s)Proton beam therapy (PBT) use is limited by availability of PBT units and reimbursement. Health inequity in the use of PBT can exist based upon insurance coverage and access to PBT units. The concentration index (CI) is one measure used to quantify health inequity. CI use in identifying health inequity as it pertains to PBT use has not been documented to date. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with PBT versus conventional radiotherapy (CRT) receipt and perform a health equity analysis in patients with LA-NSCLC.Materials/MethodsPts with LA-NSCLC treated between January 2011 and December 2021 at an academic medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Primary endpoint was treatment with PBT. Secondary endpoint was whether a health inequity existed according to the CI. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine any association between use of PBT and various sociodemographic variables including age, race, gender, median household income, and insurance type (Medicare vs other). Differences between continuous variables were investigated via a two-sided t-test and categorical variables via chi-square test. The Wagstaff correction of the CI was used to determine health inequity. The R statistical package was used for all statistical analyses (https://www.R-project.org/).ResultsOf a total of 594 pts, 293 received PBT and 301 received CRT. Pts treated with PBT were older, 69.7 vs 64, p<0.001, had higher median household income, $84,254 vs $74,310, p<0.001, were more likely to be White, p<0.001, live further away from the center, p = 0.023 and had Medicare insurance, p<0.001. Univariate analysis found age, race, income, distance, and insurance type to predict significantly for PBT use. On multivariate analysis, only Medicare, (p<0.001) predicting for PBT use. The CI was 0.178 (95% CI: 0.086-.27). A positive Concentration Index indicates a higher proportion of use of PBT among financially better off pts.ConclusionThis is the first analysis to show that pts with Medicare insurance were more likely to receive PBT for LA-NSCLC. This result is unsurprising, as most commercial insurance plans do not regularly reimburse the use of PBT. A positive CI indicates a disproportionate concentration of PBT use among the financially better off. Although distance to the proton beam center was longer in pts receiving PBT, there was no correlation between distance and income. Lower income pts may not have the resources to research and seek PBT. These results need confirmation in a larger dataset with a more diverse pt population. Further interventions are needed to lessen inequity and provide access to unique technologies to everyone.

Investigating the determinants of starting salary of IT graduates,"Ge, Chunmian; Kankanhalli, Atreyi; Huang, Ke-Wei","The starting salary of a fresh graduate is considered a potential indicator of career advancement. Yet few studies have examined the determinants of starting salaries of information technology (IT) graduates. Further, existing studies have focused on how demographics affect either the salary or the kind of job the graduate enters into, but rarely both. In this paper, we explore both and examine if entry into an IT job mediates the effects of demographics on the starting salaries of fresh IT graduates. Our model is tested using data from annual surveys of undergraduate students majoring in IT at a large public university in Singapore over a 5-year period. We find that gender and foreigner status influence both starting salary and fresh graduates' entry into an IT vs. non IT job. Further, the effect of gender on the starting salaries of IT graduates is partially mediated by their entry into an IT job. In other words, part of the reason for a gender difference in starting salary could be attributed to female IT majors being less likely to enter IT jobs upon graduation than their male counterparts. On the other hand, foreign IT graduates are more likely to enter IT jobs, yet their starting salaries are found to be lower than local graduates. The implications of the results for research and practice are discussed.",2015,,Data Base for Advances in Information Systems,46,4,9-25,,10.1145/2843824.2843826,,#5,Ge 2015,"",""
Does gender matter? Exploring perceptions regarding health technologies among employees and students at a medical university,"Haluza, Daniela; Wernhart, Anna","With the emergence of an always-on culture and the private smartphones always within reach, professional and recreational contexts overlap. Little empirical knowledge is available on prevailing online habits among healthcare personnel and whether gender matters in this context. To investigate health technology-related preferences, we conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of employees and students at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. In total, 905 participants (59.0%, 540/905, females) provided self-reported information on use of online services and mobile health applications (apps) as well as respective gender-specific internal and external apperceptions. Mann-Whitney U tests and binary regression analysis assessed respective gender differences. The structured German questionnaire was validated by principal component analysis. The study found a moderate familiarity with health technologies. As for gender differences, prevailing health app use was high among both male and female participants (39, 141/365, and 42%, 229/540, respectively), with apps for tracking activity and nutrition habits most commonly used. Approval for monitoring health and lifestyle parameters, eHealth and telemedicine knowledge levels, and online health information retrieval predicted health app use, whereas gender did not. Socio-demographic attributes including gender influence not only private online habits of users, but might also affect acceptance of health technologies and their professional use in a clinical setting. Thus, addressing the gender dimension already in concept stages of digital devices and services for healthcare and lifestyle could speed up private and public adoption of health technologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,International Journal of Medical Informatics,130,,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.08.008,,#7,Haluza 2019,"",""
Provincial and gridded population projection for China under shared socioeconomic pathways from 2010 to 2100,Yidan Chen; Fang Guo; Jiachen Wang; Wenjia Cai; Can Wang; Kaicun Wang,"In response to a growing demand for subnational and spatially explicit data on China’s future population, this study estimates China’s provincial population from 2010 to 2100 by age (0–100+), sex (male and female) and educational levels (illiterate, primary school, junior-high school, senior-high school, college, bachelor’s, and master’s and above) under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The provincial projection takes into account fertility promoting policies and population ceiling restrictions of megacities that have been implemented in China in recent years to reduce systematic biases in current studies. The predicted provincial population is allocated to spatially explicit population grids for each year at 30 arc-seconds resolution based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) urban grids and historical population grids. The provincial projection data were validated using population data in 2017 from China’s Provincial Statistical Yearbook, and the accuracy of the population grids in 2015 was evaluated.

"Exploring the environmental, personal and behavioural factors as determinants for university students’ food behaviour","Marquis, M.; Talbot, A.; Sabourin, A.; Riopel, C.","The research objective was to explore the environmental, personal and behavioural factors as determinants of university students’ food behaviour in Québec, Canada. A web-based questionnaire including factors likely to influence eating behaviours was developed. The questionnaire described 16 profiles, each associated with a food choice determinant. The students’ living arrangements and sociodemographic profile were also obtained. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and factor analysis were conducted. A total of 857 students participated in the study. Significant gender differences were noted as well as differences according to living arrangements (e.g., residence hall, apartment with a roommate, with parents or alone in an apartment). Significant relationships were also found between food insecurity and citizenship. Based on the factor analysis and the underlying constructs, four profiles describing different eaters were identified: the planet-nutrition-kitchen lover, the utilitarian lonely eater, the body-driven eater and the mindless eater. The results suggest topics to take into account when developing nutrition interventions or nutrition-based health prevention programmes. These topics include cooking skills, time constraints, commensality, food variety, pleasure, body concern, mindless eating and stress. Moreover, a marginal but worrisome food determinant is also discussed, namely food insecurity. The results suggest some components to strengthen or incorporate into future nutrition interventions, such as body satisfaction, body image and satiety. Strategies to decrease emotional eating and promote mindful eating are worthwhile considerations when developing a health promotion university programme. The heterogeneity of the living arrangements and how they relate to food behaviours are also of great importance. Lastly, it is crucial to provide food assistance programmes and services to students with financial limitations.",2019,01/,International Journal of Consumer Studies,43,1,113-22,,10.1111/ijcs.12490,,#9,Marquis 2019,"",""
Multifeature Quantification of Nuclear Properties from Images of H&E-Stained Biopsy Material for Investigating Changes in Nuclear Structure with Advancing CIN Grade,"Konstandinou, Christos; Glotsos, Dimitris; Kostopoulos, Spiros; Kalatzis, Ioannis; Ravazoula, Panagiota; Michail, George; Lavdas, Eleftherios; Cavouras, Dionisis; Sakellaropoulos, George","Background. Cervical dysplasia is a precancerous condition, and if left untreated, it may lead to cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in nuclear properties of the H&E-stained biopsy material between low CIN and high CIN cases and associate those properties with the CIN grade. Methods. The clinical material comprised hematoxylin and eosin- (H&E-) stained biopsy specimens from lesions of 44 patients diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Four or five nonoverlapping microscopy images were digitized from each patient's H&E specimens, from regions indicated by the expert physician. Sixty-three textural and morphological nuclear features were generated for each patient's images. The Wilcoxon statistical test and the point biserial correlation were used to estimate each feature's discriminatory power between low CIN and high CIN cases and its correlation with the advancing CIN grade, respectively. Results. Statistical analysis showed 19 features that quantify nuclear shape, size, and texture and sustain statistically significant differences between low CIN and high CIN cases. These findings revealed that nuclei in high CIN cases, as compared to nuclei in low CIN cases, have more irregular shape, are larger in size, are coarser in texture, contain higher edges, have higher local contrast, are more inhomogeneous, and comprise structures of different intensities. Conclusion. A systematic statistical analysis of nucleus features, quantified from the H&E-stained biopsy material, showed that there are significant differences in the shape, size, and texture of nuclei between low CIN and high CIN cases. © 2018 Christos Konstandinou et al.",2018,,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2018,,,,10.1155/2018/6358189,,#10,Konstandinou 2018,"",""
Web-Based Creativity Assessment System that Collects Both Verbal and Figural Responses: Its Problems and Potentials,Jiajun Guo,"Creativity tests have been administered in traditional paper and pencil format for more than a half century. With the prevalence of computer/web-based testing and increasing demands for large-scale, faster, and more flexible testing procedures, it is necessary to explore and test the usability of web-based creativity tests. Yet few studies have focused on the use of technologies in the assessment of creativity. The purpose of the present study was to design and test the feasibility of an online creativity assessment system that can collect both verbal and drawing responses. The following two aims were addressed: (1) evaluate reliability evidence of creativity test scores, and (2) compare the online test with its paper version regarding creativity scores. One hundred and sixty-four participants were recruited from a northeast university in the US and randomly assigned into three groups: online-basic (OB), online-advanced (OA), and paper-and-pencil (PP). The findings indicated that no differences were found between different modes (online vs. paper) or different interfaces (simple tools vs. advanced tools) in terms of either creativity scores or reliability evidence.

Advancing sea turtle conservation in the South China Sea via U.S.-China diplomacy,"Yeh, Frederick C.; Lin, Liu; Zhang, Ting; Green, Robin; Martin, Frances; Shi, Haitao","The South China Sea is an important oceanic habitat for endangered sea turtles, which are facing anthropogenic pressures from the illegal wildlife trade, fisheries by-catch, debris pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Compounding these threats are international disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea, exerting a general disinclination toward regional collaborations to solve environmental issues. Since sea turtles are migratory animals that move through aquatic and terrestrial habitats, feeding in waters, and nesting on beaches under the jurisdiction of multiple countries, the species is an ideal ambassador to raise public support for international collaborations. Transnational communications to coordinate conservation efforts across borders provide a positive agenda of cooperation to build trust, creating a politically neutral platform to facilitate opportunities for diplomacy to reset and improve foreign relations, underscoring the value of sea turtles as a flagship species to reduce international tensions and bring nations together. For this reason, the U.S.-China EcoPartnership between Sea Turtles 911 and Hainan Normal University was formed to empower local communities to protect the ocean through sea turtle rescue, public education, and scientific research projects. Genetic research determined the geographic origins of illegally traded sea turtles, validating the uniqueness of the Paracel (Xisha) Islands rookery, and urging policymakers to establish a large-scale sea turtle nature reserve in the South China Sea. To define boundaries of the proposed marine protected area, sea turtles were tracked with satellite telemetry delineating their migratory routes and habitats across multiple countries, underscoring the importance of international collaborations. Debris pollution survey at a major turtle nesting beach in the Paracel Islands demonstrated that pollution is negatively impacting newborn turtle hatchlings and that regional cooperation in the South China Sea should promote the reduction and cleanup of marine debris. Laparoscopic surgery was performed on sea turtles for the first time in China to assess the gender ratio of the local population, which revealed a female biased ratio, indicative of the effects of climate change. A sea turtle rescue center was jointly established in which more than 100 sea turtles were successfully rescued and released by the international and local community, including students who won national awards for their volunteer service. Implementing grassroots initiatives for sea turtle conservation have become an ideal diplomatic channel to strengthen U.S.-China relations as several diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, have engaged in people-to-people exchanges during public educational events. This international partnership serves as a case example in which current political disputes can be set aside to prepare future generations for the existential threat of biodiversity loss and climate change, while increasing peace, stability, and turtles in the region. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers",2021,,Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy,40,5,,,10.1002/ep.13643,,#14,Yeh 2021,"",""

Identification of Potential Valid Clients for a Sustainable Insurance Policy Using an Advanced Mixed Classification Model,You-Shyang Chen; Chien-Ku Lin; Yu-Sheng Lin; Su-Fen Chen; Huei-Hua Tsao,"Due to the social awareness of risk control, we are witnessing the popularization of the insurance concept and the rapid development of financial insurance. The performance of the insurance industry is highly competitive; thus, in order to develop new and old business from existing clients, information on the renewal of client premiums, purchase of new policies, and new client referrals has become an important research topic in this field. However, based on a review of published literature, few scholars have engaged in relevant research on the above topics by data mining, which motivated the formation of this study, hoping to bridge this gap. We constructed 10 mixed classification prediction models (called Models A-J) using advanced data mining techniques. Moreover, 19 conditional attributes (coded as X1-X19) were selected from the collected insurance client database, plus three different decision attributes (coded as X20-X22): whether to pay the renewal insurance premium, whether to buy a new insurance policy, and whether to introduce new clients. In terms of technical methods, we used two data pretreatment techniques, attribute selection and data discretization, combined with different methods of disassembly in proportion and data cross-validation to conduct data analysis of the collected experimental data set. We also combined and calculated 23 important classification algorithms (or classifiers) in seven different classifications of data mining techniques (i.e., decision tree, Bayes, Function, Lazy, Meta, Mise, and Rule). In terms of the experimental results of insurance data, this study has the following important contributions and findings: (1) finding the best classifier; (2) finding the optimal mixed classification model; (3) determining the best disassembly in proportion; (4) comparing the performance of different disassembly in proportion and data cross-validation methods; (5) determining the important factors influencing the decision attribute ""whether to purchase a new insurance policy"", including the time interval to the first purchase, the number of valid policies, the total number of purchased policies, the family salary structure, and gender; and (6) building a knowledge base of decision rules and criteria with the decision tree C4.5 technology, which shall be provided to relevant stakeholders such as insurance dealers and insurance salespeople as a reference for looking for valid clients in the future, and is conducive to the rapid expansion of insurance business.

Comparison of Perceptions of Barriers to Advancement for Women in Radiation Oncology between Men and Women Physicians,"Tam, A.; Thomas, R.; Kaul, A.; Barry, P.N.; Li, Y.R.","Purpose/Objective(s)While women now comprise the majority of medical school matriculants, there continues to be a disparity in representation of women in leadership roles and an attrition in the promotion pipeline in medicine. Prior studies have shown that women physicians face unique barriers to advancement in radiation oncology. Thus, understanding how perceptions of these barriers among men and women differ may shed light on why the ""leaky leadership pipeline"" exists.Materials/MethodsAn anonymous survey was disseminated to the American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO) members via email and social media between February and May 2023. In addition to demographics (age, gender, race, practice setting), respondents were asked to respond to statements about their perceptions of the gender barriers in the following domains: (a) equal access, (b) work-life balance, (c) gender bias, and (d) leadership support using a validated 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analyses with chi-square were performed using STATA.ResultsA total of 1107 respondents completed the survey. A majority of (77.1%) identified as female with 22.0% as male (the rest as either non-binary, transgendered, or decline to answer). More than half (53.8%) of participants were aged 30-39, with 76.0% identifying as (non-Hispanic) White. Only a minority (28.1%) of participants are employed at academic medical centers. Overall, we found that men and female radiation oncologists held similar perceptions, with no significant differences in rating between the two groups for 34 of the 45 statements (75.6%; p>0.05). The domains on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" had the most varied ratings, with significant differences in rating for five (41.7%) of 12 statements and five (26.3%) of 19 statements in the respective domain. For example, from the ""leadership support"" domain, 62.1% of women agreed that their chairs tried to ensure that women physicians were not subject to gender-based biases, compared to 52.9% of men (p = 0.01), and 61.1% of women agreed that their chairs were supportive when women physicians talked about work-family issues, compared to 56.1% of men (p = 0.02). Whereas statements from the ""equal access"" domain, 59.7% of women agreed that women physicians had equal access to career development opportunities (compared to 51.6% of men; p = 0.01) and 61.0% of women agreed that women physicians received equitable salaries (compared to 53.3% of men; p = 0.02).ConclusionIn this survey of radiation oncologists, we found that women and men shared similar perceptions of barriers to advancement for women physicians. However, there were some varied perspectives on ""leadership support"" and ""equal access"" and, unexpectedly, more men expressed concerns about gender equality within these domains than women physicians.

Librarian faculty status: Exploring inequality regimes in a comparative case study,"Wiser, J.","Faculty status for librarians is one of the most debated topics within academic librarianship (Bailey & Becher, 2022). Professional associations argue that faculty status benefits librarians, but little empirical work has explored how faculty status plays out in real-world settings (Galbraith, Garrison, & Hales, 2016). This study investigates whether faculty status helps librarians overcome barriers using a comparative case study of two academic libraries representing polarity on this issue. One library offers librarians tenure-track faculty appointments; the other classifies librarians as staff. Through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, the study explores administrative obstacles faced by librarians and whether faculty status ameliorates them. This study also examines if debates over librarian faculty status ignore inequality regimes (Acker, 2006) that may appear in both faculty and staff settings. Surprisingly, findings reveal faculty status is associated with more workplace hierarchies and stress, especially for female librarians. Contrary to claims made by faculty status proponents, most librarians feel equally undervalued by disciplinary faculty regardless of status. Ultimately, blanket recommendations for faculty status seem ineffective, and nuanced solutions tailored to local contexts better serve librarians. This study encourages an honest dialogue to empower librarians based on individual needs, not rigid assumptions.

Modelling STEM learners' academic performance in advanced level secondary schools with smart classrooms in Rwanda,"Ngendahayo, E.; Habarurema, J.B.; Limone, P.; Zhang, W.","Smart classroom setting is an effective technology-enhanced pedagogy when an instructor capitalises on the key drivers underlying its success. The objectives of the study are twofold. First, to investigate the factors that impact learners' academic performance in the smart classroom setting. Second, to determine whether learners' performance varies based on their gender and prior experience in the smart classroom. Three schools were selected and sampled from a pool of public advanced level (A' Level) STEM secondary schools with smart classrooms in Rwanda because they were among the first to set up smart classrooms. Data were randomly obtained from 389 learners, majoring in six different combinations. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess the validity and reliability of the measurement scale. A valid and thought-provoking learners' academic performance model, to enhance their learning outcomes, is presented. The model was validated using Structural equation modelling (SEM). The results indicated that technology self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and learning satisfaction were all predictors of learners' performance. Learners' perceived ease of use and satisfaction were direct predictors of their performance. Besides, learners' perceived ease of use and usefulness were directly affected by technology self-efficacy. On the other hand, technology self-efficacy indirectly impacts learners' performance. The invariance analysis across gender groups revealed that male learners perceive smart classroom technology to be easier to use than females.

Sustainable Gender Equality: A Comparative Perspective on STEM Education and Employment in Jordan,"Sharif, A.A.; Lee, A.; Alshdiefat, A.S.; Rana, M.Q.; Abu Ghunmi, N.-A.","Gender equality is a concept that is synonymous with debates towards economic and societal advancement, as manifested through the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 5. This study sets out to identify the key indicators driving gender equality in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and employment in Jordan. This area is both critical and timely in light of emerging challenges facing technological advancement, progressive economies, and wider societal inclusion strategies within the professional environment. This study predominantly employs a quantitative methodology, utilising a survey to evaluate and rank a comprehensive set of indicators/challenges associated with gender equality in the published literature. Feedback is gathered from both male and female participants. The findings of this study reveal certain categories and indicators that are highly ranked compared with others, with practical aspects such as workplace conditions and professional treatment, societal norms and gender stereotypes, and professional perceptions and underlying gender bias being more predominant in Jordan. This study also revealed differing challenges facing gender equality in employment compared with the ones faced in education.

A schema for characterizing the multiple-choice questions was proposed and used to analyze the entire question set. Male bias questions showed moderate to large bias and tended to include characteristics related to visualization, though not images. Several questions exhibited a moderate bias in favor of females and were characterized by requiring a numerical calculation involving a simple one-step equation.

Evaluation of the level of problem solving skills of Turkish higher education graduates in technology-rich environments,"Acikgoz, O.; Aslan, A.; Gunay, A.","This study aims to evaluate the level of Turkish higher education graduates' problem-solving skills (PSSs) in technology-rich environments (TREs) at work and daily life as information and communication technologies are increasingly used in economic and social structure. It also investigates the effects of socio-demographic factors including gender, age, the field of study, and higher education attainment level on their PSSs in TREs. In this context, the data concerning Turkish higher education graduates' PSSs released by the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) in 2016 was used. With regard to methodology, we employed descriptive and logistic regression analyses to investigate the data. The descriptive statistics results indicated that the participants use computer at a basic level in TREs and work in small and medium enterprises where technology is not highly demanded at moderate and advanced levels. The logistic regression analysis results revealed that gender and higher education level have significant impacts on their level of PSSs in TREs as opposed to age and the field of study variables. The significant differences are in favor of the female participants and associate and bachelor degree levels. These findings accounted for nearly 4% of their level of problem solving skills. Based on the study findings and the changing expectations of labor market, the policy proposals were discussed to increase the level of Turkish higher education students' PSSs in TREs.

Women are under-represented in soil science leadership positions. Women receive SSSA awards at lower rates than their participation in the society. Women face attrition more than men as they advance the soil science career ladder. Diversity and inclusion are important pathways to grow and innovate soil science. The soil science discipline has undergone significant changes since its establishment in the 1900s; from strong connections with agronomy to a broader focus on ecosystems, earth, and environmental sciences while also during this period experiencing a notable increase in diversity among soil scientists. In this review, we explore soil science from the perspective of gender demographics and disciplinary foci of soil scientists. We examine graduate student enrollment metrics; employment information in academia, the federal government, and the private sector; and membership data from SSSA to gain deeper insight into these changes and the implications for the future of soil science. Women earn nearly half of the advanced soil science degrees. The number of women pursuing soil science careers has also increased, albeit less markedly, as women now comprise 24, 26, and 20% of the soil scientists in academic faculty positions, federal agencies, and private industry, respectively. However, there is reason for concern that women linger in intermediate levels of employment, and further attrition occurs along the career ladder with only ∼18% of the highest employment levels held by women; even fewer reach executive leadership levels in any sector. The growing participation of women in soil science is further reflected in a nearly 45% increase in female membership and meeting attendance in SSSA over the past decade, but recognition of their accomplishments and their presence in SSSA leadership positions remains low. We provide recommendations toward greater inclusion and gender diversity as this represents an important pathway to grow and innovate our science. © 2019 The Authors.",2019,,Soil Science Society of America Journal,83,5,1278-1289,,10.2136/sssaj2019.03.0085,,#27,Vaughan 2019,"",""

Although APCSP has drawn a more diverse population of course takers than the traditional Advanced Placement Computer Science A (APCSA) course, questions remain about whether the new course portends students' longer-term interest in computing and technology. This study used data from more than 120,000 first-year college students in the United States to understand the relationship between taking APCSA, APCSP, or both APCS courses and students' aspirations to major in computing or to pursue a computing or technology career. Our results indicated that taking APCSA or taking both APCS courses positively predicted students' major or career aspirations in computing and technology, but that taking only APCSP did not predict long-term computing interest (although positive associations were identified for women). The findings identify a possible tension in the function of APCSP, as it appears to broaden access to computing knowledge, but may not necessarily encourage longer-term computing aspirations for all groups of underrepresented students.",2022,06/30,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,22,2,18 (26 pp.),,10.1145/3479431,,#28,Sax 2022,"",""
Advancing Women in Chemistry: A Step Toward Gender Parity,"Tripathi, Neetu; Goshisht, Manoj Kumar","As chemistry progressed over the years, modern society witnessed the significant contribution of women chemists. However, the persisting gender imbalance in the scientific community, attributed to improper societal norms and several other reasons, is a matter of concern. The manuscript highlights some great women chemists, such as Nobel Prize awardees, who have created history through their outstanding research work and are role models for other women. Since women continue to encounter recurring obstacles to moving forward in their area, the ""leaky pipeline""of women in chemical science remains problematic. Numerous factors, including having to shoulder the labor of childcare and household work and a lack of awareness of regulations and possibilities, contribute to prejudices and the gender gap in higher-level administrative and decision-making roles. To close the gender gap and empower women chemists, we highlight some initiatives (awards, fellowships, schemes, and grants) that have been put forth by governments, organizations, foundations, companies, industries, and publishing societies. As per statistics, only 4% of female scientists have been awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry until now. Only 35%, 22%, 14%, 26%, and 5% of women are serving as editors-in-chief, while 38%, 40%, 18%, 22%, and 21% are working as associate editors of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), Wiley, Elsevier, and Springer journals, respectively. A further issue is that women receive far fewer honors in chemistry. To promote a more encouraging atmosphere for women scientists at all career phases, we listed some recommendations that research grant funders, academic institutions, publishers, and scientific organizations can follow.

Examining the relationship between AP STEM course-taking and college major selection: Gender and racial differences,"Jewett, Elizabeth C.; Chen, Rong","Background: To meet the growing demand for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and remain competitive in the fields of science and technology over the next decade, the United States is expected to need more than 1 million additional STEM professionals. This would require an annual increase of 34% in undergraduate STEM degrees over the next decade to meet the projected need. Purpose: This study examined the relationship between Advanced Placement (AP) STEM course-taking in high school and selection of college STEM majors and whether the relationship differs by gender and race/ethnicity. Design/Method: For controlling student and school factors, a binary logistic regression model with the clustered standard error was utilized to determine the relationship between AP STEM course-taking and STEM major selection. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to further understand how AP STEM course-taking was associated with engineering major selection. The analysis included a series of interaction effects tests, examining the variation of gender and racial/ethnic differences in STEM and, more specifically, engineering major selection as a function of AP STEM course-taking. Results: Findings indicate gender and AP STEM course exposure are significant in predicting STEM major selection. Interaction effects test results further show that the relationship between AP STEM course-taking and STEM major selection varies significantly by gender. A similar pattern is found in the relationship between AP STEM course-taking and engineering major selection. Conclusion: This study provides much-needed empirical evidence to understand the relationships between AP STEM courses course-taking in high school and the selection of college STEM majors and how such relationships vary by race/ethnicity and gender. Additional research is encouraged to inform future educators and policymakers in promoting equity for students in pursuing paths to STEM and, more specifically, engineering-related careers. © 2022 American Society for Engineering Education.",2022,,Journal of Engineering Education,111,3,512-530,,10.1002/jee.20464,,#31,Jewett 2022,"",""

"Does research performance explain the ""leaky pipeline"" in Indian academia? A study of agricultural and applied economics","Bansal, S.; Viswanathan, B.; Meenakshi, J.V.","This article documents the existence of a leaky pipeline based on complete enumeration of faculty in two large public academic networks: state agricultural universities and institutions of the Indian Council of Social Science Research. We then examine if there are gender differences in the quantity and quality of research publications of women relative to men that can explain this. As proxies for quality and visibility, we use several metrics, including the number of citations, h-index, i10 index, and Scimago rank of the journal in which the research is featured. A novel aspect of the analysis is the comparison of time paths of cumulative publications over career paths of men and women professors. Our analysis of research performance is based on scraping publicly-available data sources, including faculty and institutional websites, and google scholar pages, and represents one-third (and likely positively selected) of all faculty in these institutions. Our results suggest that women are disadvantaged in terms of number of publications during early career years, however, the disadvantage is mitigated with seniority and women perform equally well or even surpass men later in their careers. Women are more likely to write single-authored articles and have fewer collaborators than men, indicating that they do not access collaborative spaces as much, and are less networked than men. In spite of this, there is suggestive evidence that women are more quality conscious than men. This nuanced look at research productivity suggests the source of the leaky pipeline does not arise from differences in performance. © 2023 International Association of Agricultural Economists.",2023,/,Agricultural Economics,,,274-88,,10.1111/agec.12744,,#33,Bansal 2023,"",""

In this paper students’ opinion on some aspects of inclusion of webinar in higher education is studied and these opinions are statistically analysed. Perception of the students under study is assembled through questionnaire. Results illustrate that though students are well versed with the use of technology, there is a lack of awareness regarding webinars. Logistic regression exhibits how the factors like age, gender, location, stream of education, access of laptop, access of mobile, access of YouTube, experience of webinar, educational infrastructure affect in the opinion of the students to incorporate webinar in higher education in recent future.

The study provides insight into the socio-demographic, work-related, and everyday factors that are associated with a strong and a weak problem-solving performance. The results indicate that HE adults stand out from adults with other educational backgrounds. Having a higher education degree is related with strong problem-solving skills. Still, it is rather surprising that only 15% of HE adults are strong problem-solvers and that as many as 35% can be considered weak problem-solvers.

We found that a measurement invariance fully holds in a multi-group SEM by gender, so it was possible to carry out analysis with gender mediated by introductory physics and high school GPA. Moreover, we find that these introductory physics courses that have gender differences do not predict performance in advanced physics courses. In other words, students could be using invalid data about their introductory physics performance to make their decision about whether physics is the right field for them to pursue, and those invalid data in introductory physics favor male students. Also, introductory mathematics courses predict performance in advanced mathematics courses which in turn predict performance in advanced physics courses. Furthermore, apart from the introductory physics courses that do not predict performance in future physics courses, there is a strong predictive relationship between the sophomore, junior and senior level physics courses.",2020,11/,European Journal of Physics,41,6,065701 (19 pp.),,10.1088/1361-6404/ab9f1d,,#43,Whitcomb 2020,"",""
Hispanic female stem faculty in Puerto Rico: results from an NSF advance networking workshop,"Carter-Johnson, F.D.; Byars-Winston, A.; Tull, R.G.; Zayas, B.; Padin, C.","Hispanic female faculty, especially those in Puerto Rico, remain understudied in the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE's efforts. To address this need, a strategic, inter-institutional collaboration funded by an ADVANCE grant was initiated to investigate the challenges and opportunities for Hispanic female STEM faculty in Puerto Rico that may influence their professional and career advancement. This paper reports the initial results of a programmatic workshop intervention delivered to 50 participants drawn from 15 of Puerto Rico's leading public and private universities. Based on the New Exploration for Transforming Work, Opportunities, Research and Knowledge (NETWORKing) model, a multi-modal workshop was designed and implemented that included interactive panel presentations, group discussions, poster sessions, and reports from national and international activities discussing Hispanic female faculty in STEM. Data from a faculty climate survey were collected that assessed participants’ perceptions of their university and department climate, resources, supports and barriers. A key finding was the presence of aspiration-experience gaps between the types of research, teaching and service opportunities required for advancement in academe and the experiences of the majority of the female faculty in the sample.

The many facets of academic mobility and its impact on scholars' career,"Momeni, F.; Karimi, F.; Mayr, P.; Peters, I.; Dietze, S.","International mobility in academia can enhance the human and social capital of researchers and consequently their scientific outcome. However, there is still a very limited understanding of the different mobility patterns among scholars with various socio-demographic characteristics. By studying these differences, we can detect inequalities in access to scholarly networks across borders, which can cause disparities in scientific advancement. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we investigate to what extent individuals' factors (e.g., country, career stage, and field of research) associate with the mobility of male and female researchers. Second, we explore the relationship between mobility and scientific activity and impact. For this purpose, we used a bibliometric approach to track the mobility of authors. To compare the researchers' scientific outcomes, we considered the number of publications and received citations as indicators, as well as the number of unique co-authors in all their publications. We also analyzed the co-authorship network of researchers and compared centrality measures of ""mobile"" and ""non-mobile"" researchers. Results show that researchers from North America and Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly female ones, have the lowest, respectively, highest tendency towards international mobility. Having international co-authors increases the probability of international movement. Our findings uncover gender inequality in international mobility across scientific fields and countries. Across genders, researchers in the Physical sciences have the most and in the Social sciences the least rate of mobility. We observed more mobility for Social scientists at the advanced career stage, while researchers in other fields prefer to move at earlier career stages. Also, we found a positive correlation between mobility and scientific outcomes, but no apparent difference between females and males. Indeed, researchers who have started mobility at the advanced career stages had a better scientific outcome. Comparing the centrality of mobile and non-mobile researchers in the co-authorship networks reveals a higher social capital advantage for mobile researchers.

As artificial intelligence (AI)-based teledermatology services hold promise in redefining the melanoma screening paradigm, a study that evaluates user satisfaction with a smartphone-compatible, AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator is lacking. Methods: Data was collected between April and May 2019 in Taiwan. To assess user satisfaction with MoleMe, an AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator on a smartphone, users were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate four aspects, including interaction, impact on daily life, usability, and overall performance, after completing a MoleMe evaluation session. For each question, users could rank their satisfaction level from 1 to 5, with five showing strongly satisfied and one showing strongly unsatisfied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare user satisfaction among different age groups, genders, and risk predictions received. Result: A total of 1231 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Over 90% of the participants were satisfied (score = 4 or 5) and over 75% of the participants were strongly satisfied (score 5) with MoleMe, in terms of usability, interaction, and impact on daily life.

Overall, American faculty exhibits high geographic mobility from their graduating institutions in terms of relocation distance and cross-MSA moves. History faculty members have the highest mobility while those in business show the lowest mobility.

A novel machine learning approach for evaluation of public policies: an application in relation to the performance of university researchers,"Ballestar, M.T.; Doncel, L.M.; Sainz, J.; Ortigosa-Blanch, A.","Research has become the main reference point for academic life in modern universities. Research incentives have been a controversial issue, because of the difficulty of identifying who are the main beneficiaries and what are the long-term effects. Still, new policies including financial incentives have been adopted to increase the research output at all possible levels. Little literature has been devoted to the response to those incentives. To bridge this gap, we carry out our analysis with data of a six years program developed in Madrid (Spain). Instead of using a traditional econometric approach, we design a machine learning multilevel model to discover on whom, when, and for how long those policies have an effect. The empirical model consists of an automated nested longitudinal clustering (ANLC) performed in two stages. Firstly, it performs a stratification of academics, and secondly, it performs a longitudinal segmentation for each group. The second part considers the researchers’ sociodemographic, academic information and the evolution of their performance over time in the form of the annual percentage variation of their marks over the period. The new methodology, whose robustness is tested with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm, shows that tenure track researchers present a better response to incentives than tenured researches, and also that gender plays an important role in academia.

It has been also attempted to determine which features can properly show the physiological differences of two groups during sad stimuli. For this purpose, time-, frequency-, wavelet-, and nonlinear- based approaches were examined. Applying the Wilcoxon rank sum test, significant differences between the groups were inspected. The analysis was performed on 47 college students. The effect of data length on the results was also investigated. The best results were achieved using the data length of 10 s with an overlap of 50%.

Using Team-Based Learning to Promote Engineering Students' Performance and Self-Efficacy in a Technical Writing Class,"Shenghua Zha; Shenghua Wu; Estis, J.M.","Introduction: Technical writing is an essential skill set for engineering students. Many studies have been conducted, but very few have used experimental or quasiexperimental design to identify an optimal instructional method in a technical writing class. Situating the case: Team-based learning (TBL) is a well-structured learning method that prior studies have found to enhance students' academic performance. TBL includes individual and collaborative learning activities from lower to higher cognitive levels. Peer leadership, as evidenced in other studies, uses appointed student leaders to promote equal and active group participation and shows a potential to solve the gender issue found in engineering class collaborations. About the case: In this case, we infused peer leadership in TBL in three technical writing sessions of an engineering lab class. Appointed student leaders were responsible for initiating and sustaining discussions, asking each group member's input, and seeking collective decisions on solutions. The other class used traditional TBL activities. Methods/approach: Nonparametric analyses were conducted to compare students' technical writing skills and self-efficacy, as well as gender differences in two classes. Results/discussion: Students in the peer-led TBL class showed better technical writing skill retention than their counterparts in the traditional TBL class. The gender difference was identified in the traditional TBL class.

A demographic analysis on prerequisite preparation in an advanced data structures course,"Krause-Levy, S.; Valstar, S.; Porter, L.; Griswold, W.G.","Previous work in computing has shown that Black, Latinx, Native American and Pacific islander (BLNPI), women, first-generation, and transfer students tend to have worse outcomes during their time in university compared to their majority counterparts. Previous work has also found that students' incoming prerequisite course proficiency is positively correlated with their outcomes in a course. In this work, we investigate the role that prerequisite course proficiency has on outcomes between these groups of students. Specifically, we examine incoming prerequisite course proficiency in an Advanced Data Structures course. When comparing incoming prerequisite course proficiency between demographic pairs, we only see small differences for gender or by first-generation status. There is a sizeable difference by BLNPI status, although this difference is not statistically significant, possibly due to the small number of BLNPI students. In addition, we find that transfer students have sizeable and statistically significantly lower prerequisite course proficiency when compared to non-transfer students. For BLNPI and transfer students, we find that they also have lower grades in the prerequisite courses, which may partially explain their lower prerequisite course proficiency.

Assessing skills gap in high value manufacturing: An oil and gas industry continuing education case study,"Kumar, Vasu; Nepal, Bimal; Johnson, Michael D.","Prior research reveals that there is a gap in the skill set of new hires (especially in fresh college graduates) with respect to what is needed to perform advanced manufacturing jobs in industry. Several methods are being employed by both industry and academia to narrow the gap. Academic institutions are designing industry oriented and project-based curricula while industry is partnering with community colleges and universities in supporting capstone projects and developing short courses to meet their needs. This paper investigates the skills gap in high value manufacturing, especially in the energy industry. The research utilizes an energy industry focused continuing education case delivered to 53 participants as a tool to understand the current skill level of the participants and their self-beliefs about the preparedness of the new hires, particularly those who join fresh from higher education. A structured survey methodology is used to assess the program outcomes and investigate the skills gap in the current workforce. The paper also investigates if there are any significant differences in the perceived skills gaps in the current workforce and new hires based on gender, ethnicity, and education of the participants. The case study findings show that current and newly hired industry workforce lacked the needed skills in some key areas of high value manufacturing. The perception of the skills gap in new hires varies by age, gender, and education level of the participants. On the other hand, the case study analysis does not find any statistically significant difference in the skills of current workforce based on the participants' demographic data or the type of industry they work for. The study also finds a significant difference in perceived preparedness level between the type of HVM topics among all groups (participants themselves and current workforce and new hires in their industry). © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.",2021,,International Journal of Engineering Education,37,3,721-732,,,,#74,Kumar 2021,"",""
An Experimental and Algorithm Research on the Influence of OTO Teaching Mode on College Students' PE Learning Interest Based on Cloud Computing,"Wu, S.; Dai, J.; Yang, J.","Algorithm is a step of problem-solving, and algorithm can be defined as any special method for solving a certain type of problem. In computer science, algorithms are described in computer algorithm language and represent accurate and effective methods for solving a class of problems with computers. In order to verify the role of the OTO teaching mode from the perspective of cultivating learning interest and to provide a practical basis for the reform of physical education in colleges and universities, 107 second-year physical education majors in a common university were selected as experimental subjects and divided into an experimental group and a control group, and the two groups were intervened through a 16-week experiment. Multivariate covariance was used to analyze the influence of two teaching modes on college students' interest in sports learning. After excluding factors such as student gender, physical exercise behavior stage, football learning experience, and physical health, the groups have statistical significance in the four dimensions of positivity, skill learning, extracurricular activities, and negativity in sports learning interest. However, there is no significant difference in the influence of sports attention on sports learning interest. The research proves that the application of OTO teaching mode is conducive to promoting students' learning positivity, technical learning, and extracurricular activities and alleviating students' negative learning emotions. The degree of attention to sports in the interest of sports learning is not very significant. It is suggested that colleges and universities adopt the OTO teaching mode in the teaching of general football courses.",2021,/,Scientific Programming,,,2042158 (6 pp.),,10.1155/2021/2042158,,#75,Wu 2021,"",""

Conditions for spin-off creation at Swiss universities of applied sciences - a gender sensitive approach,"Schneider, N.; Blaese, R.; Liebig, B.","Purpose The promotion of research-based entrepreneurship is considered a crucial task for universities and policymakers in many Western countries. Research has shown that the university environment plays a decisive role in the spin-off activities of researchers. Although the number of science-based spin-offs has increased in recent years, women are still an exception when it comes to developing spin-off ventures. In turn, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the university environment that supports entrepreneurship from a gender perspective. Design/methodology/approach Based on the theoretical framework of the ""Entrepreneurial University,"" this contribution examines the formal and informal conditions for academic entrepreneurship using the example of Swiss universities of applied sciences (UAS). Based on a cross-sectional dataset of 1,551 researchers from various disciplines who were surveyed in 2019, linear regressions and logistic regression models were used to test gender-specific differences in the perception of organizational conditions concerning the entrepreneurial exploitation of research. Findings The results demonstrated significant differences in the perception of formal and informal conditions in higher education. First, they show gender differences in the perception of informal entrepreneurial support in universities; in particular, female researchers received less informal support for spin-off projects. For example, women hardly viewed commercial use of research and development knowledge as a career option and considered the existence of entrepreneurial role models at universities to be low. Second, further analyses highlighted that also formal support offerings were less known among female researchers. Originality/value The study highlights organizational barriers for female researchers regarding the development of spin-off creation at UAS, including the different formal and informal conditions for female academics in comparison to their male counterparts.",2021,/,International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship,13,4,373-93,,10.1108/IJGE-07-2020-0099,,#77,Schneider 2021,"",""

Construction and analysis of students' physical health portrait based on principal component analysis improved Canopy-<i>K</i>-means algorithm,"Ji, R.; Yang, J.; Wu, Y.; Li, Y.; Li, R.; Chen, J.","With the advancement of society and the improvement of living standards, the significance of students' physical health has become increasingly prominent. However, currently, the assessment and analysis of students' physical health heavily depend on conventional statistical methods. Even with the application of data mining-related methodologies for analysis and evaluation, the exploitation and utilization of physical health big data remain relatively restricted. In this paper, an improved Canopy-K-means algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used to construct and analyze a portrait of students' physical fitness and health. The method combines data dimensionality reduction techniques and cluster analysis techniques, and its combined performance is the best compared to other algorithms in the ablation experiments for both male and female student data groups.

The interdisciplinarity dilemma: Public versus private interests,"Fontana, Magda; Iori, Martina; Leone Sciabolazza, Valerio; Souza, Daniel","Researchers often receive contrasting incentives when conducting their work. On the one hand, an interdisciplinary approach is required to produce scientific advances and access to funding. On the other, academic scholarships and evaluation mechanisms are still organized following the criteria of traditional disciplinary fields. If pursuing interdisciplinary research results in contrasting outcomes, science may face an interdisciplinarity dilemma: should researchers pursue their own private interest to build a reputation? Or should they endeavor towards public interest? How costly in terms of reputation is to choose interdisciplinarity research (IDR) over (more) specialized research? We answer these questions by exploiting data on 23,926 articles published by 6,105 researchers affiliated with the University of Florida in the period 2008–2013. Through individual fixed-effect, we compare articles of the same scholar to roll out the influence of individual characteristics on the scientific impact of their research. We find that the diverse dimensions of IDR (Variety, Balance, and Disparity) have a different effect on the reputation of a scholar and on her contribution to societal research. We confirm the existence of trade-off between private and public interest. We also point out that the increase of IDR aiming at connecting distant disciplines reduces the usefulness of the resulting knowledge. Results are robust to various specifications and apply to all scholars, regardless of their gender, collaboration behavior, discipline, and performance.

The problem arise is the supply of suitable bone is limited with many complications. Tissue-engineered hydroxyapatite bone (TEHB) scaffold impregnated with osteoprogenitor cells developed as an alternative to promote bone regeneration. METHODS:: This animal protocol has been approved by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Animal Ethical Committee. The TEHB scaffold prepared from hydroxyapatite using gel casting method. A total of six adolescent female sheep were chosen for this study. Later, all the sheep were euthanized in a proper manner and the bone harvested for biomechanical study. Bone marrow was collected from iliac crest of the sheep and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) isolated and cultured. BMSCs then cultured in osteogenic medium for osteoprogenitor cells development and the plasma collected was seeded with osteoprogenitor cells mixed with calcium chloride. Bone defect of 3 cm length of tibia bone created from each sheep leg and implanted with autologous and TEHB scaffold in 2 different groups of sheep. Wound site was monitored weekly until the wound completely healed and conventional X-ray performed at week 1 and 24. Shear test was conducted to determine the shear force on the autologous bone and TEHB scaffold after implantation for 24 weeks. RESULTS:: All of the sheep survived without any complications during the study period and radiograph showed new bone formation. Later, the bone harvested was for biomechanical study. The highest shear force for the autologous group was 13 MPa and the lowest was 5 MPa while for the scaffold group, the highest was 10 MPa and the lowest was 3 MPa. Although, proximal and distal interface of autologous bone graft shows higher shear strength compared to the TEHB scaffold but there is no significant difference in both groups, p value > 0.05. Histologically in both proximal and distal interface in both arms shows bone healing and woven bone formation.

Impact of additive manufacturing on engineering education - Evidence from Italy,"Minetola, Paolo; Iuliano, Luca; Bassoli, Elena; Gatto, Andrea","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how the direct access to additive manufacturing (AM) systems impacts on education of future mechanical engineers, within a Master's program at a top Italian University. Design/methodology/approach - A survey is specifically designed to assess the relevance of entry-level AM within the learning environment, as a tool for project development. The survey is distributed anonymously to three consecutive cohorts of students who attended the course of ""computer-aided production (CAP)"", within the Master of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. The course includes a practical project, consisting in the design of a polymeric product with multiple components and ending with the production of an assembled prototype. The working assembly is fabricated by the students themselves, who operate a fused deposition modelling (FDM) machine, finish the parts and evaluate assemblability and functionality. The post-course survey covers diverse aspects of the learning process, such as: motivation, knowledge acquisition, new abilities and team-working skills. Responses are analyzed to evaluate students' perception of the usefulness of additive technologies in learning product design and development. Among the projects, one representative case study is selected and discussed. Findings - Results of the research affirm a positive relationship of access to AM devices to perceived interest, motivation and ease of learning of mechanical engineering. Entry-level additive technologies offer a hands-on experience within academia, fostering the acquisition of technical knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The survey is distributed to more than 200 students to cover the full population of the CAP course over three academic years. The year the students participated in the CAP course is not tracked because the instructor was the same and there were no administrative differences. For this reason, the survey administration might be a limitation of the current study. In addition to this, no gender distinction is made because historically, the percentage of female students in Mechanical Engineering courses is about 10 per cent or lower. Although the answers to the survey are anonymous, only 37 per cent of the students gave a feedback. Thus, on the one hand, impact assessment is limited to a sample of about one-third of the complete population, but, on the other hand, the anonymity ensures randomization in the sample selection. Practical implications - Early exposure of forthcoming designers to AM tools can turn into a ""think-additive"" approach to product design, that is a groundbreaking conception of geometries and product functionalities, leading to the full exploitation of the possibilities offered by additive technologies. Social implications - Shared knowledge can act as a springboard for mass adoption of AM processes. Originality/value - The advantages of adopting AM technologies at different levels of education, for diverse educational purposes and disciplines, are well assessed in the literature. The innovative aspect of this paper is that the impact of AM is evaluated through a feedback coming directly from mechanical engineering students. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2015,,Rapid Prototyping Journal,21,5,535-555,,10.1108/RPJ-09-2014-0123,,#84,Minetola 2015,"",""

"Impact of Provider Prior Use of HIE on System Complexity, Performance, Patient Care, Quality and System Concerns","Feldman, S.S.; Hikmet, N.; Modi, S.; Schooley, B.","To date, most HIE studies have investigated user perceptions of value prior to use. Few studies have assessed factors associated with the value of HIE through its actual use. This study investigates provider perceptions on HIE comparing those who had prior experience vs those who had no experience with it. In so doing, we identify six constructs: prior use, system complexity, system concerns, public/population health, care delivery, and provider performance. This study uses a mixed methods approach to data collection. From 15 interviews of medical community leaders, a survey was constructed and administered to 263 clinicians. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance was used, along with Tukey HSD tests for multiple comparisons. Results indicated providers whom previously used HIE had more positive perceptions about its benefits in terms of system complexity (p = .001), care delivery (p = .000), population health (p = .003), and provider performance (p = .005); women providers were more positive in terms of system concerns (p = .000); patient care (p = .031), and population health (p = .009); providers age 44-55 were more positive than older and younger groups in terms of patient care (p = .032), population health (p = .021), and provider performance (p = .014); while differences also existed across professional license groups (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)) for all five constructs (p p = .017), population health (p = .018), and provider performance (p = .018). There were no statistically significant differences found between groups based on a provider's role in an organization (patient care, administration, teaching/research, other).

In this study, we analyzed the discordance between p16 IHC and HPV status in patients treated with definitive (chemo)radiation (CRT) for OPSCC and any potential association with treatment outcome. Materials/Methods Retrospective study was performed with IRB approval. Patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) or CRT for OPSCC at Duke University Medical Center between January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2021. Patients with positive p16 IHC but without HPV subtype were noted for further DNA PCR testing. Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years of age with available treatment records and completion of treatment. Exclusion criteria: previously treated head and neck cancer primary, metastatic or recurrent disease, or treatment at an outside facility. Associations between HPV and p16 IHC status, patient demographics (age, race, sex, tobacco use history), tumor stage (AJCC 8th edition), treatment modality, recurrence patterns and overall survival were extracted from the medical record. Time to event outcomes (OS, DFS, and LRC) were calculated from the date of diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test. Categorical data was summarized with count (frequency) and compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Results 62 patients were analyzed who had p16 IHC and confirmed HPV status by PCR. 51 patients (82%) were HPV+/p16+. There was no difference in AJCC 8th edition group stage. There was also no difference between smoking status or pack years between the two groups. OS, DFS, and LRC at 3 years for all patients were 87% (95% CI: 79.0% - 95.8%), 77.2% (95% CI: 67.4% - 88.5%), and 88.5% (95% CI: 80.8% - 96.9%), respectively.

Hidden environmental costs of economic ambitions: An empirical study of pollution emissions in the wake of growth targets,"Guo, L.; Yang, M.; Su, M.; Li, H.","The extant body of academic literature has thoroughly examined the influence of political promotion institutions on various aspects of economic growth and corporate behavior. However, there remains a gap in the understanding the extent and mechanisms through which the establishment of economic growth targets influences firms' pollution emissions. Addressing this gap, we construct datasets that encapsulate both micro-level and macro-level perspectives to examine the impact of economic growth targets on corporate pollution. We find that an increase in economic growth targets leads to a significant rise in pollution emissions from industrial firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we employ various strategies, and our results remain robust across these different approaches. We then estimate the heterogeneous impact of economic growth targets and demonstrate that the positive effect of these targets on pollution emissions tends to be less pronounced for firms situated in cities governed by female mayors. Conversely, the effect appears more pronounced for firms located in the western region, those operating in cities led by older mayors, and those in cities where mayors have lower levels of education. Finally, we explore potential mechanisms through which economic growth targets impact corporate pollution. Our results show that at the firm level, a higher economic growth target primarily leads to increased pollution emissions from enterprises by reducing firms' investment in pollution control. At the city level, an elevation in economic growth targets predominantly results in escalated enterprise-related pollution, chiefly due to its hindrance of urban green innovation, reduction in fiscal allocations for science and technology, and a decrease in educational fiscal outlays. These empirical findings strongly advocate for the implementation of measures aimed at dissuading prefecture-level city governments from formulating excessively ambitious economic growth targets, as a viable strategy for mitigating pollution stemming from manufacturing firms in developing nations. In view of this, our research is conducive to advancing the process of building a sustainable development path in China and providing reliable solutions to global ecological challenges.

We examine the costs of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) compared with conventional whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) in the United States and investigate the influences of patient characteristics and commercial insurance on HF-WBI use. Methods and Materials: In a retrospective study using private employer-sponsored insurance claims, a pooled cross-sectional evaluation of radiation therapy in patients with commercial insurance was performed from 2008 to 2017. The study population included female patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation. Results: A total of 15,869 women received HF-WBI, and 59,328 received CF-WBI. HF-WBI use increased from 2008 to 2017. Community-level factors such as a higher proportion of college graduates and greater mixed racial composition were associated with increased HF-WBI use. Mean insurer-paid radiation therapy expenditures were significantly lower for HF-WBI versus CF-WBI (adjusted difference, $6375; 95% confidence interval, $6147–$6603). Mean patient out-of-pocket expenditure for HF-WBI was $139 less than that for CF-WBI. Geographic variation existed across the United States in HF-WBI use (range, 9.6%-36.2%), with no consistent relationship between HF-WBI use and corresponding average cost differences between HF-WBI and CF-WBI. Conclusions: If trends continue, HF-WBI will soon become the dominant form of radiation treatment in the United States. Although HF-WBI represents significant savings to the health care system and individual patients, no evidence indicated that a financial disincentive had slowed adoption of HF-WBI. Therefore, multilevel approaches, including individuals, the community, and health policy, should be used to promote cost-effective cancer care. Innovations to policies on cost-effective radiation therapy treatment might consider non-financial incentives to promote HF-WBI use. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2022,,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,112,3,654-662,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.10.005,,#91,Saulsberry 2022,"",""
Fashion Promotion on Instagram with Eye Tracking: Curvy Girl Influencers Versus Fashion Brands in Spain and Portugal,"Manas-Viniegra, L.; Veloso, A.-I.; Cuesta, U.","The rise of Instagram, as the fastest growing social network in Spain and Portugal, and its incorporation into the communication strategies of beauty and fashion brands have posed some risks for younger followers in relation to the development of identity and self-esteem. A physical appearance acceptance movement has also begun, based on interaction with images, on which the social network is also based. The purpose of this research was to determine how attention is paid to fashion promotion and to the awareness of physical appearance acceptance by curvy influencers in comparison with communications by fashion brands on Instagram. The quantitative and qualitative methodology is based on the use of a biometric eye tracking technique applied to a sample of 120 participants from Spain and Portugal, matching the profile of the main users of Instagram: urban university women under 25 years old with an interest in fashion, and a self-perception as a curvy woman. The results point to more attention focused on the imperfections for which curvy influencers are raising awareness than on the fashion they promote when these awareness factors are more visible, as well as more attention focused on the fashion accessories worn by curvy brand models than those worn by the influencers, with specific and significant differences between Spanish and Portuguese audiences.",2019,07/,Sustainability,11,14,3977 (18 pp.),,10.3390/su11143977,,#92,Manas-Viniegra 2019,"",""
Female citation impact superiority 1996-2018 in six out of seven English-speaking nations,"Thelwall, M.","Efforts to combat continuing gender inequalities in academia need to be informed by evidence about where differences occur. Citations are relevant as potential evidence in appointment and promotion decisions, but it is unclear whether there have been historical gender differences in average citation impact that might explain the current shortfall of senior female academics. This study investigates the evolution of gender differences in citation impact 1996-2018 for six million articles from seven large English-speaking nations: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, New Zealand, UK, and the USA. The results show that a small female citation advantage has been the norm over time for all these countries except the USA, where there has been no practical difference. The female citation advantage is largest, and statistically significant in most years, for Australia and the UK. This suggests that any academic bias against citing female-authored research cannot explain current employment inequalities. Nevertheless, comparisons using recent citation data, or avoiding it altogether, during appointments or promotion may disadvantage females in some countries by underestimating the likely greater impact of their work, especially in the long term.",2020,08/,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,71,8,979-90,,10.1002/asi.24316,,#93,Thelwall 2020,"",""
Identifying the factors influencing digital library use among research students: a case of National Digital Library of Pakistan,"Mubeen, Iqra; Soroya, Saira Hanif; Mahmood, Khalid","Purpose: As the revolution of information takes place, industrialized societies are going to become information societies. Developing countries such as Pakistan are going to change due to technology and, in turn, transform the whole structure of libraries. The concept of digital libraries (DL) has emerged due to technological advancements. This study aims to highlight the factors that encourage and discourage the use of the Higher Education Commission’s (HEC) National Digital Library (NDL). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research approach was selected for the investigation, while the data collection instrument was a questionnaire. Postgraduate research students were the population of the study. A convenient sampling technique was used for sample selection. Findings: The results of the study indicated that the use of HEC (NDL) was frequent monthly. The display of search results, 24/7 access, the authenticity of items, availability of navigational assistance and up-to-date information encourage researchers to use DL. However, their preference for print material over electronic material, slow downloading speed of the internet and non-availability of older and archival publications were the common reasons for the low use of DL. Furthermore, there are significant differences in terms of using the NDL based on gender, the program of study and the stage of the study.

Enhancing TOEFL Performance and Student Motivation through Integrated Flipped and Gamified Learning in Online Settings,"Arsyad, S.; Waluyo, B.; Maisarah, I.","In the evolving landscape of education, the integration of flipped and gamified learning into online English courses has remained a complex and underexplored terrain. To address this knowledge gap, our study designed and implemented an innovative hybrid pedagogical model, seamlessly blending flipped and gamified learning principles into the context of online TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) instruction. The study, conducted within a public university in Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, included 27 carefully selected research participants (11.1% male, 88.9% female) from a population of 80 third-year undergraduate English majors, employing purposive convenient sampling techniques to ensure diversity representation. Our comprehensive data collection encompassed pre- and post-TOEFL assessments, surveys, and reflective essays, with qualitative data subjected to thematic analysis and quantitative data analyzed through descriptive statistics, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank tests, and Spearman's correlation analysis. The results unveiled a multifaceted landscape, showing improvements in student enjoyment and motivation alongside increased anxiety. However, the intervention demonstrated significant enhancements in TOEFL listening, reading, and overall scores, although structure and written expression remained largely unchanged. Intriguingly, while heightened enjoyment correlated with increased motivation, emotional variables displayed no significant correlation with TOEFL posttest scores.

Social Marketing in Promoting Sustainable Healthy Lifestyle among Student Population,"Milicevic, N.; Djokic, I.; Djokic, N.; Grubor, A.","Although there are some differences in healthy lifestyle measurement, physical activity is an indispensable factor within that construct. By increasing the level of physical activity of the population, the contribution to social sustainability is provided. Social marketing can be considered as a manner to promote behavior change (including increase in physical activity level). It uses commercial marketing tools in delivering social goods. In that context can be explained previous uses of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in social marketing researches aiming at increasing the level of physical activity of the population. In this paper, the modified TPB model, extended with self-identity and motivation variable, is implemented within the student population of the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, in 2019. The results show that intention to do regular physical activity in the week after the research was directly influenced by behavioral and normative beliefs and self-identity. It was influenced indirectly by students' motivation. The motivation, however, directly affects students' behavioral, normative and control beliefs. Nevertheless, the results differ among genders; although positive at both genders, the effects of normative beliefs and motivation on intention were significant only in female students (0.123 and 0.243, respectively). The authors also provide social marketing implications, i.e., potential activities within social marketing that could be performed in order to encourage students to be more physically active. In addition to belonging to relatively scarce similar researches in domestic context, the wider contribution of this paper can be identified from a methodological aspect, treating the behavioral, normative and control beliefs as formative constructs.",2022,/,Sustainability,14,3,1874 (14 pp.),,10.3390/su14031874,,#96,Milicevic 2022,"",""
"Patterns of Care and Outcomes in Non-Operative, Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer when Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy is not Feasible","Schneider, C.S.; Stahl, J.M.; Bonner, J.A.; Kole, A.J.","Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care treatment for non-operative patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there are cases where safe delivery of SBRT is precluded (e.g., ultracentral tumors or those abutting brachial plexus/stomach) or where SBRT is not available (e.g., centers without SBRT capability). The optimal management with regards to radiation dose/fractionation and whether sensitizing chemotherapy should be considered is unclear. Materials/Methods: We identified node-negative NSCLC patients with tumors 10≥100 Gy) were excluded. The use of chemotherapy (none vs. sequential vs. concurrent) and RT type was examined (conventionally fractionated, [CFRT], defined as 59.4-70.2 Gy in 30-39 fractions; and hypofractionated RT [HFRT] defined as 50-72 Gy in >5 fractions using >2 Gy/fraction). Factors associated with receipt of chemotherapy were analyzed via univariable (UV) and multivariable (MV) logistic regression. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test as well as UV and MV Cox proportional hazards. Propensity score matching was also performed for comparison of OS between groups. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: A total of 2,851 patients were included with 69% receiving CFRT and 31% receiving HFRT. Nearly 26% of patients received chemotherapy, delivered either concurrently (21%) or sequentially (5%). On MV analysis, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with younger age (10< 80 Gy (p< 0.001) and receipt of CFRT (p< 0.001). OS was significantly improved for patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy with CFRT compared to patients receiving CFRT alone (p< 0.001) and HFRT alone (p=0.003), which remained significant after propensity score matching. On MV analysis, improved OS remained associated with concurrent chemotherapy (p< 0.001), as was younger age (< 70 years, p=0.024), female gender (p< 0.001), fewer comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo score < 2, p< 0.001), private insurance (p< 0.001), treatment at an academic center (p=0.026), smaller tumor size (< 2 cm, p< 0.001), and non-squamous histology (p=0.004).Conclusion: Patterns of care for non-operative early-stage NSCLC patients when SBRT is not feasible vary greatly. A surprising proportion of patients (21%) receive concurrent chemotherapy. Interestingly, concurrent chemotherapy with CFRT was associated with improved OS compared to HFRT or CFRT alone, however this finding requires additional validation given the inherent biases of our study.

Broadening participation in computing: Examining experiences of girls of color,"Scott, Allison; McAlear, Frieda; Martin, Alexis; Koshy, Sonia","In order to enhance participation in computer science for girls of color, this study examines the outcomes of a rigorous out-of-school culturally relevant computer science intervention designed to engage underrepresented students in computing. Findings demonstrated that withinrace gender differences exist in early interest in computing. Female students of color demonstrated significantly lower engagement and interest in computing, suggesting that being a member of a marginalized gender group plays a unique role and has a multiplying (negative) effect. Further, there were still significant gender differences in computing engagement after participation in one summer of the computer science intervention. Promising outcomes were revealed among a group of students who chose to enroll in the optional Advanced Placement CS A preparatory course; there were no gender differences in enrollment and completion of the course. In examining longitudinal outcomes, gender is a significant predictor of majoring in computer science in college, with male students much more likely to major in computer science than female students. These findings have important implications for addressing the gender gap in computing, including understanding how the intersection of race and gender presents unique barriers and challenges for women of color in computing, and that interventions to broaden participation in computing must address the unique experiences of women of color.

Effects of visual stimulation using wooden-wall images with different amounts of knots on psychological and physiological responses,"Nakamura, M.; Ikei, H.; Miyazaki, Y.","Wood is an important material used in decorating human living environment. Knots are prominent features found on wood surface. Moreover, they are commonly considered as undesirable surface defects, which reduce not only the mechanical properties but also the aesthetic qualities of lumber. The effects of visual stimulation using knotty wood on psychological responses among humans have been relatively well investigated. However, only few studies have assessed physiological responses. Hence, the present study aimed to assess whether knotty wood surface can reduce not only psychological but also physiological benefits for humans. Two full-sized knotty wooden-wall images and a clear wooden-wall image were used as visual stimuli using computer graphics techniques. Twenty-eight adult Japanese female university students viewed each image for 90 s in random order. During exposure to the visual stimuli, the oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the left and right prefrontal cortex and heart rate variability were consecutively measured and utilized as indicators of central and autonomic nervous system activities, respectively. In addition, the psychological effects of knotty images were examined using the modified semantic differential method and the Profile of Mood State 2nd Edition. There was no significant difference in the effects of the three images on physiological responses. All visual stimuli more or less promoted psychological comfort and relaxation. However, compared with the clear wooden-wall image, the wooden-wall image with several knots was associated with reduced psychological benefits, and the psychological responses in viewing the wooden-wall image with few knots did not remarkably differ.",2022,/,Wood Science and Technology,,,1869-86,,10.1007/s00226-022-01419-5,,#100,Nakamura 2022,"",""

Scenario-based eLearning to promote active learning in large cohorts: Students' perspective,"Mio, Cristina; Ventura-Medina, Esther; Joao, Elsa","This work presents results from an investigation on the students' perspective of the use of scenario-based (SBL) e-learning and their performance in a first-year core chemical engineering module in a Scottish university. SBL is a pedagogy that promotes active learning by bringing to the classroom practical and industrial experience. When combined with online delivery, SBL can be used to increase students' engagement in large cohorts. The scenario developed and used in this work was delivered via the Scenario-Based Learning Interactive tool. A survey was used to capture students' insights on the activity and the use of the software. These data were then analyzed in combination with students' exam performance. Two cohorts with around 100 students each participated in this study over 2 years (with 91% response rate in the evaluation questionnaire). They indicate that students fully engaged with this form of learning as it links module content with real industrial applications. There is, however, a significant difference between female and male students in terms of the enjoyment they derived from the computer-based activity with male students preferring the activity over tutorials with opposite results for females. There is no relationship between the perceived level of difficulty of the scenario and the exam performance in either cohort. The majority of students identified that they developed their problem-solving and analytical skills through doing the scenario activity. In general, the students found the software difficult to use which suggests the need to explore other tools for the delivery of scenario-based activities. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2019,,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,27,4,894-909,,10.1002/cae.22123,,#103,Mio 2019,"",""
The effect of an individual's education level on their systems skills in the system of systems domain,"Ullah Ibne Hossain, Niamat; Nagahi, Morteza; Jaradat, Raed; Stirgus, Erin; Keating, Charles B.","Today's rapid proliferation of information and technological advancements has led to complex and uncertain modern systems environments. The problems resulting from this increased complexity may surpass engineers’ current capacity to perform effectively within the domain of complex systems. In response to this situation, the concept of Systems Thinking (ST) has been advanced as an aid to building a mental map that offers a robust conceptual understanding to offset the challenges of modern system of systems (SoS) problems. Although there has been some research regarding the effect of age and gender on ST preferences, there is still a lack of studies investigating how an individual's ST skills preferences in system of systems (SoS) domain vary across educational qualifications. In addition, most of the extant literature focuses on one or two measures to assess the individual ST; thus, there is a need to include the full spectrum of ST measures to assess the ST skills preferences of an individual in the domain of complex systems. To address these gaps, this research uses an established ST skills preferences instrument to gauge an individual’s ST skills preferences in the SoS domain based on the educational qualifications. Two hundred and fifty-eight participants with educational qualifications ranging from non-degree to graduate degree participated in the research. The analysis of the responses was performed by a post-hoc test to show which groups differ significantly. From the results obtained through aggregate individual responses, we conclude that each group (i.e bachelor, masters and phD), possesses a different ST skills preference profile on average, and the educational qualifications in the SoS environment has a moderation impact on individuals’ system skills preferences. © 2020 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",2020,,Journal of Management Analytics,7,4,510-531,,10.1080/23270012.2020.1811788,,#105,UllahIbneHossain 2020,"",""

Psychogeography - providing a lens on corporate culture and its potential impact on career success: a novel and efficient approach,"Wardale, D.; Lord, L.","Psychogeography refers to the loose interface between psychology and geography. Specifically it examines how we impact on the environment and the environment impacts on us. As a process it involves intimately observing the environment and seeing what may have been previously unobserved. Participants then construct meaning from these observations. This paper describes how we used a time-limited psychogeography approach followed immediately by a focus group as research method. The aim was to determine if examining participants’ work environment would potentially enable them to identify enablers and barriers to career success. The findings from these two short interventions are compared to the more often used semi-structured interview approach to reveal that the psychogeography provided another lens to the research. Interestingly factors that were uncovered in the psychogeography and focus groups were generally different to those identified in the interviews. The participants were a group of high-potential academic women at a large public university in Western Australia. They were enrolled in a career and leadership development program aimed at assisting women access promotions and other senior roles leadership within the university Much of the women’s career development literature focuses on ‘fixing women’ and not the system. To that end we wanted to use a method, in addition to interview questions, to uncover aspects of the corporate environment that might impact on women’s decisions to progress their careers. We asked participants to dérive, stroll or wander within their university campus with a view to observing any ‘career enablers and barriers at work’. To not impose any further burden on their time, and to manage the wealth of data generated by the psychogeography, we asked the women to immediately share their insights through a structured focus group discussion. Participants found the psychogeography exercise a novel approach to discovering and rediscovering their work environment. The findings revealed aspects of the work environment that had not previously been overt. These included participants’ appreciation of students having fun and a carnival atmosphere within the campus yet a simultaneous concern at the lack of quiet spaces to support scholarship and research; a disparity of investment in infrastructure improvements across various schools and faculties, which led to discussions of how disparately workload was managed by different managers; staff being segregated from students and other staff with security doors; the number of steps at the university and the impact this would have on some people with a disability. One pleasing and unexpected outcome of the psychogeography exercise was the level of energy and collegiality it generated. The exercise was conducted at an early stage in an eight-month career development program and its use heightened participant’s awareness of aspects of their work environment’s impact on career success that may have otherwise remained uncovered or unexamined. Our view is that psychogeography; within a limited timeframe is a valuable method to employ. When the data from such a method is captured though a focus group the impost on participant’ times is lessened, the quality of data is retained with the combined research method producing novel findings that may be different to other more traditional qualitative research methods.

Generating a framework for gender and sexual diversity-inclusive STEM education,"Wright, G.W.; Delgado, C.","Students who identify as LGBTQ continue to report feelings of being unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Access to a gender and sexual diversity (GSD)-inclusive curriculum and supportive teachers may positively improve the school climate for LGBTQ students, but these supports are often not included in STEM classrooms. One response is to ensure that STEM teachers are prepared to integrate GSD-inclusive STEM teaching into their classrooms. This review systematically analyzed the literature on supporting and affirming GSD in K-12 and higher education STEM education contexts. The 81 selected studies were qualitatively analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and epistemic network analysis, and the findings showed that GSD-inclusive STEM education literature coheres around six highly related constructs: Heteronormativity, Social Justice, Epistemic Knowledge of Science and Inquiry, Identity, Embodiment, and GSD language. Identifying these constructs, and the connections among them, led to the generation of an operational framework of GSD-inclusive STEM teaching that can inform and guide STEM teacher education programs and STEM teacher professional development to develop STEM educators' equity literacy around GSD to foster bias-free, equitable, inclusive STEM classrooms. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2023,/,Science Education,,,713-40,,10.1002/sce.21786,,#110,Wright 2023,"",""
Bolstering the Persistence of Black Students in Undergraduate Computer Science Programs: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Belle, A.B.; Sutherland, C.; Adesina, O.O.; Kpodjedo, S.; Ojong, N.; Cole, L.","Background: People who are racialized, gendered, or otherwise minoritized are underrepresented in computing professions in North America. This is reflected in undergraduate computer science (CS) programs, in which students from marginalized backgrounds continue to experience inequities that do not typically affect White cis-men. This is especially true for Black students in general, and Black women in particular, whose experience of systemic, anti-Black racism compromises their ability to persist and thrive in CS education contexts. Objectives: This systematic mapping study endeavours to (1) determine the quantity of existing non-deficit-based studies concerned with the persistence of Black students in undergraduate CS; (2) summarize the findings and recommendations in those studies; and (3) identify areas in which additional studies may be required. We aim to accomplish these objectives by way of two research questions: (RQ1) What factors are associated with Black students' persistence in undergraduate CS programs?; and (RQ2) What recommendations have been made to further bolster Black students' persistence in undergraduate CS education programs? Methods: This systematic mapping study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines. Studies were identified by conducting keyword searches in seven databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to capture studies illuminating persistence factors for Black students in undergraduate CS programs. To ensure the completeness of our search results, we engaged in snowballing and an expert-based search to identify additional studies of interest. Finally, data were collected from each study to address the research questions outlined above. Results: Using the methods outlined above, we identified 16 empirical studies, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies informed by a range of theoretical frameworks. Based on data collected from the primary studies in our sample, we identified 13 persistence factors across four categories: (I) social capital, networking, & support; (II) career & professional development; (III) pedagogical & programmatic interventions; and (IV) exposure & access. This data-collection process also yielded 26 recommendations across six stakeholder groups: (i) researchers; (ii) colleges and universities; (iii) the computing industry; (iv) K-12 systems and schools; (v) governments; and (vi) parents. Conclusion: This systematic mapping study resulted in the identification of numerous persistence factors for Black students in CS. Crucially, however, these persistence factors allow Black students to persist, but not thrive, in CS. Accordingly, we contend that more needs to be done to address the systemic inequities faced by Black people in general, and Black women in particular, in computing programs and professions. As evidenced by the relatively small number of primary studies captured by this systematic mapping study, there exists an urgent need for additional, asset-based empirical studies involving Black students in CS. In addition to foregrounding the intersectional experiences of Black women in CS, future studies should attend to the currently understudied experiences of Black men.",2023,12/,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,23,4,40 (42 pp.),,10.1145/3617896,,#111,Belle 2023,"",""
Participation pathways for women into university makerspaces,"Tomko, M.; Aleman, M.W.; Newstetter, W.; Nagel, R.L.; Linsey, J.","Background: Engineering education has observed considerable growth in academic makerspaces with initial data indicating significant potential for makerspaces to support learning. Purpose/Hypothesis: Given gender disparities in engineering as a professional community of practice (CoP) and indications for makerspaces as sites for learning, educational researchers need to forge a better understanding of women's pathways into makerspaces, including the barriers that inhibit and the catalysts that broaden participation. Design/Method: This study employed qualitative interviews with 20 women students who were identified as makers in order to gain insights into the characteristics of their pathways into university makerspaces. Results: Using grounded theory development, four major aspects of students' pathways emerged: (1) early forms of apprenticeship through mentors; (2) overcoming and resisting limiting gendered expectations imposed by others in early experiences in unfamiliar makerspace CoPs, resulting in failed articulations of related communities; (3) successful articulations of community grounded in making-centered coursework and personal passions; and (4) relationships in college that expanded access, leadership, and visibility toward fuller participation in makerspace CoPs. Conclusion: Educational interventions to broaden women's participation in makerspaces must be multipronged and attend to early childhood experiences, include supportive opportunities for women to participate in making in K-12 and university curricula, expand definitions of making to legitimize the arts and crafts as part of design, and create apprenticeship opportunities for women to mentor women in makerspaces. We must change the narrative of who makers are, what making is, and who belongs in makerspaces to reduce barriers and create inclusive making communities. © 2021 ASEE.",2021,/,Journal of Engineering Education,110,3,700-17,,10.1002/jee.20402,,#113,Tomko 2021,"",""
Undergraduate physics students' experiences: Exploring the impact of underrepresented identities and intersectionality,"Keblbeck, D.K.; Piatek-Jimenez, K.; Medina Medina, C.","Historically, physics has been a predominantly male field, with previous literature showing that there is little diversity among U.S. physics students at the undergraduate and graduate levels or among physicists within the work force. Recent research indicates that the lack of diversity in physics is partially due to an unwelcoming climate within physics departments, as well as differential experiences during college. Most physics education research that addresses the lack of underrepresented identities within the field has focused on the identities of women and people of color. There has been little research to investigate people with multiple underrepresented identities, including those such as socioeconomic status, first-generation college students, or learning disabilities. Furthermore, there has been even less research conducted to better understand the impacts of the intersection of these underrepresented identities and how it relates to experiences when pursuing a physics major. In order to address this gap in the literature, our research project has investigated undergraduate physics students' experiences to better understand what factors affect their experiences and how these may differ by the intersection of one's underrepresented identities. In particular, we explored how these identities impact their experiences as a physics major. To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with physics majors at one university to learn more about their college experiences regarding physics. Our findings suggest that there is a disproportionate number of obstacles when pursuing a physics major faced by those with a greater number of underrepresented identities. We conclude that there is a need for more equitable pedagogical practices and departmental policies within the undergraduate physics experience, in addition to a more ""human"" approach to mentorship, in order to foster an environment in which students with underrepresented identities can feel supported and thrive academically and professionally. In particular, we believe that dedicated formal pedagogical trainings that teach diverse teaching skills to accommodate students with different learning styles would be useful to many university physics instructors. This type of formal training would include annual workshops designed to educate faculty on how curriculum, pedagogy, and departmental practices can be altered to be more inclusive with the intent to ensure a more equitable and welcoming experience for all students. Additionally, incorporating mentorship programs that focus on a more individualized and natural support system would likely benefit all students, especially those with underrepresented identities, by creating a more welcoming and inclusive space within physics departments.",2024,/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,20,2,020120 (17 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.020120,,#115,Keblbeck 2024,"",""
Perspectives on the contributions of women to the hydrologic sciences and their changing demographics at USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges,"Rustad, Lindsey; Adams, Mary Beth; Dymond, Salli F.; Gregory, Margaret; Miniat, Chelcy F.","The increase in the frequency and severity of water crises around the world necessitates maintaining or augmenting investments in the hydrologic sciences, including in a trained, diverse workforce. The USDA Forest Service operates a network of 85 Experimental Forests and Ranges, Experimental Watersheds, and cooperating sites (EFRs), 31 of which include long-term hydrologic studies (HydroEFRs). The HydroEFRs are centers for hydrologic science and education and play a key role informing watershed policy and management. The goals of this study were to understand (1) how, broadly, the women associated with the HydroEFRs (including women in the Forest Service workforce and women with cooperating agencies or universities who have worked at HydroEFRs) have contributed to hydrologic sciences and (2) how, more specifically, the number and roles of women in the Forest Service workforce associated with the HydroEFRs have changed over time. Data were collected from the EFR Data Explorer, the USDA Forest Service Human Resources Management (HRM) Data Metrics and Analysis Team (DMAT), literature reviews, and questionnaires to USDA EFR scientists-in-charge and to women who were or had been involved in hydrologic sciences at EFRs. Results showed that women associated with the HydroEFRs have made significant contributions to the hydrologic sciences, including authoring or co-authoring over 3,000 publications, with over 170,000 citations since 1977 and an H-index of 181. In their own words, the women indicated that they were also active in contributing to hydrologic fieldwork, providing stewardship for long-term data, and contributing to the social capital of the HydroEFRs through teamwork, collaboration, and mentoring. For the Forest Service, trends in employment records from 1992 through 2021 showed a 55% contraction of the entire FS R&D workforce, including a 59% loss in the number of women in the FS R&D workforce, a 50% loss in the number of women associated with HydroEFR duty stations, and a 26% loss in the number of women in hydrology positions. During this period, there was a greater loss of both women and men in lower-graded positions relative to higher-graded positions in the FS R&D workforce, with serial implications for the ability of the workforce to collect data, produce basic science publications, and conduct syntheses. Although the ratio of women:men declined across the Forest Service and FS R&D, the ratio of women:men increased at the HydroEFRs (driven by a higher ratio of women:men at higher grade levels) and for management positions within FS R&D and at the HydroEFRs.When asked, women valued their contributions to the hydrologic sciences and envisioned a more equitable future for women in hydrology. Overall, results show that HydroEFRs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences, who, in turn, have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long-term research sites. As water crises around the world continue to escalate, building a strong, diverse workforce in the hydrologic sciences and supporting the places where they can conduct their research is important. © 2023",2023,,Journal of Hydrology,621,,,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129469,,#116,Rustad 2023,"",""
Women and men in the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine: workforce survey,"Bezak, Eva; Suchowerska, Roksolana; Claridge Mackonis, Elizabeth; Pillen, Heath; Ralston, Anna; Haworth, Annette; Suchowerska, Natalka","A survey was designed to determine aspirations, motivations and workplace experiences of both female and male members of the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). The survey collected both quantitate and qualitative data, including open ended questions. This paper reports the survey’s qualitative results. The research was approved by Ethics at University of South Australia and endorsed by ACPSEM. All 205 women (30% of total membership) and 440 men were invited to complete the survey online. The data for the qualitative analysis were responses to open-ended questions within the survey. 102 women and 150 men completed surveys were received, with 66 surveys analysed, before data saturation was reached. The survey revealed a number of themes that reflect concerns and opportunities identifying the direction for improving work-life balance and gender equity within the medical physics profession in Australasia. Issues around managing challenging workloads and professional development were amplified for women with children and child-rearing responsibilities, directly contributing to a reduction in work capacity and a reorientation of work-life priorities. The survey provides direction for strategies to improve work-life balance and enable equitable engagement in the profession. The first is to identify and develop role models that actively model successful work-life balance and flexibility in gender roles and in professional conduct. The second is to improve the management skills of current and emerging administrators, advocating for improved work conditions for medical physics professionals at an organisation level. Finally, efforts need to be made to establish flexible professional development and career progression opportunities amongst those that are unable to commit to large workloads, which is common for those with child-rearing responsibilities. The realisation of these strategic goals will reduce the identified barriers to full female participation in the workforce, and shift gender-based subcultures within the workplace. © 2018, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2019,,Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,42,1,33-41,,10.1007/s13246-018-0706-z,,#117,Bezak 2019,"",""

Findings In comparison to male participants, female I-Corps participants reported less entrepreneurial experience prior to the program, poorer team relationships during the program and lower entrepreneurial intention and technology commercialization readiness at both the beginning and the end of the program. However, no gender differences were found in positive or negative perceptions of the instructional climate or perceptions of program usefulness. Originality/value This study is unique as it is based on a large-scale dataset drawn from sites across the United States. The results support potential changes to I-Corps and similar programs, including providing more explicit instructions for tasks with which female participants have less prior experience than males (e.g. in applying for patents), offering guidance for team interactions, and providing mentorship to assess whether low self-efficacy is leading women to underestimate the potential success of their projects.",2022,/,International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship,14,1,117-41,,10.1108/IJGE-10-2020-0166,,#118,Epstein 2022,"",""

Paving the way and passing the torch: mentors’ motivation and experience of supporting women in optical engineering,"Kodate, Naonori; Kodate, Kashiko; Kodate, Takako","The phenomenon of women's underrepresentation in engineering is well known. However, the slow progress in achieving better gender equality here compared with other domains has accentuated the ‘numbers’ issue, while the quality aspects have been largely ignored. This study aims to shed light on both these aspects via the lens of mentors, who are at the coalface of guiding female engineers through their education and subsequent careers. Based on data collected from 25 mentors (8 men and 17 women from 8 countries), the paper explores their experiences of being mentors, as well as their views on recommended actions for nurturing female engineers. The findings reveal that the primary motivation for becoming a mentor was personal for men and women. Many mentors from countries with relatively lower female labour participation rates perceive their roles as guarantors of their mentees’ successful future career paths, and a similar trend can be found in mentors in academia.

What we can learn from elite academic staff publication portfolios: a social network analysis,"Grant, M.J.; Lotto, R.R.; Jones, I.D.","Purpose- The study aims to construct an understanding of professional academic writing network structures to inform organisational strategic investment in academic staff development. Design/methodology/approach - Longitudinal social network analysis is used to examine the personalnetworks evident in the publication portfolios of a purposive sample of four international academics across each quartile of the SCOPUS defined area of General Nursing’s top 100 authors. Findings - Trends in the publication portfolios of elite academics across gender, sector and geographic location are presented. In the first years of successful writing for publication, authors collaborate within a single highly connected co-author network. This network will typically expand to include new co-authors, before additional separate co-author collaborations emerge (threeto fouryears). Authors experience steady growth in co-author numbers fourto sevenyears from first co-authored publication. After a period of rapid expansion, these collaborations coalesce into a smaller number of highly connected groups (eightto tenyears). Most collaborations occur within the higher education sector and across multiple disciplines including medicine, social sciences and psychology. Male co-authors are disproportionately represented in what is a predominantly female profession. Practical implications - The development of extended co-author networks, locally, internationally and across the higher education sector, enable authors to attain the marker of achievement required by universities and government funding bodies, namely sustained output of academic publications. Identified trends support the inclusion of investment in academic time and resources in higher education institutions strategic and operational plans to enable academic staff to develop interdisciplinary professional networks. In focussing this investment on gender equality, female academics will experience parity of opportunity in achieving their organisational and personal goals relating to professional academic writing. Medium-term investment may be required before the impact of that investment becomes apparent.

Undergraduate Engineering Students’ Understanding of Engineering Disciplines: An Empirical Study,"Onal, Sinan; Temko, Ezra","This study investigates the perceived familiarity with different engineering disciplines among engineering students at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville (SIUE), with a focus on disparities across gender, race, and academic majors. Data were collected via an online Qualtrics survey from undergraduate engineering students at SIUE during the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters. The survey, which achieved a 25% response rate with 275 completed surveys, assessed students’ ability to identify six key engineering disciplines. Quantitative analysis methods, including linear regression and multivariate analysis, were applied to examine how demographic factors influence students’ familiarity and identification skills. Weighted data were used in the analysis to correct for non-response bias related to gender, race, and major selection. Findings indicate notable disparities: male and White students exhibited higher familiarity compared to Female and Gender Queer (FGQ) students and students of color, especially Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. Students enrolled in broad-based and interdisciplinary engineering programs demonstrated better overall understanding than their peers in more specialized programs. The study confirms that perceived familiarity significantly predicts correct identification, suggesting that increased educational exposure to various engineering fields can enhance accuracy. These results underscore the importance of revising educational curricula to include more inclusive and comprehensive exposure to all engineering disciplines. Interventions such as redesigned coursework, expanded mentorship programs, and increased support for underrepresented groups are recommended to address the observed disparities.

Career choices in information and communication technology among South Western Nigerian women,"Ojokoh, Bolanle Adefowoke; Adeola, Oladele Stephen; Isinkaye, Folasade Olubusola; Abraham, Chon","This study is designed to discover the key factors for the under-representation and lack of career progression or otherwise of women in the ICT field, specifically in South Western Nigeria. Questionnaires were administered to women (i.e., students, lecturers and other staff) studying or working in selected higher institutions. The results show that 90% of the women studied are self-motivated in their choice of the ICT career with very little external incentivizing or encouragement supporting their choice, besides the lure of high compensation and prestige associated with skilled ICT work. The slight influence on the career choice of women to pursue ICT derives from everyday use of computers and career information provided by role models and mentors, which are atypical, while, those women who did not choose a career in ICT did so because of their perception of the overabundance of required programming skills. Other barriers include environmental working conditions, infrastructure and electricity in the work area needed to support ICT related work. Although, many of the career women believe that they are competitive with their male counterparts in ICT; the fact remains in South Western Nigeria that only a few women are senior associates at organizations in the ICT field. Recommendations are offered to decrease this disparity and address enabling conditions for change.

“Simply the best”: Professors nominated by students for their exemplary technology practices in teaching,"Jorgensen, M.; Havel, A.; Fichten, C.; King, L.; Marcil, E.; Lussier, A.; Budd, J.; Vitouchanskaia, C.","Our goal was to explore the technology related pedagogical practices of college professors deemed by their students to be excellent in using technology in their teaching. We explored the views of 114 community/junior college professors who were nominated by their students as excellent in using technology in their teaching using both questionnaires and interview methods. Results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show no gender or years teaching in college differences in professors’ self rated proficiency or comfort with technologies. Results also show that most professors taught themselves how to use technologies with the help of online resources, through trial and error, and with help from colleagues and support staff. Challenges using technology were related primarily to technical problems, such as technologies not working and the institution’s computers and networks being slow. However, professors in our sample usually had a back-up plan and found ways to carry on even if the technology failed. Our findings report on the most and least frequently used technologies in face-to-face teaching, on how professors typically used the course management system, on how professors communicate with students, including the very small number who used social media to do this, and the likelihood of allowing students to use their personal mobile technology in class. Our findings also show that the professors showed their students how to use technologies required for the course. We discuss the practical significance of our findings and their implications for faculty, students, and the institution itself.

The Underrepresentation of Women in Computing Fields: A Synthesis of Literature Using a Life Course Perspective,"Main, J.B.; Schimpf, C.","Using a life course perspective, this literature review synthesizes research on women’s underrepresentation in computing fields across four life stages: 1) pre-high school; 2) high school; 3) college major choice and persistence; and 4) post-baccalaureate employment. Issues associated with access to, and use of, computing resources at the pre-high school and high school levels are associated with gender differences in interest and attitudes toward computing. At the college level, environmental context (classroom design, interactions with peers and role models, signals from stereotypical images) contribute to whether students will major in computing, whereas psychosocial factors (e.g., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) and departmental culture play a role in persistence in computing fields. As in other fields, issues associated with work-life conflict, occupational culture, and mentoring/networking opportunities play a role in women’s participation in the computing workforce. Several initiatives and programs have been implemented to address women’s underrepresentation in computing fields. While great strides have been made in making computing more accessible, the life course perspective highlights the importance of longitudinal studies in identifying students’ pathways to and through computing fields, as well as how interventions across life stages may intersect or cumulate to generate trends in computing participation.",2017,11/,IEEE Transactions on Education,60,4,296-304,,10.1109/TE.2017.2704060,,#134,Main 2017,"",""
Research of the college coaches evaluation index system based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model,"Chen, Jing Fei; Yang, Aimin; Zhou, Xin; Yan, Longge","In order to know how to choose the best college coach or coaches, a mathematic model will be built in this paper. Firstly, according to Delphi method and CES scale, the indicator system of coaches' competence is given and improved. Thus nine indicators for evaluation of best coaches are determined. We know the most influenced factors are won pct,years,popularity through weighted analysis. By applying Matlab, gain the weight vector A = (0.5464, 0.1804, 0.2732)T. At the same time, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of both male and female college coaches in basketball, ice hockey and soccer are gained as follows respectively: 146.576, 152.6493, 127.0001, 147.8392. An outstanding test is conducted on comprehensive evaluation, and there is no big difference in each evaluation indicator. The evaluation model of best college coaches can be applied to all projects and genders based on fuzzy mathematics. Secondly, after the study of teaching methods of PE coaches, the indicators of best representative coaches are chosen across the whole America. Data are integrated, and then a line chart is drawn, in which each indicator changes with time. Pct changes obviously in this chart and the other three indicators change within a certain range. All this shows that teaching methods of college coaches change evidently. Finally, choose data of top 50 college coaches in baseball,football and softball in America. Based on Principal factor weight vector in this model, A = (0.5464, 0.1804, 0.2732)T, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is gained.

Vex robotics competitions: Gender differences in student attitudes and experiences,"Sullivan, Amanda; Bers, Marina Umaschi","Aim/Purpose Educational robotics competitions are a popular way to increase students' inter-est in science and engineering during their K-12 years. However, female stu-dents are typically underrepresented in these competitions. The goal of this study is to determine differences in the experiences of male and female robotics competition students in order to better support female students and increase their representation in competition leagues. Background VEX Robotics Competitions are one of the fastest-growing educational robot-ics competitions available to middle school and high school students around the world. Despite growing numbers of participants, VEX programs have a notice-able lack of female participants. In order to create a more diverse and repre-sentative program, it is important to investigate why fewer female students par-ticipate in the competitions and what can be done to better support female stu-dents. Methodology Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from VEX mentors and stu-dents through online surveys. A total sample of N=675 VEX mentors and stu-dents participated (n=47 students and n=628 mentors). The surveys asked scaled, multiple choice, and free response questions. Through these surveys, the following research questions are answered: 1) What (if any) are the differences between male and female student experiences with VEX? 2) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' confidence in their technical ability? and 3) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' perfor-mance on VEX related robotics team tasks? Contribution This study contributes to the growing body of work on engaging female stu-dents, and other underrepresented students, in STEM fields such as program-ming, engineering, and robotics.

Whilst a large amount of research has investigated the implementation of mobile technologies in education, there is still a paucity of research from a teaching perspective across disciplines within higher education. For this reason, this study investigated the acceptance, preparedness and adoption of mobile technologies by academic faculties within higher education, using the context of China. Underpinned by the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Model, a large-scale quantitative survey investigated the factors affecting academics’ behavioural intentions and use for mobile technologies, and variations between different demographic groups. Findings suggested that the most significant factors affecting academics’ behavioural intention and behaviours of use were their performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and habit. Behavioural intention also affected how the faculty staff used their mobile technologies. Moreover, gender, age, teaching experience and discipline were found to be moderating factors. This research provides further verification of the effectiveness of the UTAUT2 Model in the higher education context and the field of new technologies implementation.

Whether to flip Extreme Apprenticeship: which is more effective in programming instruction?,"Hopcan, S.; Polat, E.; Albayrak, E.","Programming knowledge is more important than ever in the digital world. However, teaching programming can be challenging, especially with novice learners. Considerable research has been conducted into the most effective methods for teaching programming. Extreme apprenticeship, a variation of cognitive apprenticeship, is a method that has been used in teaching programming at university level in recent years. Because this method focuses particularly on completing lots of exercises with coaching and guidance, it may solve many problems related to learning programming. Flipped learning can be useful for student preparedness and providing sufficient theoretical knowledge at the beginning of the course. This study compares the applications of the extreme apprenticeship method, flipped extreme apprenticeship, and traditional classroom, analyzing them at the university level in terms of their effects on academic achievement and engagement coupled with gender differences. The findings of the study indicate that the extreme apprenticeship and flipped extreme apprenticeship instructional methods improve academic achievement and student engagement in introductory programming more than the traditional method.

Teachers are a group of people with greater professional pressure. The pressure sources include students, schools and society. OBJECTIVE: This exploration aims to explore the professional pressure and mental health of college teachers. METHOD: Based on the expectancy theory, the professional pressure and mental health of different college teachers are investigated. The overall steps are as follows: the determination of topic, questionnaire design, questionnaire distribution and recovery, questionnaire data analysis to obtain results, as well as countermeasure analysis based on the results. RESULTS: The investigation suggests that the sores of college teachers' work pressure load, family life pressure, interpersonal pressure, physical and mental pressure, leadership and organizational factors pressure, career development pressure, scientific research, and professional title pressure are high. From senior to elementary, the pressure of teachers increases first and then decreases.

Impact of a Virtual Introduction to Radiation Oncology Lecture on Stimulating Specialty Interest among Diverse Medical Students at Multiple Institutions,"Mattes, M.D.; Gayed, G.; Thomas, C.R.; Deville, C.","Purpose/Objective(s)Many US medical students lack access to basic education in radiation oncology (RO). This is particularly common at schools with higher enrollment of students underrepresented in medicine (UIM), which may contribute to inadequate diversity in the RO workforce. We hypothesize that a virtual, cross-institutional lecture introducing students to a career in RO will be valuable to students less likely to have access to it otherwise, and increase their interest in RO as a career.Materials/MethodsA 1-hour, live, virtual, extracurricular lecture was offered to all (A) 15 US medical schools with at least 15% enrollment of UIM students per AAMC data, (B) 23 other medical schools lacking an affiliated RO residency program or department, and (C) a convenience sample of 22 medical student groups comprised of primarily UIM members at any US medical schools with contact information available online. Each lecture was promoted broadly, and the overall number of students invited is unknown. The lectures were given individually to each school by a singular academic radiation oncologist. A post-lecture electronic survey of 6 multiple choice and Likert-type questions was used to capture data from participating students. Descriptive statistics are reported. The Fisher's Exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare subgroups of students based on medical school year, gender, race, ethnicity, and presence of affiliated RO department.Results197 students from 13 institutions attended a lecture, and 114 responded to the survey (response rate 58%). Students' demographics included: 68% 1st years, 59% female, 42% white, 32% Asian, 13% Black, 15% Hispanic, and 61% from a school without a RO department. When coordinated by an UIM student group, 60% of respondents were UIM, as compared to 16% UIM respondents when promoted to all medical students (p p=0.05). Only 19 students (17%) reported previously hearing a RO lecture. 98 students (86%) expressed more interest in pursuing a career in RO after the lecture. There was no significant difference in interest in RO for any demographic subgroups of participants. 18 students (16%) contacted the speaker afterwards for guidance on research or mentorship opportunities locally or nationally.ConclusionVirtual RO exposure was feasible to deliver to students less likely to be exposed, and successfully stimulated interest in the specialty among most students regardless of their gender, race, or ethnicity. Sustainable pathways are needed to link these students to RO departments with mentors and sponsors who can help facilitate a more diverse RO workforce.

Design/methodology/approach Over the course of one semester, four undergraduate teaching assistants documented their experience through reflexive journals that were analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Findings Undergraduate teaching assistants characterised their experience as providing professional development and learning to connect with student learners. Findings suggest that relationality may be an important factor in student engagement and learning. Practical implications Understanding the experience of undergraduate teaching assistants can help develop targeted opportunities to enhance career readiness. Exploring the role of relationality could be important in the training and development of the Emirati workforce and help address some of the gaps in skills. Understanding the way in which undergraduate teaching assistants perceive their teaching experience can also provide faculty with insight into their teaching practices. Originality/value This exploratory study shows that students are able to acquire skills that may be applied in a variety of work settings (e.g. balancing multiple responsibilities). However, undergraduate teaching assistants expressed wanting to connect with student learners; this may be more culturally rooted and is less explored within the Emirati context. Given the socio-cultural context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), female Emiratis may benefit from work-type opportunities, which to the authors' knowledge has not been explored previously.",2022,/,"Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning",12,1,64-77,,10.1108/HESWBL-03-2021-0045,,#154,Patka 2022,"",""
Balancing on the road less traveled,"Banerjee, Ruma","Sitting down to the task of writing, I found my pen drifting inexorably to a personal recollection of the metaphorical transcontinental road that I had traveled to become a scientist, instead of reviewing a facet of our scientific contributions. Factors that prepared me for my improbable journey in an era when international calls were operator-assisted and unaffordable and the internet was the stuff of science fiction were my family’s love and the sheltered environment of my all-girls school and college experiences, which nurtured my self-confidence. The path of scientific inquiry is heady, and it is hard. The paucity of diversity, of women and minorities, particularly as the road steepens, helps perpetuate stereotypes and inadvertently encourages disparities. It is my hope that by sharing snippets of my journey, enriched as it has been by a diversity of mentors, mentees, colleagues, and friends, and the opportunity to express my curiosity and creativity, that a young person contemplating the scientific road will find encouragement. © 2019 Banerjee.

Promoting educational opportunity and achievement through 1:1 iPads,"Thieman, G.Y.; Cevallos, T.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to expand the growing body of research on the educational impact of 1:1 mobile devices, investigating the iPad’s potential to reduce the disparity of access to high-quality instructional technology and achievement for low income, racially, and linguistically diverse students. Design/methodology/approach - This three-year, mixed-method study investigated the degree to which a 1:1 iPad initiative reduced the disparity of technology access and instructional use and improved student learning and attendance. The research design included survey data on student technology skills, experiences and use and teacher focus groups to confirm and contextualize the survey data. Findings - Across all three years, ninth graders and students who were white, female, eligible for free/reduced lunch and those with stable enrollment were more likely to have an individual iPad (THP). Having a THP was associated with greater satisfaction, ease and frequency of technology use, higher attendance and GPA. Research limitations/implications - Inequitable distribution, inconsistent administrative support, and uneven faculty support for iPads limit generalizability. Practical implications - This research identifies barriers to successful technology integration and impact on student achievement including inequitable access, inconsistent administrative and teacher support, and limited professional development.

An exploratory study of instructors' perceptions on inclusion of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education,"Kumi-Yeboah, Alex; Amponsah, Samuel","The rapid growth of diverse learners in online learning has made it imperative for online instructors to incorporate multicultural resource curricula and instructional activities. This research aimed to explore online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education; examine how instructors integrate culturally responsive pedagogy strategies in the online learning environment; and explore the challenges in facilitating cross-cultural collaborative learning for students from different cultural backgrounds. Data were collected following a qualitative multi-site case study method with five academic disciplines (Education, Social Sciences, Engineering, Physical Sciences and Health Sciences) in 12 colleges and universities in the United States of America. In all, 60 in-depth and semi-structured interviews with instructors (26 females and 34 males) were obtained and analysed following a constant comparative analysis approach. Results reflected that the instructors used cross-cultural interactions to facilitate students' engagement and incorporated culturally responsive teaching. Besides, the findings revealed that most of the instructors integrated diverse and internationalized learning content to support diverse students and addressed the impact of multicultural education in online learning. It was, however, noted, that instructors in the physical science disciplines struggled to incorporate culturally diverse contents in their online classes. The findings of this study foster discourse on how best instructors could be aided to engage diverse students online more meaningfully. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Since studies of this nature are mostly undertaken in teaching and learning environments that are diverse in terms of student populations, both students and instructors are exposed to cultural differences in teaching and learning in multicultural/diverse online learning environments. Studies on multicultural/diverse online learning environments abound and have been undertaken for several years but the emphasis has mainly been to explore issues from the perspectives of students. Most online instructors assume that online learning provides equal opportunities to all students regardless of their cultural backgrounds and cultural differences; hence, instructors have mostly not been able to recognize cultural implications for students' learning to design inclusive instructional strategies to meet the learning needs of diverse students in online education. What this paper adds This study, unlike earlier ones with a similar focus, explored online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP), specifically with regards to the design, preparation and integration of multicultural learning contents and resources in online education. This study employed Scott et al.'s (2015) culturally responsive computing theory as a lens to connect students' prior learning experiences, knowledge, interests, strengths and weaknesses as a way to draw instructors' attention to how best diverse students can be aided to be innovative and succeed in the face of cross-cultural challenges they face studying online. The study also contributes to the instructors' understanding of culturally responsive pedagogical principles in online spaces that recognize global identities and cultural experiences to meet the needs of diverse students in an online learning environment. Implications for practice and/or policy Instructors must develop online courses with the focus to bridge students' geographical and cultural backgrounds so that students will have the opportunity to share and connect with peers in online classrooms for effective collaboration and communication. Institutions that offer online education must make concerted efforts to provide continuous professional development opportunities for instructors of online courses on impacts of culture/diversity in the online classroom, and strategies for creating conducive online learning environments that value cultural differences, and social/educational experiences in ways that support students' learning. Institutions and stakeholders, through policy initiatives, should make frantic efforts to afford instructors with comprehensive knowledge and understanding of CRP in online learning to avoid the assumption that students in online courses share similar learning characteristics and bring to the online learning the same experiences and cultural backgrounds. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.",2023,,British Journal of Educational Technology,54,4,878-897,,10.1111/bjet.13299,,#158,Kumi-Yeboah 2023,"",""

In this study, a robust database was mined, created, and analyzed to assess the faculty compositions of 142 Earth Science departments in 39 countries across Africa. The data were collected from verifiable online resources focusing on ranks and gender ratios within each department. The studied earth science departments cut across universities in northern, southern, central, eastern, and western Africa. Our data revealed that female faculty members are predominantly underrepresented in most of the departments documented and are markedly uncommon in senior positions such as Professors, associate Professors, and senior researchers compared to their male counterparts. On the contrary, female faculty members are predominant in the lower cadres, such as lecturers, teaching, and graduate assistants. The observed male to female ratio is 4:1. At the base of this gender gap is the lower enrolment of female students in Earth Science courses from undergraudate to graduate studies. To achieve gender equality in Earth Science faculty composition in Africa, we recommend increasing female students' enrollment, mentoring, awareness, timely promotion of accomplished female researchers, and formulation of enabling government policies. More work-related policies that guarantee work-life balance for female earth science academic professionals should be formulated to attract and retain more women into Earth Sciences careers.

"Role of mentorship, career conceptualization, and leadership in developing women's physics identity and belonging","Rosenberg, J.L.; Holincheck, N.; Fernandez, K.; Dreyfus, B.W.; Wardere, F.; Stehle, S.; Butler, T.N.","The percentage of women receiving bachelor's degrees in physics (25%) in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from 2 institutions: a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, consistent with the existing literature, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people. While the data on how career conceptualization contributed to the building of identity is limited, there are some connections to recognition and competence, and it will be an interesting avenue of future exploration.",2024,/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,20,1,010114 (10 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.010114,,#160,Rosenberg 2024,"",""

These identified students were invited to attend weekly mathematical workshops, with a positive correlation between attendance and attainment and females more likely to attend. The CS students were satisfied with having the mathematical workshops delivered by student mentors.

Navigating the academic ladder as an early career researcher in earth and environmental sciences,"Alderson, Danielle; Clarke, Lucy; Schillereff, Daniel; Shuttleworth, Emma","There is growing concern in Higher Education around job security, work–life balance and inequalities, and early career researchers (ECRs) must make difficult trade-offs and life choices. Literature confirms that women navigating academia face additional challenges compared to their male counterparts. Few studies connected contractual circumstances, employment priorities and their impacts on the life choices of individual academics. We report results from a survey exploring the experiences of 37 ECRs who completed PhDs in the United Kingdom (UK) navigating the academic ladder in geomorphology and earth/environmental science, and contextualize these findings by drawing on personal experiences and wider literature. We find evidence of multi-directional pressures that have materially negative effects on individuals' life choices, including concern that academic employment is a barrier to living where and with whom one may want to. The level of precarity amongst survey respondents is stark in terms of number of years they have held fixed-term contracts (maximum 10 years), the number of individual contracts held (maximum 14) and number of different institutions worked at (maximum six). Women respondents were less prepared to be employed on precarious contracts and put more emphasis on job security when applying for academic posts, with men being generally more satisfied by financial aspects of university employment; which will amplify the leaky pipeline and gender gaps at more senior levels. We also find that perceived institutional prestige was a surprisingly low priority for the majority of respondents, and there were notable divergences between career advice given by more senior colleagues and the priorities of ECRs seeking guidance. We put forward a set of key considerations: improving policies on parental leave and flexible working; formalizing and improving mentorship; more considerate recruitment procedures; reducing contract precarity; and, transparency on pay and promotion. We believe these are within the scope of action by departments, laboratories and research groups. © 2022 The Authors.

Negotiating mentoring relationships and support for Black and Brown early-career faculty,"King, N.S.; Upadhyay, B.","In this essay, we share historical and structural components of mentoring within institutions of higher education and grapple with technical and moral obligations of support. We argue for more humanizing approaches that embed personal, social, and cultural aspects of mentoring, and seek to disrupt the purposes of mentoring, and for whom? Using a critical approach, we promote justice-oriented and equity-driven models of mentoring that account for excessive teaching loads and service commitments for faculty at minority-serving institutions and Black and Brown faculty at predominantly White institutions. Current promotion and tenure publish or perish models neglect the intellectual and scholarly contributions made through teaching and service and therefore hold the same level of expectations for engagement in and dissemination of research. We share our own stories as Faculty of Color navigating institutional structures during the promotion and tenure process, while also negotiating incongruent cultures of our personal and professional lives. Furthermore, we address the need for mentoring and networking within exclusionary spaces to support the productivity and critical research agendas of Black and Brown faculty that often challenge the white heteronormative cultures of our institutions, professional organizations, peer-reviewed journals, and prestigious funding mechanisms. Implications of this essay include an acknowledgment of oppressive systems that early-career Black and Brown faculty often navigate and a call for diverse mentoring programs and supports that conform with and validate our lives and needs. Furthermore, we provide recommendations on evidence-based resources and approaches that are available to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics faculty and science educators. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,/,Science Education,,,1149-71,,10.1002/sce.21755,,#167,King 2022,"",""

A survey was designed and tested accordingly, and four factors that contribute to students' academic well-being were identified to inspire the improvement of a future course and curriculum design. Background: Prior research has pointed out that students' academic well-being has a significant impact on their persistence in their current study, learning experience, academic achievement, and competence development. However, limited studies have explored first-year engineering students' academic well-being and supportive factors in the field of engineering higher education. To support engineering students to become agentic professionals, it is meaningful to pay close attention to their academic well-being and help them to become purposeful learners at an early stage of their professional development. Research Question: 1) How can an instrument be developed and validated to characterize the sources of students' academic well-being in a project-based learning approaches (PBL) context? 2) What sources could foster students' academic well-being in a PBL context? Are there significant differences in age, gender, and discipline as a function of sources of academic well-being? Methodology: With the guidance of the conceptual framework with the domains of internal and external sources, a survey was designed based on a literature review and conducted in a PBL environment. The survey's content validity, construct validity, and reliability were tested using expert review, a pilot study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Cronbach's alpha.

This study utilized a concurrent quasi-mixed design (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006), to investigate changes in the safety perceptions of educators' from 21 school districts. Pre- and post-survey ratings were mixed with content analyses from open-ended survey questions and accident report forms. The findings suggested that the PD experience had a significant influence on participants' safety perceptions; however, there were no significant differences according to certification areas. The analyses also revealed female participants' reported significantly greater safety self-efficacy gains than males. Additionally, 82% of the sample indicated the PD positively influenced their makerspace and integrated STEM safety knowledge. The findings indicate that high-quality safety PD can significantly influence educators' perceptions (especially females) about safer integrated STEM teaching and learning in makerspaces.

An Intelligent Biology Classroom Model Integrating Vocational Education Resource Banks for Skill Certification in Biotechnology Training,"Li, Qiao","This study explores an innovative teaching model for biology education that integrates vocational training and skill certification, aligning with the needs of the biotechnology industry. The research focuses on the development and implementation of an ""intelligent biology classroom"" combining post-course competition and certificate-based teaching with vocational education resource banks. This approach emphasizes aligning biology curricula in higher vocational colleges with industry standards to enhance professional competency in biotechnology training. To actively promote the integration of vocational resource banks into biology education, this study introduces an intelligent teaching framework that leverages digital tools for resource management, curriculum delivery, and skill assessment. Empirical analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this model in enhancing biology education outcomes. Results indicate that the resource bank-based teaching approach significantly outperformed traditional methods in metrics such as basic biological knowledge (85.1 ± 11.9), species analysis (23.1 ± 5.4), and experimental design (7.9 ± 1.6). Furthermore, attributes such as ecological civilization literacy, gender, class attributes, and home location demonstrated significant differences, with P-values less than 0, suggesting the comprehensive impact of this teaching model on student learning outcomes. By integrating vocational education resource banks with biology teaching, this model strengthens the connection between classroom learning and industry-relevant skills, promoting ecological literacy, critical thinking, and professional development. This approach not only enhances the quality of biology education but also prepares students for the demands of the biotechnology workforce, contributing to improved talent cultivation and social service capacity in higher vocational education. This research highlights the potential of combining intelligent classroom models and vocational resource banks to transform biology education, ensuring alignment with the evolving needs of the biotechnology sector and fostering innovation in educational practices. © 2024, Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.

Graduate Student Women's Perceptions of Faculty Careers: The Critical Role of Departmental Values and Support in Career Choice,"Howe, Morgan E.; Kim, Melony M.; Pazicni, Samuel","While the number of women in undergraduate and graduate chemistry programs has increased in recent years, women remain under-represented and excluded in the ranks of faculty in chemistry higher education. This marginalization results from not only fewer women being offered faculty positions but also fewer women applying for these positions. To investigate the reasons why faculty positions are causing so many women to turn elsewhere for employment, a survey was designed based on the literature themes surrounding women's career choices, interviews with the current graduate student women in chemistry programs, and our previous work. The survey was grounded in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), and data were analyzed through a QuantCrit lens. Despite the existing literature focusing on the impact of having children on women's career decisions, the desire to have children did not appear among either the top priorities or the most important factors in predicting whether any of the 130 survey respondents were interested in a faculty career. Instead, faculty career interest was related to themes of overwork, high expectations from departments, and expected department emphasis on research despite an individual's interest in teaching and mentoring. Furthermore, women expressed a strong interest in maintaining work-life balance but low expectations for their ability to obtain a position that would allow it. They also reported a desire to work for a department that values mental health and diversity and supports its community members but similarly low expectations for their ability to find a department that shares these values. These themes suggest that chemistry departments must make fundamental changes regarding what is tangibly valued and rewarded within their systems if they wish to reduce the exclusion of women in faculty positions. © 2022 The Authors.

Understanding professional skills in engineering education: A phenomenographic study of faculty conceptions,"Beagon, Una; Bowe, Brian","Background: Globalization and socially complex problems will greatly affect the way engineers work in the future. Therefore, efforts to transform engineering education must focus on professional skills and engagement of faculty as key change agents. Purpose/Hypotheses: For engineering programs to address the needs of society, graduates must have the skills to tackle future challenges. Transformation will only be successful if faculty fully engage in all curriculum design aspects; however, little is known about how faculty view professional skills. This understanding is critical if we wish to support and encourage their participation in the transformation effort. This novel study reveals the qualitatively different ways faculty conceptualize professional skills. Design/Method: Phenomenography was selected as the most appropriate method to showcase the variations in faculty conceptions. The study selected 19 interview participants from 273 responses to an online survey. Results: Faculty revealed their conceptions of professional skills in six ways: communication skills, technical skills, enabling skills, a combination of skills, interpersonal behaviors, and acting professionally. Conclusions: Findings revealed a tension between technical and nontechnical skills. The study highlights that engineering education must focus on behaviors and interactions between people rather than technical skills alone. Further, there was a gendered difference in conceptions between women and men with women more likely to consider professional skills to be inclusive of behavioral aspects. The findings can help create future strategies for engineering education and can be used as a reflective tool for engineering faculty in efforts to transform engineering education. © 2023 The Authors.

Gender disparities in research fields in Russia: dissertation authors and their mentors,"Chechik, E.","This study examines gender disparities in research fields as measured by scientific output in dissertations at two levels within the Russian academic system: PhD and the more advanced Doctor of Science (DS). The data for this study were extracted from over 250,000 dissertations spanning from 2005 to 2016. The chosen data source offers several advantages over bibliometric data for the purpose of this study: (a) it provides representative data, including the Social Sciences and Humanities and STEM fields; (b) gender disambiguation is straightforward due to the gendered nature of Russian patronyms; (c) it allows for easier attribution of text, as there is no need to attribute it to the first author in multi-authored publications; (d) it provides insights into the career stage by differentiating between PhD and DS authors, as well as between PhD and DS mentors. The results of this study reveal a gender imbalance across research fields and academic career levels. Furthermore, our observations indicate that male mentors more frequently collaborate with male authors, and female mentors with female authors, exceeding what would be expected by random chance. This gender homophily is evident in most research fields. While the results largely confirm findings from studies conducted in other countries, the four advantages mentioned above make this study an essential extension of studies based on bibliometric data.

A dataset of mentorship in bioscience with semantic and demographic estimations,"Ke, Q.; Liang, L.; Ding, Y.; David, S.V.; Acuna, D.E.","Mentorship in science is crucial for topic choice, career decisions, and the success of mentees and mentors. Typically, researchers who study mentorship use article co-authorship and doctoral dissertation datasets. However, available datasets of this type focus on narrow selections of fields and miss out on early career and non-publication-related interactions. Here, we describe Mentorship, a crowdsourced dataset of 743176 mentorship relationships among 738989 scientists primarily in biosciences that avoids these shortcomings. Our dataset enriches the Academic Family Tree project by adding publication data from the Microsoft Academic Graph and ""semantic"" representations of research using deep learning content analysis.

"Towards a more inclusive future: a comprehensive assessment of gender diversity in nuclear medicine education, training and workforce","Brink, A.; Israel, O.; Nadel, H.; Arevalo-Pardo, M.; Kalinchuk, O.; Estrada-Lobato, E.; Naydenova, M.; Drace, M.; Paez, D.","The field of nuclear medicine has undergone remarkable advances, particularly with the introduction of new devices, radionuclides for imaging and therapy, new clinical applications, and emergence of medical evidence. As this dynamic field continues its rapid expansion, there is an urgent need to increase the number of well-trained professionals globally. Consequently, advocating for nuclear medicine as a thriving field of study and work for women becomes paramount in ensuring the establishment of a robust workforce capable of meeting the growing demands. True gender equality will only be achieved when there is equal representation across the spectrum of the nuclear medicine professions, including nuclear medicine technologists, radiopharmacists, radiochemist, medical physicists, nuclear medicine physicians, administrators, academics, and leaders. Currently, the workforce exhibits an imbalance, with females predominating among nuclear medicine technologists, while the number of female physicians, and those in leadership positions remains comparatively lower. There are various factors which contribute to the existing inequities. Societal expectations often impose traditional gender roles that somehow discourage women from pursuing a career in the science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including nuclear medicine. Additionally, prevailing unequal work conditions and gender biases within the workplace can create barriers that hinder women's professional growth and development. Ways of addressing inequalities includes ensuring female participation at all levels of education and training and promoting the field at undergraduate level in medical school. Mentorship programs have demonstrated great success in guiding and supporting women at various stages of their careers. Therefore, there is a need for their expansion and enhancement. Furthermore, female role models play a pivotal role in shattering gender stereotypes and inspiring other women to pursue careers in nuclear medicine and its related fields. By addressing the existing imbalances and fostering an environment that actively encourages and supports women, we can harness the full potential of all professionals, thus ensuring the ongoing progress and advancement of nuclear medicine.

"Tracing the career trajectories of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) women leaders","Hickey, Paul J.; Cui, Qingbin","This study delves into the professional trajectories of 20 women leaders Vice President (VP) and above in the U.S. Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. These accomplished women, carefully selected from Engineering News Record’s (ENR's) Top 400 firms, shared their personal stories, discussing both triumphs and challenges influencing their journey to senior corporate positions. This collection of experiences provides valuable insights to identify the root causes of women’s underrepresentation in the industry. Moreover, this investigation aims to create a career roadmap that supports early and mid-career women in their pursuit of success within AEC. Success factors contributing to these women’s rise include a supportive partner, receiving early mentoring and possessing a genuine passion for their projects. Companies seeking to stand out and benefit from innovative outcomes that diversity offers should consider implementing diversity programs and fostering the growth of women throughout their careers. This may involve actively recruiting young women and providing funding for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and scholarships for pre-college girls.

Mentoring across differences in science education: Applying a brokering framework,"Haverly, C.; Brown, B.A.","Mentoring relationships in academia have traditionally been described as a dyad between a mentor and a mentee. The mentor provides the mentee with both technical and psychosocial support to move toward obtaining their Ph.D. or gaining tenure and promotion. While there is an embedded assumption that mentoring is best suited when people of common background support each other, scholars must consider the impact of mentoring across differences. Given the lack of diversity among senior faculty members in science education, and given the increasing diversity represented among graduate students and early career scholars in science education, inevitably mentoring relationships will be formed across differences in identities (race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability). In our essay, we focus on two focal points: we explore those aspects of mentoring relationships that research suggests are critical to the success of relationships built across differences, foregrounding lessons science education researchers can take from this literature and arguing that it is too much to expect one individual mentor to provide to any given mentee. Next, we propose a brokering framework, leveraging technological advances, to work toward more transformative mentoring outcomes at scale, particularly when mentoring across differences. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,/,Science Education,,,1135-48,,10.1002/sce.21720,,#180,Haverly 2022,"",""

Counterspaces for women of color in STEM higher education: Marginal and central spaces for persistence and success,"Ong, Maria; Smith, Janet M.; Ko, Lily T.","Counterspaces in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are often considered ""safe spaces"" at the margins for groups outside the mainstream of STEM education. The prevailing culture and structural manifestations in STEM have traditionally privileged norms of success that favor competitive, individualistic, and solitary practices—norms associated with White male scientists. This privilege extends to structures that govern learning and mark progress in STEM education that have marginalized groups that do not reflect the gender, race, or ethnicity conventionally associated with STEM mainstream success, thus necessitating spaces in which the effects of marginalization may be countered. Women of color is one such marginalized group. This article explores the struggles of women of color that threaten their persistence in STEM education and how those struggles lead them to search out or create counterspaces. It also examines the ways that counterspaces operate for women of color in STEM higher education, particularly how they function as havens from isolation and microaggressions. Using a framework of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and intersectionality theory and drawing on interview data from 39 women of color about their STEM higher education experiences, we describe five ways in which counterspaces operate: in peer-to-peer relationships; mentoring relationships; national STEM diversity conferences; STEM and non-STEM campus student groups; and STEM departments. Whereas most research has discussed counterspaces as racially or ethnically homogeneous social groups of peers at the margins, our research found that counterspaces vary in terms of the race/ethnicity, gender, and power levels of participants. We found that counterspaces can be physical settings, as well as conceptual and ideological. Additionally, we identified counterspaces both at the margins and at the center of STEM departments. Thus, our research expands the existing understanding of the types and functions of counterspaces and broadens the definition of what locations can be and should be considered counterspaces. © 2017 The Authors.

While progress has been made to support women in the field, especially at biomechanics society conferences, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated professional isolation. The International Women in Biomechanics (IWB) community started in July 2020 with the mission of fostering an environment for women and other under-represented genders in biomechanics to gain year-round support, visibility, and allyship. Nearly 700 biomechanists have joined the IWB community from over 300 universities/organizations and 33 countries. Our community ranges in career stages and professions and interacts through a forum-style platform, teleconference meetings, and social media. In 2021, we conducted a survey to identify the needs, concerns, and issues faced by individuals in the IWB community. We received 144 responses from members in 16 countries. Our survey revealed three primary needs for women in biomechanics: supportive working environments, career planning support, and addressing workplace gender bias. These results, in conjunction with scientific evidence on workforce gender bias, helped us identify three key areas to meet our mission: Member Support, Community Outreach, and Empowering Allyship. Several levels of support are required in these three areas to ensure a lasting, positive, and sustainable impact on gender equity in biomechanics. We conclude by providing our perspectives on an evidence-based call to action to continue addressing gender bias and inequity at the individual, institutional, and scientific society levels. These actions can collectively enhance our allyship for women in the field of biomechanics. © 2022",2023,,Journal of Biomechanics,146,,,,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111419,,#183,Ebrahimi 2023,"",""
Listen to Black Women: The Power of Black Women’s Collective Sexual Wisdom About Strategies to Promote Sexual Pleasure and Reduce Sexual Pain,"","IntroductionBlack women’s collective wisdom has informed Black women’s sexual development for decades. Yet, empirical collective wisdom regarding what is needed to reduce their experiences of sexual pain and enhance sexual pleasure has been omitted. This study fills this gap by centering the voices of Black women living in the Southern region of the USA who have experienced sexual difficulties.MethodsWe used thematic analysis to find themes across n = 21 in-depth interviews with Black women living in the Southern USA who consented to participate in a mixed methods study focused on Black women’s experiences of sexual pain and pleasure. We interviewed participants between January and March 2021.ResultsThere were five main themes: 1) Talk that talk, 2) On my mama and big mama, 3) Take me to church, 4) Put yourself first, and 5) What about the men?ConclusionsFindings of this study reveal a common desire among Black women who have experienced sexual pain to have safe spaces to talk about sexual health through multigenerational sister circles and in churches. Heterosexual participants also stressed the importance of sexuality education opportunities for Black men.Policy ImplicationsIt is important to understand the systems of oppression that present obstacles to Black women’s sexual development and sexual health knowledge acquisition.

Having Reliable Support: A Prerequisite to Promote Sexual and Reproductive Health in Young Women with ADHD,"Wallin, Karin; Wallin-Lundell, Inger; Alehagen, Siw; Hanberger, Lena; Hultsjö, Sally","Living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may influence sexual behaviors and intimate relationships in young women, resulting in a higher risk of unwanted pregnancy, sexual victimization, and sexual dysfunction. To develop adequate support, the study aimed to describe conceptions of how to promote sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in young women with ADHD. A secondary analysis using phenomenography was performed on qualitative interview data exploring variations of support. The study involved 15 young women with ADHD, aged 15–29 years, and 16 health care professionals, with various professions, working in the fields of gynecology, youth health, and psychiatry. Having reliable support was conceptualized as fundamental for promoting SRH. Access to information concerning SRH and living with ADHD as well as early support from health care contributed to a reliable support enabling self-knowledge and management of sexual relationships. Trustful relationships in health care were perceived as important because of previous experiences of feeling misunderstood and criticized in life, making them feel comfortable discussing SRH. Clinical encounters with a clear structure were further perceived to make information more accessible and clinics that provided appropriate organizational conditions and collaborated with other clinics were described to enhance the availability of support. This study reveals the need for clinics to provide conditions that ensure SRH support is available, accessible, and free of stigmatization.

Intimacy Promotes Couples’ Sexual Well-Being on a Daily Basis and Over One Year: The Role of Positive Sexual Cues,"Bergeron, Sophie; Vaillancourt-Morel, Marie-Pier; Péloquin, Katherine; Rosen, Natalie O.","There is growing interest in identifying factors that promote sexual well-being in romantic relationships. One such factor is intimacy—a process involving self-disclosure and empathic response that is positively associated with sexuality outcomes. However, most work among community couples examined cross-sectional associations in mixed-sex/gender couples using a single sexual outcome, which may not capture daily variations in intimacy and different dimensions of sexual well-being among a diversity of unions over time. Additionally, potential mediating mechanisms of the intimacy-sexual well-being association, such as attention to positive sexual cues (i.e., sexual thoughts and feelings), have been neglected. Adopting daily diary and longitudinal designs, the present study examined whether greater intimacy was associated with higher levels of positive sexual cues and, in turn, higher sexual well-being (sexual desire, satisfaction and distress). A convenience sample of 211 couples (Mage = 30.2 years; SD = 8.3; 75 sexually diverse couples) completed a survey on days of sexual activity with their partner, over a 35-day period and 12 months later. Daily results showed that intimacy was related to greater attention to positive sexual cues for both partners, which in turn was associated with their greater sexual desire and satisfaction and lower sexual distress. Longitudinal results showed that a person’s greater daily intimacy was linked to their own greater sexual desire and satisfaction 12 months later via their own higher positive sexual cues, but not to their partner’s cues or well-being.

The present study aims to investigate the effect of a mobile app-based psychosexual intervention on enhancing help-seeking behavior of newly married women in Iran, Rasht, regarding their sexual health issues.MethodsThis study was a parallel randomized controlled trial, performed during December 25, 2021, to January 12, 2022, on 140 newly married women in Iran, Rasht. Data collection tools included a demographic data questionnaire, General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), Actual Help-Seeking Questionnaire (AHSQ), and the female sexual function index-short form (FSFI-6). The intervention group received psychosexual intervention using a mobile app, the HISSS App, while the control group received an unrelated intervention regarding menstruation hygiene using the Easy Period App. The intervention lasted 6 weeks, and the outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after, and 8 weeks after the intervention.ResultsA total of 119 participants successfully completed the study. The mean differences between groups for GHSQ and formal AHSQ immediately after the intervention were significant (10.49 [95% CI (8.33 to 12.65)], P < .001; (.57 [95% CI (.23 to .69)], P < .001). They remained significant after 8 weeks as well (11 [95% CI (8.02 to 13.99)], P < .001); (.69 [95% CI (.23 to 1.15)], P = .003) when compared to baseline.

Testosterone plays a crucial role in men’s health. Lower testosterone level is associated with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Testosterone replacement is beneficial or neutral to men’s cardiovascular health. Testosterone deficiency is associated with cardiovascular events. Testosterone supplementation to hypogonadal men improves libido, increases muscle strength, and enhances mood. We hypothesized that sex chromosomes (XX and XY) interaction with testosterone plays a role in arterial stiffening.MethodsWe used four core genotype male mice to understand the inherent contribution of sex hormones and sex chromosome complement in arterial stiffening. Age-matched mice were either gonadal intact or castrated at eight weeks plus an additional eight weeks to clear endogenous sex hormones. This was followed by assessing blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, echocardiography, and ex vivo passive vascular mechanics.ResultsArterial stiffening but not blood pressure was more significant in castrated than testes-intact mice independent of sex chromosome complement. Castrated mice showed a leftward shift in stress–strain curves and carotid wall thinning.

Allies as organizational change agents to promote equity and inclusion: a case study,"Li, Yun Ling; Evans, Karoline; Bond, Meg A","Purpose>The current case study investigated how intentional, systematic planning can help organizations harness the energy of these willing allies who may be motivated to support change. The focus of the study is the development of a peer-to-peer approach, involving “Equity Leaders (ELs),” that was part of a larger, multi-level organization change initiative that addressed personal, interpersonal and structural considerations at a mid-sized public university in northeastern USA.Design/methodology/approach>The authors used multiple methods to collect data for the current study, including observations and interviews. Over the course of four years, the authors attended more than 50 EL meetings. In these meetings, the authors took notes regarding ELs' discussions on workshop development and planning, debates on workshop substances and ELs' personal reflections on these workshops. Following the fourth year of the program, the first two authors invited all current ELs to participate in semi-structured, open-ended interviews about their experience.Findings>The case study shows that through careful planning, peer change can play multiple roles in pushing organizational changes. By embracing their formal responsibilities and yielding their informal power, change agents are able to cause radiating impact across as organizations. Organizations can also capitalize on the fact that employees are more likely to be engaged in the change effort when it is promoted by peers. Finally, the support and resources from the organizational leaders is important because these inputs not only legitimize change agents' roles but they also signify the importance of the actions.Research limitations/implications>This study has limitations. First, the authors recognize that this was a qualitative study grounded in a single context. Although the study explored a novel context for understanding change agents—a deliberately planned initiative targeting social norms through addressing subtle biases like microaggressions—the authors recognize that additional examination would be necessary to understand how implementation may work in different contexts or organization types. Second, the authors also acknowledge that the authors’ positionality, as females studying a change initiative targeting gendered and intersectional microaggressions, may have shaped the role as researchers.Originality/value>The findings underscore the notion that allies can serve as organized peer change agents to affect organizational culture.

"Women in Academia: Representation, Tenure, and Publication Patterns in the STEM and Social Sciences Fields","Krebsbach, Jennifer M","Women in the workplace experience inequity in their professional career options and in their upward mobility. One place this occurs frequently is in higher education. Whether it be their representation at various levels of professorship (wherein male full professors far outweigh the number of female full professors), the interactions with others on campus (especially regarding student expectations of professors), or the expectations that are placed upon them for success (over recruitment for teaching and service to the university; under recruitment for research opportunities and grants), women in academia are finding barriers that are preventing them from succeeding at a similar rate or frequency to that of their male counterparts. This review examines women's experiences in academia, specifically those items related to promotion. The author describes the individual aspects of tenure (student evaluations, service to the university, and research) and the barriers that women have reported experiencing within each category, the previous data regarding the inequity between male and female professors, and how publication impacts promotion. Inequity exists in each of the three primary areas of the tenure process, but one area that has shown the greatest impact is within academic publication. The author reviewed the literature across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and social sciences regarding 1) the role of sex in publication (from both the authors of submissions and the editors-in-chief of the journal), and 2) discrepancies in acceptance rates.

The tenure clock in the settler academy relies on labor performed by those positioned outside of its time—such as those in temporary or semi-temporary positions, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Our motivation in tracing these logics and formulating feminist strategies to undo them stems directly from observing ""faculty with disabilities"" at our university struggling against the tenure clock; as well as seemingly abled women faculty, faculty of color, and contingent faculty, who have strained against the academic clock and ended up debilitated in the process. We articulate ways in which more collaborative understandings of university culture and knowledge production might serve to challenge the peculiar temporalities produced by the tenure clock.

"Tobacco Farming, Addiction, Promotion of Gender Equality, Well-being and Monopoly of the Indian Market","Singha, Ranjit; Kanna, S Yogesh","Women's land rights are still suppressed in India because men hold most of the land, and men decide what crops to grow. Tobacco use and farming are both detriments to one's health. It causes cancer, and cancer treatment is unavailable in the majority of India's remote areas. On the other hand, tobacco is grown in remote regions of India, and cancer hospitals are concentrated in major cities. There are eight states in India's north-eastern region, but only one cancer treatment facility in Guwahati, Assam. There is a need for new cancer hospitals in the north-eastern part of the country, where there is just one cancer hospital for eight states. Mindfulness training and tobacco harmful effects awareness education should be integrated into the educational curriculum and community centres. The school curriculum should include more mindfulness and psychoeducation about tobacco's detrimental effects. The pandemic situation in India and elsewhere make any community-based response difficult right now. Some parts of India, such as A&I Island, the North-Eastern region of India, and J&K, lack high-speed internet connectivity; therefore, radio, television, audio CDs, audio files, recorded videos, reading materials, and cell phones may be the best ways to reach out. Internetbased outreach is another option. A non-governmental organisation (NGO) or other organisation would be required to create regional language reading material, audio files, and video files. Given the global pandemic crisis, such programmes must be put in place as soon as possible.

The Effect of Sexual Health Promotion Package on Sexual Life in Women with Multiple Sclerosis: Designed Based on the Results of a Mixed Method Study,"Ghasemi Vida; Nabavi, Seyed Massood; Simbar Masoumeh; Ozgoli Giti; Alavi, Majd Hamid; Mirshafaei, Maryam Sadat; Mohammadsoori Behzad; Banaei Mojdeh","Sexual dysfunction (SD) is one of the most prevalent problems in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) that can have a negative impact on their sexual quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sexual health promotion package on SD and quality of sexual life in women with MS. This randomized clinical trial, was performed on 72 married women aged between 18 and 50-years-old with MS and SD presenting to the Iranian MS Society in Tehran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n = 36) and control (n = 36). The content of the sexual health promotion package was designed and prepared based on the results of an explanatory sequential mixed method study and review of literature and was performed in six sessions for the intervention group, while the control group received its routine care. For evaluating the effect of the intervention on SD and quality of sexual life, Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire19 (MSISQ-19) and Sexual Quality Of Life-Female (SQOL-F) were respectively completed before, immediately, one month and two months after the intervention. Based on the type of information, Mann–Whitney, Chi-square, independent t-test and repeated measures ANOVA test were performed using SPSS version 25. The results of repeated measures ANOVA test between the two groups during the four periods of time, showed that a significant decrease in the total MSISQ-19 score as well as primary, secondary and tertiary SD score and a significant increase in the quality of sexual life score in the intervention group (p < 0.001). By contrast, no significant difference was observed in the control group in terms of the total SD score (p = 0.336), primary SD (P = 0.058), secondary SD (P = 0.075), tertiary SD (P = 0.554) and quality of sexual life (P = 0.105). The results of this study showed the effectiveness of a need-based and evidence-based sexual health promotion package designed based on the results of a mixed method study on SD and quality of sexual life of Iranian women with MS. Given the significant role of sexual life in MS patients, it is strongly recommended to consider and implement training and counseling sessions based on a comprehensive, complete and multidimensional content which includes all the factors affecting the sexual health of these patients.",2022,,Sexuality and Disability,40,1,57-75,2645318295,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11195-021-09697-w,,#195,GhasemiVida 2022,"",""
Artificial intelligence: A rapid case for advancement in the personalization of Gynaecology/Obstetric and Mental Health care,"Delanerolle Gayathri; Yang Xuzhi; Shetty Suchith; Raymont Vanessa; Shetty Ashish; Phiri, Peter; Hapangama, Dharani K; Tempest, Nicola; Majumder Kingshuk; Shi, Jian Qing","To evaluate and holistically treat the mental health sequelae and potential psychiatric comorbidities associated with obstetric and gynaecological conditions, it is important to optimize patient care, ensure efficient use of limited resources and improve health-economic models. Artificial intelligence applications could assist in achieving the above. The World Health Organization and global healthcare systems have already recognized the use of artificial intelligence technologies to address ‘system gaps’ and automate some of the more cumbersome tasks to optimize clinical services and reduce health inequalities. Currently, both mental health and obstetric and gynaecological services independently use artificial intelligence applications. Thus, suitable solutions are shared between mental health and obstetric and gynaecological clinical practices, independent of one another. Although, to address complexities with some patients who may have often interchanging sequelae with mental health and obstetric and gynaecological illnesses, ‘holistically’ developed artificial intelligence applications could be useful. Therefore, we present a rapid review to understand the currently available artificial intelligence applications and research into multi-morbid conditions, including clinical trial-based validations. Most artificial intelligence applications are intrinsically data-driven tools, and their validation in healthcare can be challenging as they require large-scale clinical trials. Furthermore, most artificial intelligence applications use rate-limiting mock data sets, which restrict their applicability to a clinical population. Some researchers may fail to recognize the randomness in the data generating processes in clinical care from a statistical perspective with a potentially minimal representation of a population, limiting their applicability within a real-world setting. However, novel, innovative trial designs could pave the way to generate better data sets that are generalizable to the entire global population. A collaboration between artificial intelligence and statistical models could be developed and deployed with algorithmic and domain interpretability to achieve this. In addition, acquiring big data sets is vital to ensure these artificial intelligence applications provide the highest accuracy within a real-world setting, especially when used as part of a clinical diagnosis or treatment.",2021,,Women's Health,17,,,2613254026,https://doi.org/10.1177/17455065211018111,,#196,DelanerolleGayathri 2021,"",""
Promoting Men’s Health Equity,"Griffith, Derek M","Men’s health equity is an area of men’s health research and practice that combines the literature on men’s health with that of health equity. More research is needed that describes how to intervene to promote men’s health equity. This introduction to the American Journal of Men’s Health special collection on promoting men’s health equity was created to feature research that describes aspects of promising interventions that (a) are population-specific approaches that consider the unique biopsychosocial factors that affect the health of socially defined populations of men; or (b) use a comparative approach to close or eliminate gaps between socially defined groups of men and women and among socially meaningful groups of men that are unnecessary, avoidable, considered unfair and unjust, and yet are modifiable. The dozen papers from across the globe included in the special collection are grouped in three areas: conceptual approaches and reviews; formative research; and evaluation findings. The papers represent a diverse array of populations under the umbrella of men’s health and a range of strategies to improve men’s health from tobacco cessation to microfinance. The collection features a range of alternative masculinities that emerge from original research by the contributors that are used in novel ways in the interventions. This editorial argues that more qualitative research is needed to evaluate the intended and unintended findings from interventions.

The program objectives were to (a) increase knowledge and risk awareness of targeted conditions, (b) change health-care-seeking attitudes toward regular primary care among AA men, and (c) improve their lifestyle-related health behaviors by leveraging the influence of women in their lives. The community-engaged educational intervention targeted both men and women and included eight 90-min sessions per cohort. Topics included prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, health-care access, and healthy lifestyle. Sessions were both didactic and interactive. A pre-/post-intervention questionnaire assessed knowledge. Interviews were conducted with male participants and a focus group discussion (FGD) with women to assess program impact. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed for themes and recommendations. Major themes were—increased knowledge/awareness of risk associated with chronic conditions, change in health-care-seeking attitudes, increased self-efficacy to engage the health-care system, and lifestyle changes. Other impacts reported were building community/social support, a safe and enabling learning environment, and enhanced community health status overall. Recommendations included having extended, more in-depth sessions, targeting the younger generation, smaller cohort sizes, and more community-based health programming.

How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advancement of Scholars in STEM: Professors’ Biased Evaluations of Physics and Biology Post-Doctoral Candidates,"Eaton, Asia A; Saunders, Jessica F; Jacobson, Ryan K; West Keon","The current study examines how intersecting stereotypes about gender and race influence faculty perceptions of post-doctoral candidates in STEM fields in the United States. Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments.

Unclogging the pipeline: advancement to full professor in academic STEM,"Helga Van Miegroet; Glass, Christy; Ronda Roberts Callister; Sullivan, Kimberly","PurposeWomen remain underrepresented in academic STEM, especially at the highest ranks. While much attention has focused on early-career attrition, mid-career advancement is still largely understudied and undocumented. The purpose of this paper is to analyze gender differences in advancement to full professor within academic STEM at a mid-size public doctoral university in the western USA, before and after the National Science Foundation (NSF)-ADVANCE Program (2003–2008).Design/methodology/approachUsing faculty demographics and promotion data between 2008 and 2014, combined with faculty responses to two waves of a climate survey, the magnitude and longevity of the impact of ADVANCE on mid-career faculty advancement across gender is evaluated.FindingsThis study documents increased representation of women in all ranks within the STEM colleges, including that of full professor due to ADVANCE efforts. It also demonstrates the role of greater gender awareness and formalization of procedures in reducing the variability in the time as associate professor until promotion to full professor for all faculty members, while also shrinking gender disparities in career attainment. As a result of the codification of the post-tenure review timeline toward promotion, more recently hired faculty are promoted more swiftly and consistently, irrespective of gender. Post-ADVANCE, both male and female faculty members express a greater understanding of and confidence in the promotion process and no longer see it as either a hurdle or source of gender inequality in upward career mobility.Research limitations/implicationsWhile data were collected at a single university, demographics and career experiences by women mirror those at other research universities. This study shows that within a given institution-specific governance structure, long-lasting effects on faculty career trajectories can be achieved, by focusing efforts on creating greater transparency in expectations and necessary steps toward promotion, by reducing barriers to information flown, by standardizing and codifying the promotion process, and by actively engaging administrators as collaborators and change agents in the transformation process.Originality/valueThis study addresses mid-career dynamics and potential mechanisms that explain gender gaps in the promotion to full professor, a largely understudied aspect of gender disparities in career attainment within STEM.

Wage Disparities in Academia for Engineering Women of Color and the Limitations of Advocacy and Agency,"McGee, Ebony; Cox, Monica F; Main, Joyce B; Miles, Monica L; Hailu, Meseret F","The devaluation of women of Color (WoC) by way of gender discrimination and systemic racism is well documented. For WoC in engineering a chief cause is the observable wage gap. Women who identify as Asian, Black/African American, Latina/Chicana, Indigenous/Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Native Alaskan, and/or multiracial have reported stark wage disparities. In this paper, we offer a phenomenological study of how WoC engineering faculty across U.S. academic institutions describe the challenges and practices associated with wage disparities and how they navigate these disparities. This study, which is based on participant interviews, is guided by three research questions: (1) What do WoC engineering tenure-track faculty perceive about wage disparities based on their race and gender? (2) How do WoC faculty understand the institutional practices that contribute to wage disparities? and (3) How do WoC engineering faculty respond to and address wage disparities? Using structural racism and intersectionality as our guiding conceptual framework, we interviewed 32 self-identified WoC who identified structures and systems of institutional racism related to the maintenance of wage disparities. In terms of findings, we note that WoC have two primary strategies to respond to wage disparity: advocacy and agency. The experiences of WoC engineering faculty in our study highlight unsatisfying institutional responses, and thus WoC often rely on their own agency to advocate for themselves and to advocate for and mentor other WoC faculty. We found a few notable cases where men advocated for women to help close the wage gap. Our work reveals that pay inequity for WoC is often coupled with other forms of exclusion and marginalization. Reducing wage disparities in academia is critical to advancing diversity efforts and ensuring equitable support for WoC faculty.

The gap-closing estimand quantifies how much a gap (e.g., incomes by race) would close if we intervened to equalize a treatment (e.g., access to college). Drawing on causal decomposition analyses, this type of research question yields several benefits. First, gap-closing estimands place categories like race in a causal framework without making them play the role of the treatment (which is philosophically fraught for non-manipulable variables). Second, gap-closing estimands empower researchers to study disparities using new statistical and machine learning estimators designed for causal effects. Third, gap-closing estimands can directly inform policy: if we sampled from the population and actually changed treatment assignments, how much could we close gaps in outcomes? I provide open-source software (the R package gapclosing) to support these methods.",2024,,Sociological Methods & Research,53,2,507-570,3075709641; EJ1422494,https://doi.org/10.1177/00491241211055769,,#214,Lundberg 2024,"",""
Exploring Faculty Perspectives on Implementing Differentiated Instruction,Rahmeh Abbaas B.

Gender Patterns in Engineering PhD Teaching Assistant Evaluations Corroborate Role Congruity Theory,"Evans, C A; Adler, K; Yucalan, D; Schneider-Bentley, L M","The body of work regarding gender bias in academia shows that female instructors are often rated lower by students than their male counterparts. Mechanisms are complex and intersectional and often associated with role congruity theory. Little research has examined parallel patterns in graduate teaching assistant (TA) evaluations. In research institutions, TAs make up a large portion of teaching teams. Identifying bias and working to remove it is critical to shifting the already-well-documented gender imbalance in higher education. To evaluate gender-associated perceptions of graduate TAs' teaching skills, we analyzed Likert-scale, mid-semester survey data using ordinal logistic regression models for PhD TAs in five (pre-COVID) semesters in the College of Engineering at Cornell University, a large R1 institution in the United States. We also regressed scores for each survey question against the overall TA quality rating for male- and female-identifying TAs to compare the strength of those relationships and explore potential differences in student expectations associated with gender roles. A subset of narrative comment data were coded into themes, analyzed, and triangulated with other observed patterns. Male TAs had a higher likelihood of receiving a better rating than female TAs for all survey questions in which students rated performance. Statistical evidence of different slopes of relationships between particular questions and overall TA quality rating suggested that female and male TAs were ""valued"" more for behaviors/attributes congruent with roles ascribed to that gender in broader society. Female TAs received a higher proportion of positive comments for communication skills and more comments regarding supportiveness than male TAs. Males received more comments about their overall value as TAs, however all comments regarding overall quality as TAs were positive regardless of gender. The amount and proportion of comments that were positive or negative for knowledge, enthusiasm, preparedness or fairness were the same for male and female TAs. Gender-based disparity is occurring in TA evaluations and aligns with patterns observed in research on teaching evaluations for faculty. Correlation between overall TA ratings and scores for specific survey questions and narrative responses indicate that role congruity influences traits that students perceive as important and positive in TAs of different genders.",2024,,International Journal of STEM Education,11,,,3040236745; EJ1409738,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-023-00460-5,,#216,Evans 2024,"",""

"Queering the Glass Ceiling: Alpha Females, Cyborgs, and the Non-Tenure Track in Science","Doerr, Katherine","This inquiry into the nature of feminist solidarity in the academic sciences is guided by the intra-activity of gendered bodies in teaching-intensive faculty positions. It uses diffractive methodology to examine how response-able research practice can account for enactment of social discourse through agential cuts. Over the course of a two-year ethnography in a university with high research activity, gender performativity in the contested space of feminized teaching and masculine science was analysed. This article aims to make visible how researcher subjectivities entangle with data collection. Results show how specific agential cuts -- alpha female, silencing, less-than-person, squashing passion, and staying to get tenure -- illuminate a unique diffractive pattern. The pattern troubles structural notions of feminist solidarity, as ethnographic participants marginalized by institutional hierarchies survive by queering it. Furthermore, the inquiry gestures towards a humble, local, and tentative contribution to post-human theorizing on 'queering the glass ceiling'.",2023,,Gender and Education,35,6-7,537-551,2890046290; EJ1398338,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540253.2023.2231518,,#220,Doerr 2023,"",""

The findings reveal multiple intersecting barriers to women's full engagement, inclusion, support and career success in higher education, despite the implementation of organization-based gender equity plans, and institutional inter/national recognition for advancing equity. Most axes of de/privilege that are based along lines of gender, race, ethnicity and religion are enacted as everyday sexism that resist gender equality policy. Moreover, our findings suggest that 'place' is a constitutive element of intersectional dis/advantage, not merely a context within which compounded barriers to inclusion and advancement may exist. In addition, the findings demonstrate that whilst inter-categorical intersectionality is based on the notion that all social categories (such as age, race and gender) are equally salient, the degree of importance of any category will likely depend on location or context of the phenomena being examined.

This study used the descriptive-comparative-associational method using a content-validated and reliability-tested questionnaire. The frequency and percentage technique, weighted mean, Chi-Square, and Anova Test of Variance were used in the data treatment. Findings revealed that ELT teachers were predominantly females with 73.97%, CHED, 80.21%, DepEd, and 71.43% TESDA along age groups of early and mid-30s and 46 years above. They served the agencies for less than 10 years, mostly married. Professionally, these teachers were still pursuing post-graduate education and attending training. Along with appraisals on their professional and work responsibility, ELT Trifocal teachers very evidently performed their professional and work responsibilities; on the delivery system, respondents conveyed the mastery and application of theoretical and pedagogical knowledge; on their communicative competencies, they were classified as experts. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference among ELT teachers' appraisal in the three systems (F--value 2.21< t-value 3.35; 5% level of significance). It follows that Philippine education has maintained an undeviating quality of ELT teachers regardless of which system of education they belong. The result showed no variations in ELT competencies despite differences in modalities, urgencies, and the attainment of quality education. Findings also unveiled that the ELT teachers' appraisal and integration of ICT to language teaching are directly associated with their age, sex and civil status, and educational attainment.

Objective: This study addresses the factors that contribute to persistence in computing majors among undergraduate students who took introductory computing courses during the first two years of college. Method: Student survey data from 15 research universities in the United States were used to explore differences in persistence patterns by students' gender and racial/ethnic identities. Further, we used logistic regression to examine factors that promote persistence in computing majors, with attention to conditional effects by gender and race/ethnicity. Findings: Results show that women are less likely than men to persist in computing majors two years following completion of the introductory CS course. Findings suggest that proximal socialization experiences, specifically those related to students' self-confidence, sense of fit, and in-class experiences, are important to student persistence in computing fields. Implications: The results suggest that peer experiences in computing are central to student persistence in the major. Hence, computing departments can act on these findings by strengthening the community within their majors and fostering positive peer interactions among students.

Teachers' Self-Efficacy Beliefs Regarding Out-of-School Learning Activities,"Demir, Engin; Çetin, Filiz","Learning activities employed in out-of-school learning activities (OOSLA) provide students with a different learning experience while enabling teachers to discover, implement, and evaluate different teaching approaches. This study intends to investigate the self-efficacy beliefs levels of teachers as regards OOSLA and whether these self-efficacy levels differ significantly depending on their gender, graduated faculty, educational status, seniority, and department graduated from. It adopts the descriptive survey design. The sample is composed of 308 teachers. The data were collected utilizing the ""Teachers' Self-Efficacy Beliefs Toward Out-of-School Learning Activities Scale''. Parametric test statistics were used in data analysis. The results revealed that teachers had a high level of self-efficacy beliefs regarding OOSLA and that gender was not a determinant of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It was also found that the participants who completed graduate studies had firmer self-efficacy beliefs than those who did not. The teachers with 21 years and above of teaching experience had higher self-efficacy levels than those with 6-10 and 11-15 years of teaching experience. On the other hand, graduates of mathematics and science education departments had lower self-efficacy levels than primary education, Turkish education, and social science education departments. Finally, researchers recommend encouraging pursuing graduate studies, collaborating with experienced teachers, eliminating institutional obstacles to out-of-school activities, and supporting teachers in increasing their self-efficacy regarding out-of-school learning activities.

The Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP): 15 Years Promoting Social Mobility through Academic Achievement,"Landim, Claudio; FitzSimons, Gail E.","In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created by the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18 million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals are distributed to public school students. In the following year these students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of boys.

Hispanic students with a Hispanic faculty mentor reported engaging in more coauthoring opportunities than peers with non-Hispanic mentors. Among those with higher contact frequency, students with same-gender mentors had higher levels of relationship satisfaction than peers with different-gender mentors; however, there were no differences among those with low contact frequency.

Predicting Implementation of Active Learning by Tenure-Track Teaching Faculty Using Robust Cluster Analysis,"Denaro, Kameryn; Kranzfelder, Petra; Owens, Melinda T.; Sato, Brian; Zuckerman, Austin L.; Hardesty, Rebecca A.; Signorini, Adriana; Aebersold, Andrea; Verma, Mayank; Lo, Stanley M.","Background: The University of California system has a novel tenure-track education-focused faculty position called Lecturer with Security of Employment (working titles: Teaching Professor or Professor of Teaching). We focus on the potential difference in implementation of active-learning strategies by faculty type, including tenure-track education-focused faculty, tenure-track research-focused faculty, and non-tenure-track lecturers. In addition, we consider other instructor characteristics (faculty rank, years of teaching, and gender) and classroom characteristics (campus, discipline, and class size). We use a robust clustering algorithm to determine the number of clusters, identify instructors using active learning, and to understand the instructor and classroom characteristics in relation to the adoption of active-learning strategies. Results: We observed 125 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate courses at three University of California campuses using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM to examine active-learning strategies implemented in the classroom. Tenure-track education-focused faculty are more likely to teach with active-learning strategies compared to tenure-track research-focused faculty. Instructor and classroom characteristics that are also related to active learning include campus, discipline, and class size. The campus with initiatives and programs to support undergraduate STEM education is more likely to have instructors who adopt active-learning strategies. There is no difference in instructors in the Biological Sciences, Engineering, or Information and Computer Sciences disciplines who teach actively. However, instructors in the Physical Sciences are less likely to teach actively. Smaller class sizes also tend to have instructors who teach more actively. Conclusions: The novel tenure-track education-focused faculty position within the University of California system represents a formal structure that results in higher adoption of active-learning strategies in undergraduate STEM education.

The analysis utilised a sample of 7,272 students from target secondary schools in urban Yangon Region, Myanmar. Findings: It was found that since the introduction of CAPS, the grade repetition rates had fallen significantly in all SES groups, so was effective regardless of students' SES. The results also demonstrated the influence of unequal CAPS on dropout rates: in the middle-SES group, significant falls to nearly zero post-CAPS implementation. The high-SES group was at ceiling pre- and post-CAPS, so was unaffected. However, in the low-SES group, high dropout rates persisted, indicating that the poor socioeconomic backgrounds of these students significantly reduced the benefits of CAPS.

Understanding Social Constructions of Becoming an Academic through Women's Collective Career Narratives,"Barnard, Sarah; Rose, Anthea; Dainty, Andrew; Hassan, Tarek","The transition of early career researchers into academic posts is understood to be a crucial career step and marks a point at which representation of women declines significantly. The research adopts a participatory qualitative research methodology through career narrative interviews and group discussions with women engineers recently appointed into academic posts. It was found that academic careers are 'hoped for', but not described as a straightforward option in terms of either securing tenure or future career development. The collective career paths outlined were rarely linear and featured key moments of crisis and self-doubt, culminating in 'tentative' career identity formation in the face of gendered career structures.

Using Random Forest Analysis to Identify Student Demographic and High School-Level Factors That Predict College Engineering Major Choice,"Tan, Li; Main, Joyce B.; Darolia, Rajeev","Background: Given the importance of engineers to a nation's economy and potential innovation, it is imperative to encourage more students to consider engineering as a college major. Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering.",2021,,Journal of Engineering Education,110,3,572-593,2580766843; EJ1304066,https://doi.org/10.1002/jee.20393,,#263,Tan 2021,"",""

Most women recommend significant changes to the traditional model and its foundation, while a substantial minority of men support the status quo. However, this comparative qualitative analysis finds more cross-gender similarities than differences, as most men also want a more modern definition of success, perceiving the traditional model to be disproportionately supportive of one type of narrow research scholarship that does not align with the realities of most faculty's efforts.

Senior researchers worked on the average 50.4 hours a week, with 12% reporting to work more than 60 hours a week. The number of hours worked varied significantly with rank, where respondents in more senior ranks reported to work more hours. Once one controls for rank any gender differences in number of hours work disappear. We did observe a significant trade-off between the time spent on various activities. Postdocs spent more time on research than the other ranks, and senior professors spent more time on service and administration. Respondents from the humanities, and to a lesser degree from the social sciences, spent more time on education than respondents from other disciplines.

Additionally, how engineering faculty connected the role of HC awareness, emotions, self-efficacy, and self-advocacy concepts was studied. A mixed-method survey was disseminated to 55 engineering faculties across 54 institutions of higher education in the United States. Quantitative questions, which centered around the influences that gender, race, faculty rank, and institutional type played in participants' responses was analyzed using a combination of decision tree analysis with chi-square and correlational analysis. Qualitative questions were analyzed by a combination of tone-, open-, and focused-coding. The findings pointed to the primary roles that gender and institutional type (e.g., Tier 1) played in issues of fulfilling the professional expectations of the field. Furthermore, it was found that HC awareness and emotions and HC awareness and self-efficacy had moderate positive correlations, whereas, compared to self-advocacy, it had weak, negative correlations. Together, the findings point to the complex understandings and intersectional lived realities of many engineering faculty and hopes that through its findings can create awareness of the challenges and obstacles present in these professional environments.",2018,,Education Sciences,8,,1-21,2228637477; EJ1201003,,,#308,Villanueva 2018,"",""
Organizational Culture Types That Academicians Associate with Their Institutions,"Güngör, Semra Kiranli; Sahin, Hakan","This study, considering the sample of a university located in central Anatolia region, Turkey, aims to identify culture types that the academicians perceive in relevant with their institutions according to the 4 types of cultures (Clan, Adhocracy, Hierarchy, and Market) given in the Competing Values Framework by Cameron and Quinn. The study includes 205 academicians from different faculties and vocational schools as participants.

When Can Academic Researchers Rest?

The study focuses on research productivity and analyzes the impact of hiatuses in research production on promotion in universities as well as the time at which such hiatuses have the least impact on promotions. I divided the factors required for promotion into three categories: academic performance (the number of published articles, books, and competitive grants and funding sources acquired), social elements (gender), and elements related to the duration of periods with no research output and their timing. The results show that the probability of promotion to professorship increases as the number of papers in Scopus, the number of books published, and the amount of acquired competitive funds increase. As expected, longer declines in research productivity reduce the probability of promotion. However, it is not always necessary for researchers to publish continuously throughout their careers; the results show that a decline in research productivity other than during the first five years and the period from 20 to 30 years after the start of the research career has no influence on academic promotions.",2018,,Open Review of Educational Research,5,1,130-143,2228635851; EJ1200730,https://doi.org/10.1080/23265507.2018.1546552,,#310,Fujiwara 2018,"",""
Subverting and Minding Boundaries: The Intellectual Work of Women,"Gonzales, Leslie D.","Using various methods and analytical angles, researchers consistently show that members of non-dominant groups, including women, experience academia as a hostile and marginalizing space. Such work is important, and yet, it is equally important that researchers approach the study of women's academic careers by elevating their intellectual labor. In this study, I take up two questions: (1) What are the origins of women's intellectual work and (2) How do women go about doing their intellectual work? My findings suggest that women tend to locate the origins of their work in the everyday rather than in formal educational sites, such as disciplinary contexts or classrooms. In terms of the doing of their intellectual work, I found that most women utilize subversive tactics, as they challenge disciplinary and professional boundaries that have historically governed the recognition and legitimation of knowledge within academe. However, drawing from critical race feminism, I also find some notable distinctions between Women of Color and White women, and suggest that future researchers attend more carefully to how power and privilege yields particular conditions and consequences among women.

Effectiveness of a Required Health-Related Fitness Course on Dietary Behaviors among Community College Students,"Evans, Melissa S.; Massey-Stokes, Marilyn; Denson, Kathleen","Purpose: The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to: (a) evaluate the effectiveness of a required Health-Related Fitness (HRF) course in changing dietary behaviors among community college (CC) students, and (b) explore student perceptions about the effectiveness of HRF curriculum activities in changing behaviors. Methods: Pre- and post-semester data were gathered from 76 CC students (aged 18-34) enrolled in four HRF courses on a CC campus in Texas. Pre- and post-survey questions included demographic and dietary behavior questions from the College Student Health Survey. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data, while repeated measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) analyses were used to analyze dietary behaviors. Dietary behaviors were measured by fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption, meal patterns (breakfast, fast food, restaurant eating), and sugar sweetened beverage intake (soda, diet soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks, coffee drinks, and other sweetened beverages). Frequency statistics were conducted on themes emerging from open-ended questions (post-survey). Results: No significant changes were found in FV consumption. There were meaningful changes in dietary patterns, including significant increases in breakfast eating, significant decreases in sports drink consumption, and decreases in other sugar-sweetened beverage categories. Most students (96.1%) reported that the HRF course was beneficial. Participants' curriculum recommendations included additional instructional time regarding selection and preparation of healthier foods. Sustainability suggestions included tracking, motivation, support, and continuing education. Conclusions: Significant changes among meal patterns and sugar-sweetened beverages represent positive shifts, yet additional instructional time and course activities may be warranted to increase FV consumption. The HRF course appears to be a valuable intervention for teaching healthy lifestyle behaviors to the young adult population. Recommendations: Additional research is needed to compare different age groups, gender and ethnic differences, and four-year vs. CC students. Longitudinal studies can be helpful in determining long-term influences of HRF courses on students' health behaviors. Focus groups can also be implemented to capture additional information regarding students' perceptions about the HRF course and modifications to enhance learning and promote lasting healthy behavior change. Additionally, experiential learning activities can be integrated to enhance retention of learning and develop students' self-efficacy for adopting healthy dietary behaviors.",2018,,Journal of Health Education Teaching,9,1,1-13,2101388476; EJ1179841,,,#312,Evans 2018,"",""

I reviewed evidence concerning sex differences in mathematical and spatial aptitude, biases in hiring, funding, publishing, remuneration, and promotion, and gendered preferences. I conclude that the most important causes of underrepresentation appear to occur before women matriculate in college and are concerned with ability-related beliefs, stereotypes, and preferences starting in early elementary school, which by the end of high school have reduced the size of the potential pool.

Finding a Voice in Predominantly White Institutions: A Longitudinal Study of Black Women Faculty Members' Journeys toward Tenure,"Kelly, Bridget; Winkle-Wagner, Rachelle","Background/Context: Amidst scholarship that underscores the importance of Black women faculty in higher education, Black women are often not being retained in faculty positions at research universities. There is a gap in the research relative to how Black women experience the tenure process at predominantly White institutions, and this may have important implications for both recruitment and retention of Black women faculty. Purpose: This analysis attempts to fill a gap in the literature on the recruitment and retention of faculty of color by asking: What are the experiences of Black women faculty on the tenure track at PWIs who are the only woman of color faculty member in their academic program? Drawing on data from qualitative longitudinal research with Black women faculty who were on the tenure track at PWIs, the primary purpose of this analysis was to understand four Black women's longitudinal reflections on their journey toward tenure at PWIs where they are ""othered"" by gender and race. Setting and Participants: This project was part of a larger study of 22 women faculty who were on tenure-lines in two predominantly White research universities. This study focused on four Black women from this larger study. Research Design: This study employed a qualitative longitudinal research design. Data Collection and Analysis: As part of the qualitative longitudinal research design, interviews were conducted each year for five years with each participant. Findings: The findings of this analysis with Black women faculty on the tenure-line suggests that despite being the only person of color in their academic programs, they found ways to use their voice in and outside the academy. Finding and using their voices in the academy became a way to push back and resist some of the isolation and racism that the women experienced in the academy, and often the women did so in collectivist spaces with other Black women. Conclusions/Recommendations: These findings of this study call into question predominantly White and male spaces in academia and ways that these spaces should be challenged to change. The Black women in this study coped by creating collectivist spaces and finding/using their voices. Rather than focusing on how to encourage Black women to cope and survive in academia, there should be more emphasis on how to change institutional and departmental structures to make these spaces more inclusive and collectivist.",2017,,Teachers College Record,119,6,1-36,2458995844; EJ1260694,,,#325,Kelly 2017,"",""

Logistic regression confirms that controlling for human capital and cultural or identity taxation washes away the differences between being tenured and promoted for female faculty. Differences for racialized faculty remain, offering evidence of racial discrimination in the academic system.",2017,,Canadian Journal of Higher Education,47,3,54-75,2011270512; EJ1165047,,,#330,Wijesingha 2017,"",""
"Whose Job Is It, Anyway? The Place of Public Engagement in The Liberal Arts College","Christie, Luke D.; Djupe, Paul A.; O'Rourke, Sean Patrick; Smith, Elizabeth S.","The calls for academics to engage the public have grown, motivated by concerns for civic health and for maintaining public and political support for higher education and academic research. Whatever its value to the public sphere, there is still considerable uncertainty about whether and how public engagement counts--is it valued by colleagues and institutions in promotion and tenure decisions? We sought to provide evidence to assess the value of public engagement with experimental and observational methods set in a survey of faculty from seven liberal arts colleges. We find that public engagement is valued and engaged by these faculty, with variation observed by institution, mode of public engagement, and college division (arts faculty the most supportive and science faculty the least). We recommend institutions communicate clearly how they value public engagement; until that point, academics should tread carefully as they seek public audiences and partnerships.",2017,,Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement,21,4,23-49,2011270196; EJ1163714,,,#331,Christie 2017,"",""

Determination of Classroom Pre-Service Teachers' State of Personal Innovativeness,"Yorulmaz, Alper; Çokçaliskan, Halil; Önal, Halil","Today, in every passing moment, a new piece of information is acquired and the accumulation of this information leads to social and technological developments. Therefore, today, individuals are expected to rapidly adjust to innovations. As such, individuals should be open to innovations and willing to adopt innovations; that is, they need to be innovative. In this regard, most of the responsibility for training innovative individuals within formal education should be assumed by classroom teachers as they are working in the first stage of compulsory education. In order to be able train innovative individuals, classroom teachers should posses the characteristics of innovativeness. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was set to be to determine the pre-service classroom teachers' state of innovativeness and investigate it in relation to different variables. The current study was conducted on 322 pre-service classroom teachers randomly selected from among the classroom teachers attending a university in 2014-2015 academic year. In the collection of the data, ""Personal Innovativeness Scale"" adapted to Turkish by Kiliçer and Odabasi (2010) was employed. In the current study, the internal consistency of the scale was found to be 0.74. At the end of the study, it was found that the pre-service classroom teachers' mean personal innovativeness level is medium and the state of their innovativeness varies depending on gender in favor of the female pre-service teachers. Moreover, the male pre-service teachers were found to be more resistant to change than the female pre-service teachers. The grade level and academic achievement variables were found to be not significantly affecting the pre-service classroom teachers' state of innovativeness. In light of these findings, it was suggested that pre-service teachers should be given adequate training during their pre-service education so that they could design activities to educate their prospective students as innovative individuals.",2017,,Journal of Education and Training Studies,5,1,28-34,1969011639; EJ1122554,,,#334,Yorulmaz 2017,"",""

Sixty-six per cent of middle managers reported work as very stressful and 63% of this group reported a significant change in their wellbeing. No gender differences were observed within this study however aspects of the content (e.g. ""workload"") and context (e.g. ""changing demands"") of work presented as significant occupational hazards for class teachers and middle managers with > 10 YCR. Middle managers were the only group concerned with ""low staff morale"" and we would suggest the consequences of change and a lack of time. On the basis of our findings and, in light of debates centring on teacher wellbeing, quality retention and high quality educational provision, we would argue that these teachers with > 10 YCR, are in need of the physical and emotional space to reflect on and make sense of the changing context of work before they reach a point where their wellbeing is compromised. This space could be created by increasing weekly non-teaching time, restructuring the school day and/or providing sabbaticals that enable teachers to focus exclusively on their professional learning.

Productivity is measured as the total number of publications in a three-year period. We show how personal and academic variables explain differences in productivity within universities and fields of studies and across fields of research. Female workers report lower productivity than their male counterparts, but family responsibilities do not explain this gender gap. The type of contract and tenure or rank do not seem to have any influence on productivity. Researchers seeking professional promotion rather than altruism or personal satisfaction are more productive and young scholars publish more than their older counterparts. Additionally, we find a certain research-teaching trade-off and some nuances in the predictors of publication productivity across birth cohorts and fields of study.

Factors and Conditions Promoting Academic Resilience: A TIMSS-Based Analysis of Five Asian Education Systems,"Sandoval-Hernández, Andrés; Bialowolski, Piotr","It is well documented that academic achievement of students from families of low socioeconomic status (SES) tends to be below their more socially advantaged peers. Several studies have identified factors and conditions that facilitate academic success for disadvantaged students (i.e., promote academic resilience). However, one of the main criticisms of this body of research is in the set of variables that explain academic success for low-SES students and which is not very different from the variables that would explain academic success for all students. The objectives of this article are dual: firstly, to identify factors and conditions associated with academic success, regardless of student SES, and secondly, to identify factors and conditions associated with academic resilience, that is, exclusively for low-SES students. To this end, we used data from Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, and Japan in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011. The study sample covered 23,354 students in 720 schools in the five countries. The strategy for analysis was driven by fit of logistic regression models, first predicting the probability of academic success and then subsequent identification of variables significant as predictors for success within the pool of low-SES students. Results indicated that variables, such as positive student attitude to mathematics, teacher confidence in student performance and the test language being spoken at home, were associated with greater chances of academic success. High academic expectations and time spent on mathematics at home demonstrated a differential effect between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students in Singapore. In Korea, being male (gender) and in Taipei, low levels of bullying at school, increased the likelihood of resilience.

Intention of College Students to Receive the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine,"Richards, Keith","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to better understand what influences the intentions of college students to receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the USA and cancers related to HPV are on the rise. Design/Methodology/Approach: A 2×2 experimental design was used to predict the intentions. Messages were created that manipulated the level of severity and vulnerability to determine which would increase intentions to receive the HPV vaccine. Each of the 278 participants viewed a message that contained one severity message (high or low) and one vulnerability message (high or low). Findings: Regression was used to determine that elements of the protection motivation theory such as vulnerability and fear, along with norms, and information seeking explained a significant portion of the variance in intent to be vaccinated (R[superscript 2] = 0.40, F(4, 268) = 44.47, p <0.001).

Relation between Democratic Leadership and Organizational Cynicism,"Terzi, Ali Riza; Derin, Ramazan","This study intends to analyze the relation between school principals' leadership styles and teachers' perception of organizational cynicism. The study group consists of 268 participants teaching at high schools in the Balikesir district of Turkey during 2014-2015 academic year. In the study, which used relational survey model, data was collected through Democratic Leadership Scale and Organizational Cynicism Scale and analyzed by mean scores, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and simple linear regression. The results revealed that democratic leadership is a significant predictor of organizational cynicism, and it is negatively connected with organizational cynicism. In addition, it was found that there were significant differences between seniority and gender groups as regards democratic leadership, between seniority groups as regards all dimensions of organizational cynicism, and between gender as regards affective cynicism. All the results of the study showed that the democratic leadership style displayed by school principals influences the organizational cynicism perceived by teachers.",2016,,Journal of Education and Learning,5,3,193-204,1826546606; EJ1104704,,,#355,Terzi 2016,"",""
Geography Teachers' Attitudes and Beliefs Regarding Classroom Management,"Dikmenli, Yurdal; Çifçi, Taner","This study scrutinizes geography teachers' attitude and belief levels regarding classroom management. As a matter of fact, classroom management is one of the prominent areas emphasized by all educators. Descriptive correlational survey model was used in the study. Study group includes 58 geography teachers working in Sivas province during the 2015-2016 academic year. Convenience sampling method was employed while forming the study group. The Attitudes & Beliefs on Classroom Control Inventory developed by Martin, Yin & Baldwin (1998) and adapted into Turkish language by Sarvan (2002) was employed to collect the data. The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 17. To analyze the relationships between the variables, t-test for independent samples, Mann Whitney-U test, and Pearson's correlation were used. Significance level was set to be p<0.05. Geography teachers' mean scores for the sub-dimensions of instructional management and people management and their mean total scores for classroom management attitude and belief corresponded to medium level (interactionalist classroom management). Their mean scores for the sub-dimension of behavior management corresponded to low level (non-interventionist classroom management). No significant difference was found between the geography teachers' mean scores for the sub-dimensions of instructional management, people management, and behavior management and total scores for classroom management attitude and belief by gender and the type of the high school they work in. In addition, no significant relationship was found between years in teaching and instructional management. However, a negative significant relationship was detected between teachers' years in teaching and people management, behavior management, and classroom management attitude and belief. It is recommended that arrangements and studies be made for teachers to develop attitudes and beliefs that will allow their students to know themselves, make decisions, and carry out tasks either individually or in group.",2016,,International Journal of Higher Education,5,2,283-291,1826536080; EJ1099824,,,#356,Dikmenli 2016,"",""

The Health Sciences discipline typically falls within this paradigm, prompting various approaches to promote academic success and overall student retention. In this study, the demographic and previous education of health science students at an Australian University, were analysed along with first year science grades from a core first year anatomy and physiology unit. A generalized linear model (GLM) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between performance in the unit (measured by grade point average) and year 12 Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) subjects (human biology and chemistry; p<0.001) and gender (p<0.001).

The sample included application materials submitted by 191 candidates for tenure-track faculty positions at a public research university in computer science, political science, and psychology. Application letters and diversity statements were coded for 9 diversity dimensions. For example, ""My research in the Latino community . . .,"" and ""I volunteer at a middle school to encourage more girls to pursue computer science . . .,"" would be coded as reflecting the diversity dimensions of ethnicity/race and gender, respectively. Applicant self-disclosures of diversity were uncommon, occurring in fewer than 1 quarter of the letters. Nonspecific forms of diversity were most frequently mentioned in application materials, followed by references to ethnicity/race, disability, age, and gender. Comparisons between the searches revealed that psychologist applicants had significantly higher density of references to diversity in their letters than the 2 other disciplines, and also were most likely to cite specific, rather than nonspecific, dimensions of diversity.

A Study Showing Research Has Been Valued over Teaching in Higher Education,"Chen, Chi Yusn","Research has been valued and given priority over teaching for a long time in academia. In recent decades, the Taiwanese Ministry of Education has pursued objective and quantitative research criteria and has encouraged higher education institutions to ask teachers to publish papers in SSCI or SCI journals as part of the criteria for promotion and evaluation. This policy strengthens the concept that research has priority over teaching because teachers must devote more time to research than to teaching in order to be promoted and evaluated. The purpose of this study is to explore the influences that cause teachers to value research over teaching. To achieve this purpose, document analysis, the analysis of Taiwan Higher Education database and interviews were adapted as methods. First of all, our researchers collected and analyzed the documents for promotion and evaluation of twelve different universities whose areas of specialty included general studies, education, medicine, vocational studies, and the arts. Then, the study used and analyzed the empirical data of teachers' working hours every week for different tasks from the Taiwan Higher Education Database which investigated the working conditions of teachers in higher education in 2004. Additionally, twenty professors who have different areas of study and work in different types of universities were interviewed to collect teachers' opinions of the task priority of research, teaching, and service duties. The results showed that academia in Taiwan exhibits the phenomenon that research is valued over teaching. The reasons are due to the requirements of the reward system. The reward system emphasizes research over teaching and service. Teachers' research achievements are judged based on publishing articles in different types of journals and the amount of research funding they can obtain. The results also showed that every week teachers spend the most time on teaching, then on research, and finally on service. However, teachers emphasize research as the most important task, then teaching, and finally service. Although the majority of teachers think research is the most important duty, there is still twenty percent of teachers who think it is the least important. Although teaching has been thought of as the second most important duty after research, it is the task that the most teachers give as the first priority as far as time spent and none of the interviewees thought it is the least important. Universities and teachers all try to use their professionalism as capital to gain financial support from the government. This situation forces teachers to try to put more time and energy into research, but they still need to maintain teaching and service work quality. Some teachers focus more time and energy on research and ignore the needs of students. Working time endlessly increases even for teachers who out value on both teaching and research. Some suggestions based on the findings have been proposed for Taiwanese higher institutions.",2015,,Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,15,3,15-32,1720059112; EJ1064434,,,#366,Chen 2015,"",""

These resources comprise of two components, an interactive electronic web-based programme and a floor mat illustrating a naked boy and girl. The electronic web-based programme is used to introduce puberty changes, loving relationships, conception, pregnancy and birth and is suitable for students aged nine to 12 years. The floor mat is suitable to be used with students aged between five and 12 years. Teaching activities can include naming body parts, discussing gender differences, personal safety, distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate touching, discussing puberty changes and other health promotion activities as well as delivering aspects of the National Curriculum for Wales. Findings: The results from the initial evaluation undertaken with year six students and teachers demonstrates how the resources have impacted on the teaching and learning experiences of primary teachers and students. It also demonstrates how the teacher training sessions and using the Tyfu i Fyny/Growing Up resources have increased teachers' confidence in delivering SRE. Practical implications: The learning experiences of students and their enjoyment of using the Tyfu i Fyny/Growing Up resources were significantly high. The implementation of teacher training improved teaching practice and increased teachers' confidence in the subject. The resources have facilitated the delivery of effective whole school comprehensive SRE programmes for primary schools. These factors confirm the value of the investment given to their development. The resources could easily be customised in line with diverse ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious requirements. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates how the Tyfu i Fyny/Growing Up interactive SRE resources have influenced the teaching and learning experiences of primary school teachers and students.",2015,,Health Education,115,1,38-55,1697503299; EJ1053981,https://doi.org/10.1108/HE-12-2013-0065,,#377,Roberts 2015,"",""

The Female Fish Is More Responsive: Gender Moderates the BFLPE in the Domain of Science,"Plieninger, Hansjörg; Dickhäuser, Oliver","Academic self-concept is positively related to individual achievement but negatively related to class- or school-average achievement: the big-fish--little-pond effect (BFLPE). This contrast effect results from social comparison processes. The BFLPE is known to be long-lasting, universal and robust. However, there is little evidence regarding its generalisability across genders. Females, as opposed to males, feel more attached to their peers and compare themselves more often. Thus, it was hypothesised that the BFLPE is larger for females. This was investigated with a focus on science self-concept in a German sample from an extension of the Programme for International Student Assessment 2006 study (N?=?35,015) using recent advances in multilevel modelling. Replicating previous findings, females reported lower self-concepts while controlling for achievement. Additionally, the BFLPE was replicated.

Faculty interest groups provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines to meet to explore common interests and share concerns and best practices. The faculty interest group described in this article was designed to explore and address the challenges faced by historically underrepresented faculty and facilitate the process of attaining reappointment, promotion, and tenure. Nationwide, nearly half of community college students come from populations that are also historically underrepresented, and community colleges are challenged to recruit and retain faculty that mirror the student body. Research demonstrates that historically underrepresented faculty members enrich the overall education of all students, and yet a significant number of those faculty members describe their college campuses as unwelcoming. Factors that make campuses unwelcoming for these faculty include, but are not limited to, the following: isolation and marginalization; salary disparities; microaggressions based on race, gender, and sexual identity; heightened visibility; and additional role demands.

Effects of Daily Physical Education on Physical Fitness and Weight Status in Middle School Adolescents,"Erfle, Stephen E.; Gamble, Abigail","Background: In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Health developed the Active Schools Program (ASP) which required 30?minutes of daily physical education (PE) in middle schools to reduce childhood obesity. This investigation evaluated the ASP effects on physical fitness and weight status in middle school adolescents throughout 1 academic year. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to recruit middle schools into an intervention group (N?=?30) or control group (N?=?9). Results: Physical fitness outcomes had larger intervention effects than weight status outcomes. These effects were most profound among at-risk students. Multiple linear regression analysis provided a best-guess effect of daily PE on body mass index (BMI) percentile of -1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-1.9, -0.5) for at-risk females and -0.8, 95% CI (-1.5, -0.1) for at-risk males. Much of this benefit is attributable to the differential increase in physical fitness achieved by students with the benefit of having daily PE. Conclusions: Thirty minutes of daily PE can be considered a scientific approach to ameliorate health outcomes in at-risk middle school adolescents, particularly among females. Improvements on BMI percentile among at-risk youth are presaged by greater improvements in physical fitness.

Acceptability of a salon-based intervention to promote colonoscopy screening among African American women,"Floyd, Tiffany D.; DuHamel, Katherine N.; Rao, Jessica; Shuk, Elyse; Jandorf, Lina","African American women have the highest colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates among women of any race/ethnicity in the United States. Colonoscopy screening is an efficacious procedure for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer, making it a promising tool in the effort to eliminate colorectal cancer disparities. Toward that end, the present qualitative study sought to assess acceptability of and preferences for a beauty salon–based intervention to promote colonoscopy screening among African American women. A total of 11 focus groups were conducted: 6 with staff from African American–serving salons (n = 3 with salon owners, n = 3 with salon stylists) and 5 with African American salon clients. Theory-guided focus group questions were used to explore participants’ beliefs, interests, and preferences associated with the proposed intervention. Results indicated that, across all subgroups, participants were highly supportive of the idea of a salon-based intervention to promote colonoscopy screening among African American women, citing reasons such as the commonplace nature of health discussions in salons and the belief that, with proper training, stylists could effectively deliver colorectal cancer-related health information to their clients. The greatest differences between salon staff and clients were found with respect to the specifics of the intervention. Staff focused more heavily on content-related issues, such as the specific information that should be stressed in the intervention, whereas clients focused largely on process-related issues, such as the preferred intervention formats and how stylists should present themselves to clients.

Acute physical exercise promotes the consolidation of emotional material,"Jentsch, Valerie L.; Wolf, Oliver T.","Physical exercise can improve cognitive functions and promote learning and memory, especially when performed in close temporal proximity to the encoding of information. This benefit may occur due to circulating stress hormones released in response to acute exercise. When administered after encoding, acute stress typically enhances the consolidation of emotional stimuli. However, whether acute exercise also selectively modulates emotional memories remains to be explored. Likewise, the potential role of sex in moderating these effects has not been addressed so far. Here, we tested whether a single bout of aerobic exercise after learning boosts the consolidation and thus long-term memory for emotional versus neutral visuospatial stimuli. Healthy men and women learned an object-location task and subsequently were exposed to a vigorous-treadmill running task or control intervention. Memory was assessed 24 h later. Acute exercise significantly increased heart rate and salivary cortisol in both sexes and selectively facilitated the consolidation of emotional stimuli. In particular, we found improved memory for negative items in women and better recall of positive items in men following exercise exposure. This memory benefit was positively related to the increase in heart rate and cortisol in both men and women, suggesting that the favorable effects of acute exercise on emotional memory may be mediated via a co-activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Our findings thereby provide first evidence for the improvement of emotional memory consolidation by acute physical exercise that appears to rely on similar neuroendocrine mechanisms as psychosocial stressors. Given that exercise is healthy, cost-effective and practical in nature, it constitutes an ideal behavioral intervention strategy for boosting memory in clinical and educational settings alike.

"Addressing cancer screening inequities by promoting cancer prevention knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and screening uptake among low-income and illiterate immigrant women in France","De Jesus, Maria; Rodrigue, Christelle M.; Rahmani, Sarah; Balamou, Christian","Objective: Cancer screening rates are suboptimal for disadvantaged populations in France, yet little evidence exists on their cancer-related knowledge and screening barriers. The main objective of this study was to examine cancer-related knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and perceptions of screening barriers among low-income, illiterate immigrant women in France following an 8-weeks cancer educational intervention. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 164 female participants in the Ain department of France between January 2019 and March 2020. Adopting the Health Belief Model as an intervention and analytic framework, salient themes were identified using qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Increased levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of cancer contributed to higher motivation to get screened. Barriers to screening included low French proficiency, shame surrounding illiteracy, and constant worries due to precarious living conditions. Perceived benefits (e.g., valuing one’s health and health-promoting behaviors), cues to action from a trusted source, and greater self-efficacy (e.g., more autonomous in healthcare-seeking) outweighed perceived barriers, including cultural barriers. Conclusions: Implications include developing audience-responsive targeted cancer screening communication strategies and educational materials to increase screening rates and reduce cancer and cancer screening inequities.

"Age/sex differences in third-party rank relationship knowledge in wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus","Borgeaud, Christèle; Alvino, Morgane; van Leeuwen, Kelly; Townsend, Simon W.; Bshary, Redouan","In mammals it has been proposed that complex social environments have selected for sophisticated social strategies. Third-party and more specifically third-party rank relationship knowledge is an important requirement for such strategies, especially in species with a strict hierarchy such as primates. Previous research has demonstrated that female vervet monkeys know the entire female hierarchy within their group, suggesting a detailed knowledge of their surrounding social world. What remains unclear, however, is the extent and detail of such social knowledge in other age/sex classes. We used the same experimental design to test whether females and males also keep track of each other's hierarchy and whether juveniles know about the female hierarchy. Our results suggest that females know about the male hierarchy but that males and juveniles seem to lack such knowledge regarding the female hierarchy. This indicates sex and developmental differences in the extent of social knowledge and especially third-party rank relationship knowledge in vervet monkeys. As a consequence, sophisticated social strategies may most likely be found in adult females in this species.

Agonist-promoted kappa opioid receptor (KOR) phosphorylation has behavioral endpoint-dependent and sex-specific effects,"Huang, Peng; Chen, Chongguang; Cao, Danni; Huang, Melody; Liu-Chen, Lee-Yuan","We reported previously that the selective agonist U50,488H promoted phosphorylation of the mouse kappa opioid receptor (mKOR) in vitro at four residues in the C-terminal domain. In this study, we generated a mutant mouse line in which all the four residues were mutated to Ala (K4A) to examine the in vivo functional significance of agonist-induced KOR phosphorylation. U50,488H promoted KOR phosphorylation in brains of the wildtype (WT), but not K4A, male and female mice. Autoradiography of [3H] 69,593 binding to KOR in brain sections showed that WT and K4A mice had similar KOR distribution and expression levels in brain regions without sex differences. In K4A mice, U50,488H inhibited compound 48/80-induced scratching and attenuated novelty-induced hyperlocomotion to similar extents as in WT mice without sex differences. Interestingly, repeated pretreatment with U50,488H (80 mg/kg, s.c.) resulted in profound tolerance to the anti-scratch effects of U50,488H (5 mg/kg, s.c.) in WT mice of both sexes and female K4A mice, while in male K4A mice tolerance was attenuated. Moreover, U50,488H (2 mg/kg) induced conditioned place aversion (CPA) in WT mice of both sexes and male K4A mice, but not in female K4A mice. In contrast, U50,488H (5 mg/kg) caused CPA in male, but not female, mice, regardless of genotype. Thus, agonist-promoted KOR phosphorylation plays important roles in U50,488H-induced tolerance and CPA in a sex-dependent manner, without affecting acute U50,488H-induced anti-pruritic and hypo-locomotor effects. These results are the first to demonstrate sex differences in the effects of GPCR phosphorylation on the GPCR-mediated behaviors.

Amplifying older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s perspectives to promote digital health equity: Co-designed qualitative study,"Henson, Connie; Chapman, Felicity; Shepherd, Gina; Carlson, Bronwyn; Rambaldini, Boe; Gwynne, Kylie","Background: Digital health is becoming ubiquitous, and we must ensure equity in access. Indigenous people across most high-income countries typically have not benefited as much as other citizens from usual health care systems and technologies. Despite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's clear interest in, and enthusiastic use of, new technologies, little research has examined the needs or interests of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Objective: This study prioritizes the perspectives of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, tapping into their expertise associated with Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing, as well as their unique position within their families and communities, to design a model for using digital technologies to improve health for themselves and their families as well as their communities. Methods: Older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from 4 partner organizations were recruited for this study. This co-designed qualitative research included citizen scientists in shaping the protocol as well as collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. We used yarning, an Indigenous research method validated for use in health research with Indigenous people and seen as respectful and culturally safe, as a primary research tool. The use of Indigenous methodologies and our iterative process enabled us to deeply explore and incorporate perspectives from all participants and ensure that the perspectives of Indigenous citizen scientists with lived experience were privileged. The data-checking methods also used a yarning methodology, which ensured that the findings and translational model derived from the findings were validated by the participants. Results: Participants comprised 24 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged ≥41 years and including 3 generations that did not grow up with the internet: seniors, baby boomers, and Generation X. The key findings in this research were that older women use various digital technologies to improve health and well-being for themselves and their families as well as their communities. Older Aboriginal women want a culturally sensitive cyberspace that caters specifically to their needs and includes relevant content and functionality that are accessible and efficient. Our translational model highlights the conditions necessary for anyone to use digital health technologies, summarizes the essential elements needed to promote equity in digital health, and illuminates the unmet needs and requirements for older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to fully benefit from digital health technologies. Conclusions: Health is a fundamental right. As we move toward greater reliance on digital health solutions, we must recognize and address the concerns of the smaller populations of people who differ in their needs. We must urgently address the financial, connectivity, and other limiting factors highlighted by older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in this study that limit equitable access to digital health tools.

Are we promoting boys and girls equally? An analysis of boys’ and girls’ participation in community prevention,"Weyers, Simone; Kreffter, Katharina; Götz, Simon; Nguyen, Thuy H.; Lisak-Wahl, Stefanie; Fischer, Inken; Wessely, Stefanie; Joisten, Christine","Aim: Despite consensus that prevention and health promotion need to address gender aspects and differences, not much is known about how boys and girls in infancy (or their parents) make use of existing non-medical community programmes. The aim of the study was therefore to analyse the extent to which boys and girls or their parents in distinct social circumstances participate in respective programmes. Subject and methods: We conducted secondary analyses for two study samples: The COLIPRE Study includes (n = 6.480) pre-schoolers from Duesseldorf; the SKILLS Study includes (n = 637) pre-schoolers and school children from Cologne. Social circumstances included parental education, employment status, family status, migration background, mother language and neighbourhood deprivation. Prevention participation included programmes for a healthy diet, physical activity, child education and language development. We used Poisson regressions to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted for age, siblings and BMI, stratified for boys and girls. Results: In both studies, we observed no gender differences in general participation. Taking a range of social circumstances into account, we found that boys and girls with specific disadvantages were underrepresented in programmes to promote a healthy diet, physical activity and child education. By contrast, boys and girls with a migration background participate in language promotion programmes more often than their German-native peers. Conclusion: More effort should be put into developing programmes for boys and girls and their parents in difficult social circumstances.

Career advancement among women physicians in nine academic medicine specialties,"Lee, Moon O.; Flores, Brenda; Fassiotto, Magali; Hobgood, Cherri","Objective: Gender parity lags in academic medicine. We applied the Rank Equity Index (REI) to compare the longitudinal progress of women's academic medicine careers. We hypothesized that women have different rank parity in promotion by specialty based on the proportion of women in the specialty. Materials and Methods: Aggregate data by sex for medical students, residents, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors in nine specialties were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges for 2019–2020. Specialties were clustered into terciles based on the proportion of women in the field: upper (obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry), middle (internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia), and lower (surgery, urology, and orthopedic surgery). We calculated the percentage representation by sex by specialty and rank to calculate REI. Specialty-specific REI comparisons between each rank were performed to assess parity in advancement. Results: Only specialties in the upper tercile recruited proportionally more women medical students to residency training. All specialties advanced women for the resident-to-assistant professor with psychiatry, internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia, urology, and orthopedic surgery that promoted women faculty at rates above parity. No specialty demonstrated parity in advancement based on sex for the assistant professor-to-associate professor or associate professor-to-professor transitions. Conclusion: Gender inequity in advancement is evident in academic medicine starting at the assistant professor-to-associate professor stage, regardless of overall proportion of women in the specialty. This suggests a common set of barriers to career advancement of women faculty in academic medicine that must be addressed starting at the early career stage.

Changing social norms: The importance of 'organized diffusion' for scaling up community health promotion and women empowerment interventions,"Cislaghi, Beniamino; Denny, Elaine K.; Cissé, Mady; Gueye, Penda; Shrestha, Binita; Shrestha, Prabin Nanicha; Ferguson, Gemma; Hughes, Claire; Clark, Cari Jo","Some harmful practices are sustained by social norms—collective beliefs about what people expect from each other. Practitioners and researchers alike have been investigating the potential of social norms theory to inform the design of effective interventions addressing these practices in low- and middle-income countries. One approach commonly used to facilitate social norms change is community-based dialogs and trainings. This approach has often been criticized for not being cost-effective, as it usually includes a relatively small number of direct participants and does not allow for scaling-up strategies. In spite of some evidence (as for instance, the SASA! Program) that community dialogs can achieve social norms change, little exists in the literature about how exactly participants in community dialogs engage others in their networks to achieve change. In this paper, we look at the potential of 'organized diffusion' as a cost-effective strategy to expand the positive effects of community-based interventions to participants’ networks, achieving sustainable normative shifts. We provide quantitative evidence from three case studies—Community Empowerment Program in Mali, Change Starts at Home in Nepal, and Voices for Change in Nigeria—showing that participants in community-based interventions can be effectively empowered to share their new knowledge and understandings systematically with others in their networks, eventually facilitating social norms change. Future community-based interventions intending to achieve social norms change would benefit from integrating ways to help participants engage others in their network in transformative conversations. Doing so has the potential to generate additional impact with little additional investment.

Descriptive analyses were conducted to evaluate intervention effects in relation to the consideration of sex/gender in the studies based on a newly developed checklist. Additionally, meta-analyses were performed to determine the effect of interventions on girls’ and boys’ leisure-time PA. Results: Overall 31 unique studies reported 44 outcomes on leisure-time PA and 20,088 participants were included in the current study. Consideration of sex/gender aspects in studies is low. PA outcomes with statistically significant same/similar effects in boys and girls showed higher quality of reporting sex/gender aspects of theoretical and/or conceptual linkages with sex/gender, measurement instruments, intervention delivery, location and interventionists and participant flow than PA outcomes without significant effects in both boys and girls or effects only in boys or girls.

Delay discounting as a behavioral phenotype associated with social rank in female and male cynomolgus monkeys: Correlation with kappa opioid receptor availability,"Johnson, Bernard N.; Allen, Mia I.; Reboussin, Beth A.; LaValley, Christina; Nader, Michael A.","Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant problem worldwide, with no FDA-approved treatments. Epidemiological data indicate that only about 17 % of people that use cocaine will meet DSM criteria for CUD. Thus, the identification of biomarkers predictive of eventual cocaine use may be of great value. Two potentially useful predictors of CUD are social hierarchies in nonhuman primates and delay discounting. Both social rank and preference for a smaller, immediate reinforcer relative to a larger, delayed reinforcer have been predictive of CUD. Therefore, we wanted to determine if there was also a relationship between these two predictors of CUD. In the present study, monkeys cocaine-naive responded under a concurrent schedule of 1- vs. 3-food pellets and delivery of the 3-pellet option was delayed. The primary dependent variable was the indifference point (IP), which is the delay that results in 50 % choice for both options. In the initial determination of IP, there were no differences based on sex or social rank of the monkeys. When the delays were redetermined after ~25 baseline sessions (range 5–128 sessions), dominant females and subordinate males showed the largest increases in IP scores from the first determination to the second. Because 13 of these monkeys had prior PET scans of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), we examined the relationship between KOR availability and IP values and found that the change in IP scores from the first to the second determination significantly negatively predicted average KOR availability in most brain regions. Future studies will examine acquisition to cocaine self-administration in these same monkeys, to determine if IP values are predictive of vulnerability to cocaine reinforcement.

Demographic differences in Canadian medical students’ motivation and confidence to promote physical activity,"McFadden, Taylor; Fortier, Michelle; McGinn, Ryan; Levac, Brendan M.; Sweet, Shane N.; Tomasone, Jennifer R.","Background. Physical activity (PA) remains under prescribed by physicians. Motivation and confidence are clear drivers of frequency of promoting PA. Research shows demographic differences in physicians’ preventive practices, yet none have included medical students who form habits during training. Objectives. Study objectives were to (i) examine how Canadian medical students’ motivation to recommend PA to future patients differs according to six demographic variables (i.e. gender, ethnicity, year of study, university, proposed specialty and academic background) and (ii) examine how Canadian medical students’ confidence to recommend PA to future patients differs according to these same demographic variables. Methods. A cross-sectional design was used. First to fourth year medical students from three medical schools responded to an online survey (N = 221). Results. Female participants were more motivated to counsel patients on PA and refer to an exercise specialist compared to males (P < 0.01). Second year students were more motivated to assess a patients’ level of PA compared to third and fourth year students (P < 0.01). Students pursuing family medicine were more confident to assess and counsel compared to students pursuing paediatrics (P < 0.01). Conclusion. Given that motivation and confidence have a positive influence on frequency-promoting PA, these results suggest where future efforts should focus, to improve PA promotion in medical practice. Physical inactivity continues to be a major issue worldwide, and medical students as future physicians have a unique opportunity to enhance PA amongst the population.

Participants were TWC ≥ 18 years living in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with at least one structural barrier to care and clinicians ≥18 years who provide care to TWC. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic coding and content analysis; barriers for TWC were categorized into Individual, Organizational, and Environmental levels. Several day-long meetings with TWC and stakeholders were convened to develop the intervention. Results: Saturation of theme on barriers to care was reached with 22 interviews. Identified barriers to service receipt included survival, instability, temporal discounting, and prioritizing hormone therapy over care, incongruence between providers and patients, pessimism, and lack of cultural competency. Each was intentionally addressed with the telehealth intervention. Conclusions: Data informed the development of an innovative and customized telehealth intervention for TWC. Through the integration of technology and peer consultant outreach, we developed a novel approach that can address population-specific challenges to care. Further development of this model may be able to improve health outcomes among TWC.

Early adolescent adversity inflates threat estimation in females and promotes alcohol use initiation in both sexes,"Walker, Rachel A.; Andreansky, Christopher; Ray, Madelyn H.; McDannald, Michael A.","Childhood adversity is associated with exaggerated threat processing and earlier alcohol use initiation. Conclusive links remain elusive, as childhood adversity typically co-occurs with detrimental socioeconomic factors, and its impact is likely moderated by biological sex. To unravel the complex relationships among childhood adversity, sex, threat estimation, and alcohol use initiation, we exposed female and male Long-Evans rats to early adolescent adversity (EAA). In adulthood, >50 days following the last adverse experience, threat estimation was assessed using a novel fear discrimination procedure in which cues predict a unique probability of footshock: danger (p = 1.00), uncertainty (p = .25), and safety (p = .00). Alcohol use initiation was assessed using voluntary access to 20% ethanol, >90 days following the last adverse experience. During development, EAA slowed body weight gain in both females and males. In adulthood, EAA selectively inflated female threat estimation, exaggerating fear to uncertainty and safety, but promoted alcohol use initiation across sexes. Meaningful relationships between threat estimation and alcohol use initiation were not observed, underscoring the independent effects of EAA. Results isolate the contribution of EAA to adult threat estimation, alcohol use initiation, and reveal moderation by biological sex.

Employing dissemination and implementation science to promote mental health equity for transgender youth,"Price, Maggi A.; Barnett, Miya L.; Cerezo, Alison; Broder-Fingert, Sarabeth; Matsuno, Em","Background: In recent years, the United States has witnessed increased transphobic rhetoric and legislation aimed at restricting the rights of transgender youth, ranging from banning transgender youth from school sports, to denying access to gender-affirming care. This climate has a detrimental impact on the mental health of transgender youth- a community that already experiences profound mental health risks due to their exposure to transphobia across multiple levels and in myriad settings. To combat transphobia and its negative effects on transgender youth’s mental health, scientific studies and methods addressing multiple levels and forms of transphobia are needed. Discussion: We review research on negative impacts of multilevel transphobia on transgender youth mental health and the benefits of gender-affirming psychotherapy practices. We then describe how dissemination and implementation (D&I) science—the scientific study of multilevel strategies and methods that facilitate the uptake of effectives services—can be used to promote the mental health of transgender youth. We call for increased D&I research to support the mental health needs of transgender youth. We recommend two broad domains of D&I research: (1) identify, test, and scale effective services for transgender youth and (2) address contextual barriers to implementing these services- specifically, state-level laws/policies, and lack of access to gender-affirming psychotherapy. Methodological recommendations and example studies are included in each domain. Conclusions: To enhance mental health equity for transgender youth, we must leverage D&I science to identify, test and scale services that have been shown to be promising (e.g., acceptable and feasible) or effective for transgender youth based on empirical research, including qualitative, observational, and/or pilot studies, as well as randomized controlled trials. These research efforts should also address law/policy barriers through advocacy and policy dissemination research, and overcome lack of access to appropriate care via online/mobile interventions.

Epigenetic promoter DNA methylation of miR-124 promotes HIV-1 tat-mediated microglial activation via MECP2-STAT3 axis,"Periyasamy, Palsamy; Thangaraj, Annadurai; Guo, Ming-Lei; Hu, Guoku; Callen, Shannon; Buch, Shilpa","The present study demonstrates HIV-1 Tat-mediated epigenetic downregulation of microglial miR-124 and its association with microglial activation. Exposure of mouse primary microglia isolated from newborn pups of either sex to HIV-1 Tat resulted in decreased expression of primary miR-124-1, primary miR-124-2 as well as the mature miR-124. In parallel, HIV-1 Tat exposure to mouse primary microglial cells resulted in increased expression of DNA methylation enzymes, such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, which were also accompanied by increased global DNA methylation. Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA sequencing in the HIV-1 Tat-exposed mouse primary microglial cells further confirmed increased DNA methylation of the primary miR-124-1 and primary miR-124-2 promoters. Bioinformatic analyses identified MECP2 as a novel 3 -UTR target of miR-124. This was further validated in mouse primary microglial cells wherein HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 resulted in increased expression of MECP2, leading in turn to further repression of miR-124 via the feedback loop. In addition to MECP2, miR-124 also modulated the levels of STAT3 through its binding to the 3 -UTR, leading to microglial activation. Luciferase assays and Ago2 immunoprecipitation determined the direct binding between miR-124 and 3 -UTR of both MECP2 and STAT3. Gene silencing of MECP2 and DNMT1 and overexpression of miR-124 blocked HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 and microglial activation. In vitro findings were also confirmed in the basal ganglia of SIV-infected rhesus macaques (both sexes). In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of HIV-1 Tat-mediated activation of microglia via downregulation of miR-124, leading ultimately to increased MECP2 and STAT3 signaling.

Epigenetics-by-sex interaction for somatization conferred by methylation at the promoter region of SLC6A4 gene,"Palma-Gudiel, H.; Peralta, V.; Deuschle, M.; Navarro, V.; Fañanás, L.","Background: Depression, anxiety and somatoform disorders are all more prevalent in women than in men. However, specific biological mechanisms contributing to such sex differences remain unknown. Serotonergic pathways are involved in mood and behavior regulation and thus have been suggested to be altered in several psychiatric disorders. The serotonin transporter (SERT), encoded by SLC6A4 gene, has received major attention due to its crucial role in serotonergic transmission. Methods: 148 monozygotic twin subjects were assessed for (i) lifetime categorical diagnosis of anxious-depressive disorders, following SCID-I-based DSM-IV criteria, and (ii) current psychiatric symptomatology, from a dimensional approach, by means of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). SLC6A4 gene methylation was analyzed by means of Infinium HumanMethylation450 in a subset of the sample. CpG-specific methylation at the promoter region of SLC6A4 gene was further analyzed by means of pyrosequencing technology in the total sample. Results: SLC6A4 methylation was found to be significantly higher in women when compared to men independent of DSM-IV diagnosis. SLC6A4 methylation was further associated with the BSI-derived somatization dimension. Conclusions: Female hypermethylation of a discrete region located within SLC6A4 promoter region could underlie differential SERT expression in women when compared to men and could be one of the causative mechanisms by which women exhibit increased prevalence of somatic symptoms.

The conceptual framework is informed by Social Cognitive Career Theory. Cross-sectional and longitudinal SNA are used to a) assess individual researchers’ network characteristics and their association with academic productivity; and b) examine if the association of network characteristics and academic productivity is mediated by self-efficacy and outcome expectations. Recruitment is designed to include early-career and senior researchers conducting mental health research, as well as students interested in pursuing a career in mental health research.

Exposure to fruit-flavoring during adolescence increases nicotine consumption and promotes dose escalation,"Patten, Theresa; Dreier, Allison; Herman, Rae J.; Kimball, Bruce A.; De Biasi, Mariella","The rise of e-cigarette popularity has sparked interest in the role of palatable flavors on nicotine use. Despite growing evidence that sweet flavorants enhance nicotine reward, their influence on nicotine consumption has not been studied extensively. In addition, the impact that flavored nicotine use in adolescence could have on nicotine reward and dependence in adulthood remains unclear. This study examined the role of flavored nicotine access on nicotine preference and consumption longitudinally, from adolescence to adulthood. Male and female adolescent mice preferred a fruit-flavored nicotine solution over an unflavored nicotine solution. However, only adolescent female mice with access to flavored nicotine consumed higher doses. Furthermore, while adolescent male mice escalated consumption of both flavored and unflavored nicotine, female mice only escalated nicotine consumption when given access to flavored nicotine. As mice matured into adulthood, there was no evidence that a history of flavored-nicotine access altered preference for unflavored nicotine compared to a nicotine-free control in a classic two-bottle choice design. However, when the nicotine concentration was progressively reduced, mice that had consumed strawberry-flavored nicotine in adolescence maintained baseline nicotine consumption levels longer than mice that initiated nicotine use without flavor in adolescence. Finally, addition of fruit-flavorants into the nicotine solution during adulthood led to nicotine preference and increased levels of nicotine consumption, regardless of previous flavored-nicotine access or of familiarity with the selected flavorant. These results indicate that flavorants increase nicotine consumption independent of life stage, possibly posing a disproportionate risk to adolescent females. Our results also point to an effect of adolescent flavored-nicotine use on nicotine dose maintenance in adulthood, which could have implications for the success of future quit attempts.

H.; Johnshon, C. A.; Li, Y.; Shih, J.; Bergen, A. W.; Nishita, D.; Swan, G. E.; Ahn, R.; Conti, D. V.","Objectives: Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) modulates metabolism of serotonin and dopamine metabolism, neurotransmitters involved in regulation of appetite and food intake. The gene coding for MAOA contains a 30-bp tandem repeat (uVNTR) polymorphism in its promoter region that has been previously identified to be associated with obesity with mixed findings in the literature. Our goals were to replicate the population effects of this functional polymorphism on obesity risk, and to further explore gender differences and interaction effects with negative stressors. Methods: Analyses were conducted with data on genotypes, measured weight and height, and self-reported behavioural characteristics among 1101 Chinese adolescents 11–15 years old living in Wuhan, China. Results: Girls with the high-activity allele had significantly lower body mass index (BMI; β = -0.25 ± 0.98, P = 0.011) compared to those with the low activity allele. Experience of negative familial stressors (e.g., death or illness of family members, hit or scolded by parents and increased quarrelling with parents, parents argued frequently) significantly weakened this protective genetic effect on BMI (P for interaction = 0.043). Stratified analyses showed a significant protective genetic effect on BMI only within the stratum of low stress level (β = -0.44 ± 0.14, P = 0.002). No similar effect was observed among boys.

Materials and Methods: Demographic information and academic rank were obtained for all faculty at the eight dental schools who received the most funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2017. Years since dental school graduation, total number of PubMed-indexed citations, first- and last-author publications, and H-index were determined for each faculty member. Gender differences in productivity and advancement were evaluated. Results: Of 702 faculty members, 36.5% were female; only 24.4% of full professors were women. Men had significantly higher numbers of publications (30.2 [95% confidence interval [CI, 28.6–39.5] vs. 20.4 [95% CI 16.3–24.6], p = 0.02) and higher H-index (8.2 [95% CI 7.1–9.1] vs. 4.7 [95% CI 3.9–5.5], p < 0.0001).

This study draws on stress process theory to identify stressors and supports for academic women. Through analysis of focus group data, the findings reveal that women in academia continue to experience extreme workplace hostilities and stressors, and that these stressors vary by rank. They also expose some ideas from the participants of successful supports that could improve equity in the academy. The article concludes with a discussion of how universities can implement supports for white women academics and academic women of colour by rank.

Gender-inclusive textisms: How Spanish-speaking educational communities promote linguistic innovations on Twitter,"Núñez-Román, Francisco; Gómez-Camacho, Alejandro; Hunt-Gómez, Coral I.","Any linguistic reform aimed at gender equality benefits from teacher's capacity as spreaders, and literature has shown that Twitter can be used as an excellent channel for the dissemination of good practice in language use. In a mixed-methods study based on public data mining and semantic content analysis, we examine how teachers use gender-fair language (GIL) in their digital communications on Twitter, what GIL procedures they use and, if Spanish digitalk incorporates specific textisms for GIL. Results confirmed that teachers make a widespread use of GIL procedures, prefer the use of collective nouns as a GIL mechanism, and intentionally incorporate GIL into digitalk through specific textisms, what we have named gender-inclusive textisms (GIT). The findings indicate that teachers are at the forefront of gender-inclusive language activism in educational virtual communities, and therefore, that although Twitter may contain messages that outrage the dignity of individuals, it is also a privileged space for linguistic innovations oriented toward gender equality.

Getting ahead in the social sciences: How parenthood and publishing contribute to gender gaps in academic career advancement,"Nielsen, Mathias Wullum; Pedersen, Jens Vognstoft; Larregue, Julien","How do parenthood and publishing contribute to gender gaps in academic career advancement? While extensive research examines the causes of gender disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers, we know much less about the factors that constrain women's advancement in the social sciences. Combining detailed career‐ and administrative register data on 976 Danish social scientists in Business and Management, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology (5703 person‐years) that obtained a PhD degree between 2000 and 2015, we estimate gender differences in attainment of senior research positions and parse out how publication outputs, parenthood and parental leave contribute to these differences. Our approach is advantageous over previous longitudinal studies in that we track the careers and publication outputs of graduates from the outset of their PhD education and match this data with time‐sensitive information on each individual's publication activities and family situation. In discrete time‐event history models, we observe a ∼24 per cent female disadvantage in advancement likelihoods within the first 7 years after PhD graduation, with gender differences increasing over the observation period. A decomposition indicates that variations in publishing, parenthood and parental leave account for ∼ 40 per cent of the gender gap in career advancement, suggesting that other factors, including recruitment disparities, asymmetries in social capital and experiences of unequal treatment at work, may also constrain women's careers.

Group versus individual culturally tailored and theory-based education to promote cervical cancer screening among the underserved Hispanics: A cluster randomized trial,"Calderón-Mora, Jessica; Byrd, Theresa L.; Alomari, Adam; Salaiz, Rebekah; Dwivedi, Alok; Mallawaarachchi, Indika; Shokar, Navkiran","Purpose: To determine whether group education is as effective as individual education in improving cervical cancer screening uptake along the US–Mexico border. Design: Cluster randomized controlled study. Setting: El Paso and Hudspeth Counties, Texas. Participants: Three hundred women aged 21 to 65 years, uninsured, due for a Pap test, no prior history of cervical cancer or hysterectomy. Intervention: Theory-based, culturally appropriate program comprised of outreach, educational session, navigation services, and no-cost cervical cancer testing. Measures: Baseline, immediate postintervention, and 4-month follow-up surveys measured knowledge and theoretical constructs from the Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Social Cognitive Theory. Analysis: Relative risk regression analyses to assess the effects of educational delivery mode on the uptake of screening. Mixed effect models to analyze changes in psychosocial variables. Results: One hundred and fifty women assigned to each educational group; 99% Hispanic. Of all, 85.7% completed the follow-up survey. Differences in screening rate at follow-up were analyzed by education type. Overall screening rate at follow-up was 73.2%, no significant difference by education type (individual: 77.6%, group: 68.9% P = .124).

Participants: A total of 378 female participants were contacted, of which 351 consented to participate and 347 completed valid questionnaires for analysis. Methods: Health literacy was measured with the Taiwan Health Literacy Scale, and health-promoting behaviors were measured by the Chinese version of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile. Results: Participants had a moderate level of health literacy, and one third of them had inadequate health literacy. Participants with inadequate health literacy were more likely to be younger, not a high school graduate, and Vietnamese; to have a low monthly family income and no diagnosed diseases; to use a second language; and to regard TV/radio as the most useful source of health information. Health literacy alone could significantly predict health-promoting behaviors among the participants.

"Ladies, know yourselves! Gentlemen, fool yourselves! Evolved self-promotion traits as predictors for promiscuous sexual behavior in both sexes","Koban, Kevin; Ohler, Peter","Creating a convincing self-presentation which exalts one's own capabilities on the surface is often regarded as a crucial soft skill ensuring success in numerous interpersonal domains. Seen from an evolutionary perspective, strategic self-promotion might have evolved as a beneficial psychological mechanism in mating competition. While prior research is almost exclusively focused on different behavioral patterns, the present study examines relations between self-promotion and mating behavior on a trait level. Based on existing findings, we identified three different traits corresponding with determined self-presentation styles: impression management, self-deceptive enhancement, and self-monitoring. Using a sample of 232 heterosexual participants (f = 143; age M = 23.88 years; SD = 3.42 years), we tested to what extent these traits predict sociosexual orientation as well as the total number of intercourse partners in both sexes. Notwithstanding gender, all chosen traits showed a positive prediction towards short-term mating behavior. By taking sex differences into consideration, however, the results indicated that self-deception was a stronger predictor for promiscuous mating behavior in men compared to women, whereas impression management showed minor differences and self-monitoring even revealed an opposite trend. These findings suggest that women may possess more rigorous deception detection mechanisms forcing men to apply subtler self-promotion strategies.

Litter and sex effects on maternal behavior and DNA methylation of the Nr3c1 exon 1₇ promoter gene in hippocampus and cerebellum,"Kosten, Therese A.; Nielsen, David A.","Early life events can alter gene expression through DNA methylation. The methylation status of the exon 17 promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1 gene) in hippocampus associates with frequency of pup licking. Much of this work was conducted with male rats. Because dams more frequently lick male pups, this may contribute to sex differences in phenotypes through DNA methylation. Modifying litter gender composition (LGC), in which offspring of single-sex litters are compared to mixed-sex litters, alters maternal behavior. Previously, we demonstrated that LGC and sex affected pup licking times as well as anxiety and hippocampal DNA methylation of the Nr3c1 exon 17 promoter gene in adolescence. Now, we expand upon this work by examining effects in cerebellum and measuring mRNA levels. We also re-assessed DNA methylation in hippocampus using pyrosequencing and re-analyzed pup licking with the more commonly used frequency measure. Litters, culled to 8 pups on postnatal day 1 (PN1), were assigned to one of three conditions: all male (n = 10), all female (n = 12), or half of each sex (n = 20). Licking was rated on PN4, 7, and 10. On PN35, hippocampal and cerebellar samples were obtained. Single-sex males were licked the least and mixed-sex males, the most. Hippocampal Nr3c1 mRNA levels were lowest in mixed females with no LGC or Sex effects in DNA methylation. Cerebellar DNA methylation levels were lowest in mixed males with no effect on mRNA levels.

National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track,"Williams, Wendy M.; Ceci, Stephen J.","National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/ colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants’ profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields,with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science.

Nucleus accumbens melanin-concentrating hormone signaling promotes feeding in a sex-specific manner,"Terrill, Sarah J.; Subramanian, Keshav S.; Lan, Rae; Liu, Clarissa M.; Cortella, Alyssa M.; Noble, Emily E.; Kanoski, Scott E.","Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta that increases food intake. The neuronal pathways and behavioral mechanisms mediating the orexigenic effects of MCH are poorly understood, as is the extent to which MCH-mediated feeding outcomes are sex-dependent. Here we investigate the hypothesis that MCH-producing neurons act in the nucleus accumbens shell (ACBsh) to promote feeding behavior and motivation for palatable food in a sex-dependent manner. We utilized ACBsh MCH receptor (MCH1R)-directed pharmacology as well as a dual virus chemogenetic approach to selectively activate MCH neurons that project to the ACBsh. Results reveal that both ACBsh MCH1R activation and activating ACBsh-projecting MCH neurons increase consumption of standard chow and palatable sucrose in male rats without affecting motivated operant responding for sucrose, general activity levels, or anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, food intake was not affected in female rats by either ACBsh MCH1R activation or ACBsh-projecting MCH neuron activation. To determine a mechanism for this sexual dimorphism, we investigated whether the orexigenic effect of ACBsh MCH1R activation is reduced by endogenous estradiol signaling. In ovariectomized female rats on a cyclic regimen of either estradiol (EB) or oil vehicle, ACBsh MCH1R activation increased feeding only in oil-treated rats, suggesting that EB attenuates the ability of ACBsh MCH signaling to promote food intake. Collective results show that MCH ACBsh signaling promotes feeding in an estrogen- and sex-dependent manner, thus identifying novel neurobiological mechanisms through which MCH and female sex hormones interact to influence food intake.

Perceptions of gender and race equality in leadership and advancement among military family physicians,"Massaquoi, Mariama A.; Reese, Tyler R.; Barrett, John; Nguyen, Dana","Introduction: There is increasing interest in assessing gender and race-based disparities in academic medicine and healthcare leadership in civilian medicine and the U.S. Military Health System. Approximately 15% of U.S. active duty service members are women, and racial minorities are 30% of the total active duty force. This study evaluates the following factors among uniformed services family physicians: gender and race representation in attaining early career leadership positions during training and 2 years postresidency; perceptions regarding leadership opportunities and career advancement. Methods: Registered attendees (n = 300) of the 2016 Uniformed Services Academy of Family Physicians Annual Meeting were given a voluntary and anonymous online questionnaire. The main outcomes measured were early leadership assignments and perceptions about command/leadership support, gender roles in leadership assignment, confidence to achieve leadership goals, and being passed over for leadership positions. Results: Sixty-eight percent of registered attendees completed the study questionnaire. Statistically significant results, adjusting for service, grade, race, and gender, were that non-Caucasian family physicians were less likely to be chief residents (odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.01-1.00) and less likely to have leadership positions within 2 years postresidency (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.91). Female family physicians were more likely to agree that gender has a role in assigning leadership positions (odds ratio 2.33, 95% CI 1.01-5.39). There were no differences in perceptions of command support for leadership; confidence in achieving desired leadership level; or in being passed over for leadership positions. Conclusions: This study provides important information about perceived gender and race equality among uniformed services family physicians.

Presence of same-sex kin promotes explorative behavior in subadult cichlid fish,"Vitt, Simon; Madge Pimentel, Iris; Thünken, Timo","While the importance of kin discrimination, that is, kin recognition and subsequent differential treatment of kin and nonkin, is well established for kin-directed cooperation or altruism, the role of kin discrimination in the context of kin competition and kin avoidance is largely unexplored. Theory predicts that individuals avoiding competition with kin should be favored by natural selection due to indirect fitness benefits. Using an experimental approach, we investigated whether the presence of same-sex kin affects avoidance and explorative behavior in subadult Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a West African cichlid fish with strong intrasexual competition in both sexes. Pelvicachromis taeniatus is capable of recognizing kin using phenotype matching and shows kin discrimination in diverse contexts. When exposed to a same-sex conspecific, both males and females tended to interact less with the related opponent. Moreover, individuals explored a novel environment faster after exposure to kin than to nonkin. This effect was more pronounced in females. Individuals avoiding the proximity of same-sex relatives may reduce kin competition over resources such as mating partners or food.

Promoting concern about gender bias with evidence-based confrontation,"Parker, Laura R.; Monteith, Margo J.; Moss-Racusin, Corinne A.; Van Camp, Amanda R.","Whereas confrontations of racial bias prompt negative self-directed affect (e.g., guilt) and reduce bias, confrontations of gender bias are typically disregarded. We examined the effectiveness of an evidence-based confrontation in which participants received concrete evidence of their discriminatory gender-biased evaluations. Participants were confronted with evidence that they evaluated a female applicant for a lab manager position negatively, which would have resulted in her not being hired, and that their evaluations were more negative than an otherwise identical applicant who was male. Experiment 1 found that this confrontation activated greater guilt and, in turn, concern about expressing and regulating gender bias in the future (hereafter 'future concern'), relative to participants who were confronted about gender bias but without concrete evidence of bias. Experiment 2 showed that confrontation with concrete evidence of gender bias activated guilt and future concern whether the bias was framed as viewing women as not belonging in science or as unintelligent. Experiment 3 showed that the positive effects of confronting gender bias with evidence were just as strong as a parallel confrontation of racial bias. Experiment 4 showed that the positive effects also held in a non-STEM domain, and that these effects were not dependent on the situational salience of norms opposing gender bias. Thus, a robust strategy for effective confrontation of gender bias was established. However, we discuss difficulties with implementing this strategy in many real world situations, along with implications for how best to curb gender bias through confrontation.

"Promoting equitable sexual health communication among patients with minoritized racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender identities: Strategies, challenges, and opportunities","Noh, Madeline; Hughto, Jaclyn M. W.; Austin, S. Bryn; Goldman, Roberta E.; Potter, Jennifer; Agénor, Madina","People assigned female at birth (AFAB) with minoritized racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender identities experience notable barriers to high-quality sexual healthcare. In confronting these barriers, patient-provider communication can be a crucial factor, influencing patients' experiences and access to relevant sexual health information and services by determining the quality of care. However, research that investigates this communication among AFAB patients with minoritized social positions is scarce, indicating a research gap regarding the perspectives and roles of healthcare providers in addressing such barriers to care for minoritized patients. Thus, we conducted a qualitative research study, using individual in-depth interviews, to explore the multi-level factors that influence providers' attitudes, knowledge, and skills regarding sexual health communication with AFAB patients with minoritized racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender identities. Interpreting study findings within frameworks of person-centered care, intersectionality, and structural competency, we identified three cross-cutting themes. We found that providers frequently drew on their prior professional training, personal lived experiences, and population-level health disparities data when engaging in sexual health communication with minoritized AFAB patients. Participants reported minimal explicit training in anti-racist and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+)-competent care as a significant barrier to engaging in equitable sexual health communication with minoritized AFAB patients, which was exacerbated by many providers’ lack of shared social positions and lived experiences with these patients. Providers also frequently applied population-level data to individual patients when formulating counseling and recommendations, which may undermine person-centered sexual health communication. Our findings suggest that critical anti-racist and LGBTQ+-competent provider training is urgently needed, and that health professional education and institutions must be transformed to better reflect and consider the experiences of patients with minoritized racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender identities.

Promoting gender equality in a challenging environment: The case of Scandinavian subsidiaries in Japan,"Kemper, Lena Elisabeth; Bader, Anna Katharina; Froese, Fabian Jintae","Purpose: Gender diversity and equality vary tremendously among countries. This is a particular challenge for foreign subsidiaries, when the level of gender diversity and equality differs between the home and host country. Various indicators such as a low-gender pay gap or a high ratio of females in managerial positions suggest that Scandinavia is ahead in terms of gender diversity and equality, whereas those indicators suggest that the level in Japan is currently lower. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how executives leading Scandinavian subsidiaries operating in Japan perceive this situation, and whether and what kind of actions they take to initiate change. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a qualitative analysis of 20 in-depth interviews with executives of Scandinavian subsidiaries in Japan. Findings: Findings reveal that executives of Scandinavian subsidiaries respond to the major differences in gender equality between Scandinavia and Japan with three strategies of change: resistance and rigid change, compromise and moderate change, and adaptation and maintaining status quo. Moreover, the findings indicate that the strategy of change varies depending on individual differences of the executives, e.g., nationality, and organizational differences, e.g., subsidiary size. Research limitations/implications: Due to the small sample size, the generalizability of the findings is limited. Given the paucity of research on this topic, this approach provides first insights for building a basis for future studies. Originality/value: This study contributes to the scarce literature on gender diversity and equality in multinational enterprises by identifying strategies of how gender equality can be fostered in a non-Western context from a top executive perspective.

Promoting gender equality: A systematic review of interventions,"Guthridge, Michaela; Kirkman, Maggie; Penovic, Tania; Giummarra, Melita J.","More than four decades have passed since the United Nation’s Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) was adopted. Now is an opportune time to consider whether the interventions seeking to realise CEDAW’s aspirations have brought us closer to achieving gender equality. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesise evidence for the effectiveness of social justice, cognitive, or behaviour-change interventions that sought to reduce gender inequality, gender bias, or discrimination against women or girls. Interventions could be implemented in any context, with any mode of delivery and duration, if they measured gender equity or discrimination outcomes, and were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Papers on violence against women and sexuality were not eligible. Seventy-eight papers reporting qualitative (n = 36), quantitative (n = 23), and multi-methods (n = 19) research projects met the eligibility criteria after screening 7,832 citations identified from psycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus searches, reference lists and expert recommendations. Findings were synthesised narratively. Improved gender inclusion was the most frequently reported change (n = 39), particularly for education and media interventions. Fifty percent of interventions measuring social change in gender equality did not achieve beneficial effects. Most gender mainstreaming interventions had only partial beneficial effects on outcomes, calling into question their efficacy in practice. Twenty-eight interventions used education and awareness-raising strategies, which also predominantly had only partial beneficial effects. Overall research quality was low to moderate, and the key findings created doubt that interventions to date have achieved meaningful change. Interventions may not have achieved macrolevel change because they did not explicitly address meso and micro change. We conclude with a summary of the evidence for key determinants of the promotion of gender equality, including a call to address men’s emotional responses (micro) in the process of achieving gender equality (micro/meso/macrolevels).

Methods: One hundred and forty-three Chinese American women who were currently nonadherent to guidelines for receiving annual screening mammograms were randomly assigned to read either a gain- or loss-framed culturally appropriate print brochure about mammography screening. Mammography screening was self-reported at a 2-month follow-up. Results: Although there was not a main effect for message frame, the hypothesized interaction between message frame and decisional balance was significant, indicating that women who received a framed message that matched their decisional balance were significantly more likely to have obtained a mammogram by the follow-up than women who received a mismatched message. Conclusions: Results suggest that decisional balance, and more generally, perceptions about mammography, may be an important moderator of framing effects for mammography among Chinese American women. Practice implications: The match between message frame and decisional balance should be considered when attempting to encourage Chinese American women to receive mammography screening, as a match between the two may be most persuasive.

Keawe","A growing body of evidence links stress with mental illness and chronic disease. Existing scales of women’s stress fail to capture the daily stressors of low-income, rural women. We explored the psychosocial stressors of local women residing in a rural Hawaii community with a large Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population. We recruited women, aged 18–35 years, at a community health center. We convened four focus groups to elicit information about women’s stress. We identified key themes from the focus group data to generate questions that target concerns raised by participants. These were corroborated by additional focus groups. Thirty-six women participated in the study. Seven stressor themes emerged: intimate relationships—limited partner assistance, gender stereotype; family and home life—feeling like an outsider, lack of respect; childrearing—quality and affordable childcare, conflicting discipline styles; time for self—never-ending duties, being too tired to relax; neighborhood environment—safety concerns, not feeling part of the community; workplace—workload and transportation obstacles; and finances—making ends meet and arguments about money. Women in this study articulated a broad range of daily stressors. Sociocultural factors leading to feeling like an outsider within their own family, intercultural marriage conflicts, and perceptions of community discrimination are not included in other published scales. Our focus group investigations thus provided critical knowledge for developing a community-relevant scale. This is a prerequisite for developing and testing innovative intervention strategies designed to reduce stress in this population. We believe that reducing stress is necessary to mitigate the negative effects of stressors on physical and mental health among women in this rural community.

Promotion of women physicians in academic medicine,"Nocco, Sarah E.; Larson, Allison R.","Women currently represent nearly half of all medical school graduates and assistant professors at academic institutions. Despite the large pool of women in the academic medicine pipeline, relatively few ascend to top leadership positions and women remain grossly underrepresented among full professors, permanent department chairs, and highest-level deans/interim deans. Considerable evidence suggests that the gender imbalance observed at the top tiers of academic medicine is, in part, due to gender differences in promotional rates, with women being promoted more slowly than their male colleagues. The well-documented gender gaps in publications, grant support, recognition awards, speaker invitations, and leadership positions contribute to the slow progression of women in medicine, as promotions committees rely heavily upon these traditional measures of academic success to select candidates for career advancement. Additionally, implicit biases, which have been shown to favor men over women in science and leadership, influence decision-making processes relevant to the promotion of women in academia. With the large number of highly qualified women entering medicine, it is imperative that organizations, academic institutions, and leaders in the medical community address the systemic inequities that are preventing half the workforce from reaching its full potential.

Quantifying intersectionality: An important advancement for health inequality research,"Richman, Laura S.; Zucker, Alyssa N.","Background: Intersectionality is a powerful theoretical framework that is useful in describing the lived experiences of people with multiple marginalized statuses. By focusing on power and domination (e.g., racism, sexism), and the ways in which they are inextricably linked and mutually constructing, researchers can better understand experiences of all people, not just those with one or more master statuses. This framework is valuable in understanding how discrimination relates to health and in attempts to reduce health disparities. Rationale: Population health researchers have only recently begun to consider intersectionality in their theories and measurement (Bowleg, 2012), and have been hindered by the challenges of measuring and analyzing experiences of discrimination in intersectional ways. We need new methodological strategies to enable empirical research to catch up with theoretical advances. Conclusions: The pair of articles in this issue by Scheim and Bauer (2019), and Bauer and Scheim (2019), offer important new data collection instruments and data analytic strategies to advance our ability to measure discrimination intersectionally. When using these new tools, it is important to not lose track of the origins and historical underpinnings of intersectionality and to focus on the transformative goal of intersectionality to eradicate inequality.

Methods: From 2015 to 2016, women aged 13–24 years presenting to five Northern California family planning clinics were surveyed about their STI prevention strategies. The chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression identified associations between race/ethnicity and use of sexual health-promoting strategies. Results: Among 790 women, the most common strategies included condom use (67%), asking partners about STIs (47%), limiting sexual partners (35%), frequent STI screening (35%), and asking partners about other sexual partners (33%). Black, Hispanic, and Asian women had decreased odds of utilizing strategies before intercourse compared with white women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]black: .25, confidence interval [.14–.47]; aORHispanic: .36, CI [.20–.65]; aORAsian: .44, CI [.23–.84]).

L.; Hamilton, Ian M.; Aubin-Horth, Nadia; Bernier, Nicholas J.; Balshine, Sigal","Individuals that live in groups experience different challenges based on their social rank and sex. Glucocorticoids have a well-established role in coordinating responses to challenges and glucocorticoid levels often vary between ranks and sexes. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating glucocorticoid dynamics in wild groups are poorly understood, making it difficult to determine the functional consequences of differences in glucocorticoid levels. Therefore, we observed wild social groups of a cooperatively breeding fish (Neolamprologus pulcher) and evaluated how scale cortisol content (an emerging method to evaluate cortisol dynamics in fishes) and expression of glucocorticoid-related genes varied across group members. Scale cortisol was detectable in ~50% of dominant males (7/17) and females (7/15)—but not in any subordinates (0/16)—suggesting that glucocorticoid levels were higher in dominants. However, the apparent behavioural and neuroendocrine factors regulating cortisol levels varied between dominant sexes. In dominant females, higher cortisol was associated with greater rates of territory defense and increased expression of corticotropin-releasing factor in the preoptic and hypothalamic regions of the brain, but these patterns were not observed in dominant males. Additionally, transcriptional differences in the liver suggest that dominant sexes may use different mechanisms to cope with elevated cortisol levels. While dominant females appeared to reduce the relative sensitivity of their liver to cortisol (fewer corticosteroid receptor transcripts), dominant males appeared to increase hepatic cortisol breakdown (more catabolic enzyme transcripts). Overall, our results offer valuable insights on the mechanisms regulating rank- and sex-based glucocorticoid dynamics, as well as the potential functional outcomes of these differences.

"Recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine: How institutions are addressing gender disparities","Carr, Phyllis L.; Gunn, Christine; Raj, Anita; Kaplan, Samantha; Freund, Karen M.","Objective: Greater numbers of women in medicine have not resulted in more women achieving senior positions. Programs supporting the recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine could help to achieve greater advancement of more women to leadership positions. Qualitative research was conducted to understand such programs at 23 institutions and, using the social ecological model, examine how they operate at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels. Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted with faculty representatives (n = 44) of the Group on Women in Medicine and Science, Diversity and Inclusion, or senior leaders with knowledge on gender climate in 24 medical schools. Four trained interviewers conducted semistructured interviews that addressed faculty perceptions of gender equity and advancement, which were audiotaped and transcribed. The data were categorized into three content areas—recruitment, promotion, and retention—and coded a priori for each area based on their social ecological level of operation. Findings: Participants from nearly 40% of the institutions reported no special programs for recruiting, promoting, or retaining women, largely describing such programming as unnecessary. Existing programs primarily targeted the individual and interpersonal levels simultaneously, via training, mentoring, and networking, or the institutional level, via search committee trainings, child and elder care, and spousal hiring programs. Lesser effort at the academic community and policy levels were described. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that many U.S. medical schools have no programs supporting gender equity among medical faculty. Existing programs primarily target the individual or interpersonal level of the social ecological interaction.

Relationship tenure differentially influences pair‐bond behavior in male and female socially monogamous titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus),"Rothwell, Emily S.; Carp, Sarah B.; Savidge, Logan E.; Mendoza, Sally P.; Bales, Karen L.","Pair‐bonded primates have uniquely enduring relationships and partners engage in a suite of behaviors to maintain these close bonds. In titi monkeys, pair bond formation has been extensively studied, but changes across relationship tenure remain unstudied. We evaluated differences in behavioral indicators of pair bonding in newly formed (~6 months paired, n = 9) compared to well‐established pairs (average 3 years paired, n = 8) of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) as well as sex differences within the pairs. We hypothesized that overall males would contribute more to maintenance than females, but that the pattern of maintenance behaviors would differ between newly formed and well‐established pairs. Each titi monkey (N = 34) participated in a partner preference test (PPT), where the subject was placed in a middle test cage with grated windows separating the subject from the partner on one side and an opposite‐sex stranger on the other side. During this 150‐min behavioral test, we quantified four key behaviors: time in proximity to the partner or stranger as well as aggressive displays toward the partner or stranger. Overall, we found different behavioral profiles representing newly formed and well‐established pair‐bond relationships in titi monkeys and male‐biased relationship maintenance. Males spent ∼40% of their time in the PPT maintaining proximity to the female partner, regardless of relationship tenure. Males from well‐established bonds spent less time (14%) near the female stranger compared to males from newly formed bonds (21%) at the trend level. In contrast, females from well‐established bonds spent less (23%) time near the male partner in the PPT compared to females from newly formed bonds (47%). Aggressive displays were more frequent in newly formed bonds compared to well‐established bonds, especially for females.

Here, we examined transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the ERα promoter, in which ERα-expressing cells in the brain can be visualized by GFP. Fluorescence microscopy revealed the existence of many GFP-expressing cells in the medial preoptic area, medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and striohypothalamic nucleus (StHy) of adult transgenic mice. Neuronal nuclear antigen, a neuron marker, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte marker, was mostly expressed by GFP-expressing cells. Analysis of GFP expression area showed that adult females had higher GFP expression in a region including the ventral part of the BNST, StHy, and dorsal part of the MPN than in adult males. Such female-biased sex difference was also found in transgenic pups on postnatal day 5 and 8. The GFP expression area of adult females was decreased by postnatal treatment with testosterone or estradiol. These results indicate that GFP visualizes a sex difference of ERα-expressing neurons. The transgenic mice may be useful for the analysis of the sexual differentiation of the brain.

"Sex differences in depression, anxiety and health-promoting lifestyles among community residents: A network approach","Zheng, Ziwei; Zhao, Wenqing; Zhou, Qing; Yang, Yang; Chen, Shuangyi; Hu, Jun; Jiang, Wenhui; Zhang, Weibo; Cai, Jun; Qiu, Jianyin","Background: Researchers have studied sex differences in typical depressive and anxiety symptoms and their cooccurrence. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a mental health promotion objective that suggests considering protective health-promoting factors when developing strategies for preventing mental disorders between sexes. From a network perspective, psychopathology is viewed as a result of interacting symptoms and influential factors. This study adopted network approach to investigate sex differences in health-promoting lifestyles (HPL) and the cooccurrence symptoms of communities in Shanghai. The aim is to provide health-promoting suggestions on better enhancing the life quality for community members. Methods: Depression, anxiety symptoms, and HPL were assessed with PHQ-9, GAD-7 and HPLP-II scales in 2420 adults (1411 females). Networks were constructed by Gaussian Graphical Models and the networks of two sexes using the Network Comparison Test. Results: Females scored significantly higher on PHQ-9 (p < 0.001) and GAD-7 (p < 0.001), and no differences were found between the two sexes in HPL scores. Restlessness and low energy yielded the highest strength centrality in the female network, while suicide ideation and restlessness were central in male network. Regarding protective HPL, physical activity and stress management were identified as the central mental health-promoting behaviours in female and male network, respectively. However, stress management was positively related to suicide ideation in the male network. Conclusion: Communities should be aware of suicide ideation in males because of its high relationships with other symptoms and also provide stress management courses, especially for males. As for women, chronic energy deficiency deserves more attention for its high probability of cooccurrence with other symptoms in the network. Also, advocating physical activities may be particularly beneficial for the overall mental health among women. Future study should collect time-series data and analyze intraindividual networks to specify personalized health promoting strategies for each individual.

Sex differences in rhesus monkeys’ digit ratio (2D:4D ratio) and its association with maternal social dominance rank,"Baxter, Alexander; Wood, Elizabeth K.; Jarman, Parker; Cameron, Ashley N.; Capitanio, John P.; Higley, J. Dee","Prenatal androgen exposure (PAE) plays a pivotal role in masculinizing the developing body and brain, and extreme exposure may contribute to autism, anxiety disorder and schizophrenia. One commonly used biomarker for PAE is the pointer-to-ring-finger digit length (2D:4D) ratio. Although this biomarker is widely used in human studies, relatively few studies have investigated 2D:4D ratio in nonhuman primates, particularly rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), one of the most commonly used animals in biomedical research. Thus far, data suggest that sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D ratio may be in the opposite direction in some monkey species, when compared to the pattern exhibited by humans and great apes. Using a large sample size, we investigated whether rhesus monkeys’ 2D:4D ratio shows the same sex-differentiated pattern present in other Old World monkey species. We also investigated whether individual differences in 2D:4D ratio are associated with the social dominance rank of subjects’ mothers during pregnancy, and the social dominance rank the subjects attained as adults. Subjects were 335 rhesus monkeys between 3 years and 24 years of age (M = 6.6). Maternal dominance rank during pregnancy and subjects’ adult dominance rank were categorized into tertiles (high, middle and low). Results showed that, across both hands, male rhesus monkeys exhibited higher 2D:4D ratio than females, a pattern consistent with other monkey species and a reversal from the pattern typically observed in humans and apes. This sex difference was modulated by maternal dominance rank, with female offspring of high-ranking and middle-ranking mothers exhibiting masculinized 2D:4D ratio, indicating that maternal dominance rank during pregnancy may influence levels of PAE. There was no association between subjects’ 2D:4D ratio and the social dominance rank they attained as adults. These findings show a consistent sex difference in Old World monkeys’ 2D:4D ratio that diverges from the pattern observed in apes and humans, and suggest maternal social dominance rank modulates PAE in rhesus monkeys.

Strengthening our schools to promote resilience and health among LGBTQ youth: Emerging evidence and research priorities from The State of LGBTQ Youth Health and Wellbeing symposium,"Johns, Michelle M.; Poteat, V. Paul; Horn, Stacey S.; Kosciw, Joseph","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents face well-documented health disparities in suicide risk, substance use, and sexual health. These disparities are known to stem, in part, from stigma directed toward LGBTQ youth in the form of minority stressors such as violence, discrimination, and harassment. Given the proportion of time that LGBTQ students spend in school, schools provide a critical context within which protective factors may be developed and leveraged to improve the health and wellbeing of these populations. This article provides a summary of key findings from a discussion among researchers, practitioners, and community members who participated in 'The State of LGBTQ Youth Health and Wellbeing: Strengthening Schools and Families to Build Resilience,' a public symposium held in June 2017. We detail emerging science on and future priorities for school-based research with LGBTQ youth which were identified by attendees at this meeting, with a particular focus on intersectionality, supportive adults in schools, and in-school programs. We call for more school-based research on priority gaps such as how LGBTQ students' intersecting identities affect their in-school experiences, how to design professional development programs that cultivate supportive educators, and how to leverage gay–straight alliances/gender and sexuality alliances as sites of health programming for LGBTQ students.

The influence of ovarian hormones on the putative mechanisms that promote female nicotine use,"Giner, Priscilla; Ortegon, Sebastian; Bagdas, Deniz; O'Dell, Laura E.","Nicotine use is driven by pleasurable effects, but following chronic exposure, nicotine use becomes largely driven by the desire need to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Current cessation strategies focusing on alleviating withdrawal, but current cessation interventions are less effective for women than men. Also, hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle appear to impact use patterns, withdrawal severity, and treatment efficacy. This raises important questions regarding optimal quit dates and the application of hormone interventions to alleviate withdrawal in women. This review surveys the existing literature assessing the impact of ovarian hormones on nicotine withdrawal severity. This is an important issue because women seeking cessation treatments may be using hormone-based contraceptives or hormone replacement post-menopause. Hormone interventions may also offer a novel treatment avenue that is more effective than current cessation approaches. Future work in this area is important for reducing health disparities produced by excessive nicotine use in women.

The stress response and exploratory behaviour in Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrofa): Relations to sex and social rank,"Adcock, Sarah J. J.; Martin, Gerard M.; Walsh, Carolyn J.","According to the coping styles hypothesis, an individual demonstrates an integrated behavioural and physiological response to environmental challenge that is consistent over timeand across situations. Individual consistency in behavioural responses to challenge has been documented across the animal kingdom. Comparatively fewstudies, however, have examined inter-individual variation in the physiological response, namely glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels, the stress hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively. Variation in coping styles between individuals may be explained in part by differences in social rank and sex. Using 20 Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrofa) we: (1) investigated the existence of consistent inter-individual variation in exploratory behaviour and the hormonal stress response, and tested for correlations as predicted by the coping styles hypothesis; and (2) evaluated whether inter-individual behavioural and hormonal variation is related to social rank and sex. Salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase, chromogranin A) were assessed in the presence and absence of a stressor consisting of social isolation in a crate for 10 min. Principal components analysis on a set of behavioural variables revealed two traits, which we labelled exploratory tendency and neophobia. Neither exploratory tendency nor neophobia predicted the physiological stress response. Subordinate pigs exhibited higher catecholamine levels compared to dominant conspecifics. We observed sex differences in the repeatability of salivary stress markers and reactivity of the stress systems. The results do not provide support for the existence of behavioural–physiological coping styles in pigs. Sex is an important determinant of the physiological stress response and warrants consideration in research addressing behavioural and hormonal variation.

The variables associated with health promotion behaviors among urban Black women,"Hepburn, Millie","Purpose: To improve understanding of variables impacting health promotion behaviors among urban Black women. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was used. Urban Black women (N = 132) between the ages of 30 to 64 years participated. Setting: The study was conducted in a U.S. metropolitan region in 2015. Measures: Health literacy (Newest Vital Sign [NVS]), self-efficacy (New General Self-Efficacy Scale [NGSE]), and readiness for change (Health Risk Instrument [HRI]) were correlated with health promotion behaviors (Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II [HPLPII]). Analysis: Univariate statistics addressed demographic characteristics; bivariate/simultaneous linear regression determined the relationships between the NVS, NGSE, and HRI to health promotion behaviors (HPLPII). Results: Demographics: 72.6% completed high school and 25% completed college, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was > 32. Positive correlations existed between each variable to health promotion behaviors: NVS (r = .244, p < .002), NGSE (r = .312, p < .001), HRI (r = .440, p < .001), and accounted for 29.8% of variances in health promotion behaviors. Education and health literacy were also correlated (rs = .414, p = .001). Conclusions: Although health literacy, self-efficacy, and readiness for change are associated with health promotion behaviors, readiness for change was the most highly correlated. Clinical Relevance: The development and incorporation of interventions to promote health promotion behaviors should include readiness for change, health literacy, BMI, and education, especially among urban Black women in order to reduce critical health disparities. Community-based and culturally relevant strategies in promoting health that are integrated into existing lifestyles and designed to impact readiness for change will have the greatest impact on reducing health disparities both in the United States and in countries experiencing rapid urbanization. For example, healthy eating behaviors or increased physical activity may be best adopted when integrated into existing community-based spiritual or cultural events via trusted community leaders. Replication of this study in other populations of Black women will improve the generalizability of this study, both in the United States and globally. However, the addition of other demographic variables, such as a history of chronic conditions, military service, domestic or other violence, spirituality, and the availability of community resources, would strengthen the results in future studies.

Methods: To reach the target population we utilized a passive dissemination strategy. Using Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) as a framework, we traced dissemination of the brochure over a five year period using self-addressed postcards contained inside the brochure that included several open-ended questions about the utility of the brochure, and a field for written comments. Closed-ended responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses.

K.; Cant, Michael A.","Ecological conditions are expected to have an important influence on individuals’ investment in cooperative care. However, the nature of their effects is unclear: both favorable and unfavorable conditions have been found to promote helping behavior. Recent studies provide a possible explanation for these conflicting results by suggesting that increased ecological variability, rather than changes in mean conditions, promote cooperative care. However, no study has tested whether increased ecological variability promotes individual- level helping behavior or the mechanisms involved. We test this hypothesis in a long-term study population of the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, using 14 years of behavioral and meteorological data to explore how the mean and variability of ecological conditions influence individual behavior, body condition, and survival. Female body condition was more sensitive to changes in rainfall leading to poorer female survival and pronounced male-biased group compositions after periods of high rainfall variability. After such periods, older males invested more in helping behavior, potentially because they had fewer mating opportunities. These results provide the first empirical evidence for increased individual helping effort in more variable ecological conditions and suggest this arises because of individual differences in the effect of ecological conditions on body condition and survival, and the knock-on effect on social group composition. Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental variability, and the impacts this has on the internal structure and composition of animal groups, can exert a strong influence on the evolution and maintenance of social behaviors, such as cooperative care.

"Variation in inhibitory control does not influence social rank, foraging efficiency, or risk taking, in red junglefowl females","Garnham, Laura Clare; Boddington, Robert; Løvlie, Hanne","Individual variation in cognition, seen in many taxa, is not well understood, despite its potential evolutionary consequences. Inhibitory control is an aspect of cognition which differs between individuals. However, how selection could act on this variation remains unclear. First, individual consistency over time of behaviours affected by inhibitory control, and how these behaviours relate to each other, is not well understood. Second, consequences in ecologically relevant contexts of variation in behaviours affected by inhibitory control, are scarcely investigated. Therefore, we explored the temporal consistency and inter-relatedness of two behaviours influenced by inhibitory control (impulsive action and persistence) and how these link to social rank, foraging efficiency, and risk taking in adult female red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). We measured impulsive action in a detour test, and persistence in both a detour test and a foraging test. Impulsive action and persistence, measured in a detour test, were moderately consistent over time, and positively correlated. This implies that selection could act on inhibitory control via these behaviours, and selection on one behaviour could affect the other. However, we found no evidence of links between inhibitory control and social rank, foraging efficiency, or risk taking. This implies that selection may not act on inhibitory control via these measures, and that, in general, there may be a lack of strong selection on inhibitory control. This, in turn, could help explain individual variation in this aspect of cognition. Future research should explore the specificity of when inhibitory control has implications for individuals, and continue to investigate how variation in cognitive traits influences how individuals behave in contexts with potential evolutionary implications.

The coronavirus pandemic has led to the rapid rise in videoconferencing in professional interactions; however, little is known about videoconferencing etiquette and how gender bias permeates to this new setting. Although there are many benefits to the use of this technology, it has the potential to reinforce gender bias rooted in cultural and societal norms, gender stereotypes, and traditional gender roles.

Hence, we interviewed 25 tenured STEM professors in Germany about which attributes they personally consider to be required pre- versus post-tenure and analyzed whether these attributes are associated with gender stereotypes. We found that different attributes are mentioned in the pre- versus the post-tenure career stage and that the required attributes can be associated with gender stereotypes: While agentic–stereotypically male–attributes were mentioned more frequently than communal attributes in the pre-tenure career stage, communal–stereotypically female–attributes were reported slightly more often than agentic attributes after reaching tenure.

Women or LARC first? Reproductive autonomy and the promotion of long‐acting reversible contraceptive methods,"Gomez, Anu Manchikanti; Fuentes, Liza; Allina, Amy","This Viewpoint column discusses reproductive autonomy and the promotion of long‐acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods. To fully realize the promise of LARC methods to support reproductive autonomy and health for women, we must also consider that the promotion and uptake of any contraceptive technology takes place in social and political contexts that historically and currently subjugate low income women and women of color-those most likely to experience unintended pregnancy. Such a discussion by no means diminishes the tremendous importance of continuing to eliminate structural and clinical barriers to LARC use; indeed, it can highlight issues, such as insurance coverage for IUD removal, that are not always recognized as concerns. One can increase women's ability to prevent and plan pregnancies by ensuring that as one devise solutions that eliminate barriers to LARC use for all women, one do not inadvertently diminish the reproductive autonomy of some women.

Sex Disparity Among Faculty of Physiology in North American Academia: Differences in Scholarly Productivity and Academic Rank,"Ahmad, I; Khan, NU","Medical academic research done in various specialties shows sex disparity in terms of academic and leadership rank. Research shows that in many medical academic research fields, there are a greater number of men with higher academic and leadership ranks, as well as higher research productivity. This begs the question: What is the case for medical academic research specifically in physiology departments throughout North America? Upon review of the literature, we found that a knowledge gap still exists in North America regarding sex differences among the faculty of physiology. Our rationale for this study is that if a sex disparity among the faculty of physiology in North American academia is found, steps can be taken to lower this disparity. The very first step is identifying that a problem exists. Scopus was used to obtain the h-index, years of active research, and the number of publications and citations of each faculty member. The h-index was used as a metric of academic output and scholarly productivity. Univariate regression was run with the h-index as the outcome of interest and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with a higher h-index. The analysis showed that while the overall number of females holding academic positions in physiology departments throughout North America has increased over the years, a large sex disparity still exists between males and females in the field. This disparity exists not only in academic and leadership rank but also in research productivity, a key predictor of success in the field. This finding warrants that further work be done to find what is causing this disparity and how it can be addressed.",2020,,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,12,12,,WOS:000595239400014,10.7759/cureus.11850,,#488,Ahmad 2020,"",""

Sex Disparity Among Canadian Cardiologists in Academic Medicine: Differences in Scholarly Productivity and Academic Rank,"Rano, J; Jalal, S; Sedlak, T; Butler, J; Khan, MS; Manning, WJ; Khosa, F","BackgroundWomen remain relatively underrepresented in all subspecialties of academic medicine. While sex disparity is prevalent in a number of specialties, the association between academic productivity and sex in academic cardiology has not been assessed in the Canadian context.MethodsAcademic faculty of accredited Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) programs were included from cardiology division websites across 17 universities. Cardiology faculty members' names, academic ranks, leadership positions, and sex were obtained from each institutions' website. The Elsevier database Scopus (c) was used to extract the Hirsch index (H-index), years of active research, and number of publications of each faculty member. The H-index was used as a metric of academic output and research productivity. Univariate regression was run with the H-Index as the outcome of interest, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with higher H-index.ResultsSex was identified for 1,040 members, of whom 836 (80%) were male. Male members had higher numbers of publications (p<0.001). There was a trend for males in a leadership position to have a higher H-index (p = 0.07). Median H-index was lower for women (p = 0.02). Males across assistant and associate professor ranks had a higher H-index. Women achieving professor rank demonstrated greater productivity with a higher median H-index (p = 0.002).ConclusionsThere is a prevalent sex gap in academic cardiology with regard to scholarly productivity and academic achievement.

Prior studies of advancement disparities have been predominantly quantitative, utilizing large physician databases or surveys. We used qualitative methods to explore ID physicians' experiences and beliefs about causes and ways to mitigate gender inequities in advancement.Methods We conducted semistructured focus group discussions with academic ID physicians in the United States at IDWeek 2019 to explore perceived barriers and facilitators to academic advancement. Participants were assigned to focus groups based on their academic rank and gender. We analyzed focus group transcripts using content analysis to summarize emergent themes.Results We convened 3 women-only focus groups (1 for instructors/assistant professors, 1 for associate professors, and 1 for full professors) and 1 men-only focus group of full professors (total N = 50). Our analyses identified several major themes on barriers to equitable academic advancement, including (1) interpersonal and institutional gender bias, (2) difficulty balancing the demands of family life with work life, and (3) gender differences in negotiation strategies.Conclusions Barriers to gender equity in academic advancement are myriad and enduring and span the professional and personal lives of ID physicians. In addition to swift enactment of policy changes directed at critical issues such as ending workplace harassment and ensuring adequate parental leaves for birth and nonbirth parents, leaders in academic medicine must shine a bright light on biases within the system at large and within themselves to correct these disparities with the urgency required.Quantitative data repeatedly show a gender gap in academic advancement in ID.

Publish <i>and</i> Perish? An Assessment of Gender Gaps in Promotion to Tenure in Academia,"Weisshaar, K","In academia, there remains a gender gap in promotion to tenure, such that men are more likely to receive tenure than women. This paper tests three explanations of this gender gap in promotion: (1) contextual and organizational differences across departments; (2) performance/productivity differences by gender; and (3) gendered inequality in evaluation. To test these explanations, this project uses a novel dataset drawing from a sample of assistant professors in Sociology, Computer Science, and English, across research universities. This dataset combines data from sources including curriculum vitae, Google Scholar, and web archive employment data, resulting in a dataset of assistant professors' publication records, department affiliations, and job positions. Analyses examine the gender gap in the likelihood of promotion to tenure and in early career trajectories, while accounting for publication productivity and department/university context. The results demonstrate that productivity measures account for a portion of the gender gap in tenure, but in each discipline a substantial share of the gender gap remains unexplained by these factors. Department characteristics do not explain the tenure gender gap. Further, when women do receive tenure, they do so in lower-prestige departments than men, on average. These findings suggest that gendered inequality in the tenure evaluation process contributes to the gender gap in tenure rates.",2017,,SOCIAL FORCES,96,2,529-560,WOS:000422834900004,10.1093/sf/sox052,,#496,Weisshaar 2017,"",""

Defining Barriers and Facilitators to Advancement for Women in Academic Surgery,"Thompson-Burdine, JA; Telem, DA; Waljee, JF; Newman, EA; Coleman, DM; Stoll, HI; Sandhu, G","IMPORTANCE Sex equity is elusive in academic surgery departments across the United States. Persistent inequities remain a considerable problem and inhibit professional advancement for female surgeons. Identifying the factors that promulgate sex discrepancies may provide a framework for institutional growth and personal progress for women.OBJECTIVE To identify barriers and facilitators to success at the individual and organizational level to develop evidence-based interventions designed to close the sex gap in surgery.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study included 26 female participants who were current and former surgical faculty employed by Michigan Medicine, the health system of the University of Michigan, between 2000 and 2017. Semistructured personal interviews were conducted from June 28 to September 29, 2017, via telephone. Each interview lasted 45 minutes to 1 hour. Interviews were recorded and then transcribed for analysis.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The interview included 7 questions referring to the surgeon's experience with the Michigan Medicine Department of Surgery and 7 questions referring to nonspecific areas of interest.RESULTS The 26 participants in this study ranged in age from 32 to 64 years, with faculty experience ranging from 3 to 22 years. Thematic analysis was used to locate, analyze, and report patterns within the data related to barriers and facilitators for women in academic medicine. Three major themes were identified by researchers. Participants reported that (1) organizational culture and institutional policies affect opportunities for advancement; (2) relational interactions with leadership, mentors, colleagues, and staff affect promotion and attrition; and (3) individual characteristics mediate the perception of professional and personal success.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study of 26 female academic surgeons, a complex matrix of organizational and individual factors were found to contribute to sex inequities in academic surgery.

The Perception and Experience of Gender-Based Discrimination Related to Professional Advancement among Japanese Physicians,"Yasukawa, K; Nomura, K","Previous studies from the US have found that female physicians often experience gender-based discrimination related to professional advancement. In Japan, female physicians are underrepresented in leadership positions but little is known about the prevalence of gender discrimination. We investigated the perception and prevalence of gender-based career obstacles and discrimination among Japanese physicians. The study was based on surveys of alumnae from 13 medical schools and alumni from 3 medical schools. In total, 1,684 female and 808 male physicians completed a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 83% and 58%). More women than men had the perception of gender-based career obstacles for women (77% vs. 55%; p < 0.0001). Women with part-time positions were more likely to have the perception of gender-based career obstacles than women working full-time (OR 1.32, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.73).

Medical school research ranking is associated with gender inequality in MSTP application rates,"Bowen, CJ; Kersbergen, CJ; Tang, O; Cox, A; Beach, MC","Background: The number of female trainees in MD and biomedical PhD programs has reached near parity with their male counterparts for several years. However, a gender disparity persists for enrollment in Medical Scientist Research Programs (MSTPs). Several studies suggest women underestimate their abilities compared with male colleagues. If this phenomenon applies, we might expect there to be a gender disparity in applicants to MSTPs, which are typically considered more competitive compared to MD or PhD programs. In this report, we explored this hypothesis by evaluating whether female applicants who do apply to MSTP programs disproportionately apply to lower ranking programs when compared to male applicants.Methods: For each institution, we identified their 2016 U.S. News and World Report ""Best Medical Schools: Research"" ranking and examined trends across rankings using linear regression models, such as relationships between the percentage of female applicants and other factors that may influence where applicants apply.Results: The female applicants who do apply to MSTP programs apply disproportionately to lower ranking programs. Despite this, women seem to have the same success rate for gaining admission to MSTPs, as indicated by matriculation rates across programs, regardless of program rank.Conclusions: Our findings of gender disparity in applications to high-ranking but not low-ranking programs support prior hypotheses that under-confidence or lack of encouragement may drive this inequality.

Gender Gap in Academic Surgery: Disparities in Early-Career Scholarly Productivity Sets the Stage for Unequal Academic Advancement,"Kim, G; Goodman, E; Adams, A; Skendelas, J; Ward, J; Wang, F; Lu, SE; In, H","Introduction: Gender disparities exist in academic surgery despite advances in the field. This study aimed to examine the extent of gender disparities in career advancement and promotion among academic faculty in surgery and understand the influence of academic productivity. Methods: Cross-sectional study using publicly available information from online faculty profiles of 18 large academic US general surgery residency programs. Gender equality was examined overall and as subgroups by career stage (late-, mid-, and early-career) to account for differences over time. Logistic regression identified factors associated with gender disparities. Mediation analysis examined if the gender difference in academic advancement was mediated by academic productivity. Results: Of the 1467 faculty members, 388 (26.4%) were women. Gender disparity in academic advancement was observed in the early-career cohort (33.4% versus 23.8%, P = 0.006). Women in the early-career cohort were nearly 40% less likely to achieve academic advancement (odds ratio 0.62 [95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88]) and more than 50% less likely to have >30 publications (odds ratio 0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.32-0.63]) than men. The effect of gender was no longer significant once publication volume and fellowship training was incorporated into the model on multivariable regression. Mediation analysis showed that >30 publications mediated nearly 67% of the effect of gender on academic advancement in the early-career cohort. Conclusions: The gender gap in academic advancement for early-career faculty can partially be explained by the lower number of publications produced by women faculty.

Bias Perpetuates Bias: ChatGPT Learns Gender Inequities in Academic Surgery Promotions,"Desai, P; Wang, H; Davis, L; Ullmann, TM; Dibrito, SR","OBJECTIVE: Gender inequities persist in academic surgery with implicit bias impacting hiring and promotion at all levels. We hypothesized that creating letters of recommendation for both female and male candidates for academic promotion in surgery using an AI platform, ChatGPT, would elucidate the entrained gender biases already present in the promotion process. DESIGN: Using ChatGPT, we generated 6 letters of recommendation for ""a phenomenal surgeon applying for job promotion to associate professor position"", specifying ""female"" or ""male"" before surgeon in the prompt. We compared 3 ""female"" letters to 3 ""male"" letters for differences in length, language, and tone. RESULTS: The letters written for females averaged 298 words compared to 314 for males. Female letters more frequently referred to ""compassion"", ""empathy"", and ""inclusivity""; whereas male letters referred to ""respect"", ""reputation"", and ""skill"". CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the gender bias present in promotion letters generated by ChatGPT, reiterating existing literature regarding real letters of recommendation in academic surgery.

Whether sex differences in academic rank exist across all surgical fields, and after adjustment for confounders, is not known.Methods: A comprehensive list of surgeons with faculty appointments at US medical schools in 2014 was obtained from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) faculty roster and linked to a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, an online physician networking website, which contained the following data for all physicians: sex, age, years since residency, publication number (total and first/last author), clinical trials participation, National Institutes of Health grants, and surgical subspecialty. A 20% sample of 2013 Medicare payments for care was added to this dataset. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate sex differences in full professorship, adjusting for these variables and medical school-specific fixed effects.Results: Among 11,549 surgeon faculty at US medical schools in 2014, 1692 (14.7%) were women. Women comprised 19.4% of assistant professors (1072/ 5538), 13.8% of associate professors (404/2931), and 7.0% of full professors (216/3080).

In this commentary, the authors cite research related to the effects of institutional gender bias in academic medicine, including research on bias against women of color. As academic leaders who come from underrepresented groups, the authors are aware that traditional approaches to reducing this bias have not worked well, and they instead highlight promising strategies aimed at filling the pathway to leadership with women of color who are qualified and ready to take the helm. They address solutions to ensure the academic pathway is supportive. They also provide several recommendations, including: offering more opportunities for mentorship and sponsorship, improving access to formal leadership programming, modeling successful upstander initiatives, recognizing the growing role of minority-based medical societies, implementing early-career education, increasing journal editorial board representation, and expanding promotion criteria.

The significance of pay difference may be underestimated, with little data evaluating its effect on lifetime wealth after accounting for factors like time to promotion and savings.OBJECTIVES To characterize gender disparities in salary and assess the outcomes associated with a gender equity initiative (GEI).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Quality improvement study with simulations of salary and additional accumulated wealth (AAW) using retrospectively reviewed Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine annual salary and promotion data. All academic faculty were included in the faculty salary analysis from 2005 (n = 1481) and 2016 (n = 1885).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Salary and longitudinal promotion data from 2005 to 2016 were used to estimate gender-based differences in salary and time to promotion. The effect of these differences on total salary and AAW, including retirement and salary-based investments, was simulated for a representative male and female faculty member over a 30-year career in 3 scenarios: (1) pre-GEI, (2) post-GEI, and (3) in real time for GEI, beginning with and progressing through these initiatives.RESULTS Analyses of salaries of 1481 faculty (432 women) in 2005 and 1885 faculty (742 women) in 2016 revealed that a decade after GEI implementation, the overall mean (SE) salary gap by gender decreased from -2.6%(1.2%) (95% CI, -5.6% to -0.3%) to -1.9% (1.1%) (95% CI, -4.1% to 0.3%). Simulation of pre-GEI disparities correlated with male faculty collecting an average lifetime AAW of $501 416 more than the equivalent woman, with disparities persisting past retirement. The AAW gap decreased to $ 210 829 in the real-time GEI simulation and to $ 66 104 using post-GEI conditions, reflecting success of GEI efforts.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Even small gender-based salary gaps are associated with substantial differences in lifetime wealth, but an institutional commitment to achieving equitable promotion and compensation for women can appreciably reduce these disparities. The findings of this study support broad implementation of similar initiatives without delay, as results may take more than a decade to emerge.

However, few studies have reported gender differences in promotion adjusted for scholarly production and national or international reputation, namely, career duration, publications, grant funding, and leadership positions. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the differences between men and women in achieving benchmarks for promotion and analyze where such differences lie geographically and within specialties. Method A systematic search of Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, Cochrane Library, ERIC, GenderWatch, Google Scholar, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from inception to August 17, 2022. All studies that reported the number of male and female full professors on medical school faculty were included. The primary outcome was the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for promotion to full professor for women compared with men. Results Two hundred forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The unadjusted OR for promotion to full professor for women was 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.41). Sixteen studies reported an AOR. The pooled AOR of promotion for women to full professor was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46-0.77). The AOR for promotion to full professor was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.88) in surgery and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.57-1.11) in internal medicine. Statistical heterogeneity was high (Q = 66.6, I-2 = 79.4%, P < .001). On meta-regression, 77% of the heterogeneity was from studies outside the United States, where more disparity was reported (AOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.22-0.38).

It is unclear whether these differences persist.MethodsWe merged data from the Association of American Medical Colleges on all medical school graduates from 1979 through 2013 with faculty data through 2018, and we compared the percentages of women who would be expected to be promoted on the basis of the proportion of women in the graduating class with the actual percentages of women who were promoted. We calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and used adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models to examine the differences between the early cohorts (1979-1997) and the late cohorts (1998-2013).ResultsThe sample included 559,098 graduates from 134 U.S. medical schools. In most of the cohorts, fewer women than expected were promoted to the rank of associate or full professor or appointed to the post of department chair. Findings were similar across basic science and clinical departments. In analyses that included all the cohorts, after adjustment for graduation year, race or ethnic group, and department type, women assistant professors were less likely than their male counterparts to be promoted to associate professor (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.78). Similar sex disparities existed in promotions to full professor (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81) and appointments to department chair (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.54). These sex differences in promotions and appointments did not diminish over time and were not smaller in the later cohorts than in the earlier cohorts.

"Promoting Girls' Participation in K-12 STEM Education: Current Landscape, Hindering Factors, and Recommendations for Actions","IEEE; Wang, TC; Zhang, MM; Gao, Y","This paper examines the current landscape and factors contributing to the under-participation of girls in STEM education within Australian K-12 education contexts. By utilising a desk research approach that reviews a wide scope of literature sources, it explores diverse perspectives on the issue of gender disparity in K-12 STEM education participation. Our review confirmed the ""The Leaky Pipeline"" reality as described by many scholars. The investigation further uncovers a complex interplay of environmental and personal factors that act as barriers to girls' engagement in STEM. Environmental factors include insufficient teacher capacity for gender-responsive STEM education; unconscious teacher bias; a lack of female role models in STEM; underdeveloped school culture; peer influence; and family influences. Personal factors include a perceived lack of social belonging and wavering self-efficacy beliefs. Collectively, these form a substantial obstacle influencing girls' decisions and experiences with STEM.In light of these findings, this paper proposes a holistic approach that necessitates strategic interventions across ten key areas: shaping a compelling and inclusive school vision; enhancing gender inclusivity in the curriculum; strengthening teacher capacity for gender-responsive STEM education; advocating for supportive school policies and funding incentives; increasing access to female role models in STEM; involving parents; establishing dedicated career pathway advisors; forging partnerships with universities and industry; conducting periodic school self-evaluations; and promoting teacher action research.By providing such a comprehensive and actionable blueprint for key K-12 education stakeholders-particularly policymakers, school leaders, and teachers-this research advocates for creating an environment conducive to girls' success in STEM, ultimately contributing to the elimination of the persistent gender disparity in this field.",2023,,"2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TEACHING, ASSESSMENT AND LEARNING FOR ENGINEERING, TALE",,,708-714,WOS:001191023500111,10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398365,,#522,IEEE 2023,"",""

High School Rank in Math and English and the Gender Gap in STEM,"Delaney, JM; Devereux, PJ","Using unique data on preference rankings for all high school students who apply for college in Ireland, we investigate whether, conditional on absolute achievement at the end of high school, within school-cohort rank in English and math affects choice of college major. We find that higher rank in math increases the likelihood of choosing STEM and decreases the likelihood of choosing Arts and Social Sciences. Similarly, a higher rank in English leads to an increase in the probability of choosing Arts and Social Sciences and decreases the probability of choosing STEM. The effects of subject ranks on STEM are larger for boys than girls while there is no evidence of a gender difference in the effect of subject ranks on Arts and Social Sciences. We also find that English and math rank can explain about 4% of the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major and 9% of the gender gap that is not explained by absolute achievement. Overall, the tendency for girls to be higher ranked in English and lower ranked in math within school-cohorts can explain about 10% of the difference in the STEM gender gap between mixed-sex schools and same-sex schools and about 25% of the difference that is unexplained by absolute achievement.

REFLECT - A Teacher Training Program to Promote Gender Equality in Schools,"Kollmayer, M; Schultes, MT; Lüftenegger, M; Finsterwald, M; Spiel, C; Schober, B","Despite formally equal educational opportunities for women and men, educational and occupational careers are still characterized by gender disparities rather than gender equality. Men are overrepresented in STEM fields and higher positions, while women are frequently working in low-status jobs in the health and social sector. These differences already emerge during school time, when girls report lower academic self-concepts in STEM subjects than boys even after achievement is controlled for while the same is true for boys' self-concepts in reading and languages. Gender stereotypes that are conveyed by socializing agents are assumed to play an important role in maintaining gender differences in education. Teachers are important starting points for promoting gender equality in education as their attitudes and instructional practices are known to influence students' motivation and performance substantially. To promote girls and boys equally in coeducational settings, teachers have to reflect on their own gender stereotypes. Moreover, they require knowledge about gender differences in education and about teaching methods to foster the motivation of all students regardless of their gender. However, gender stereotypes are rarely dealt with in general teacher education and training programs that build teachers' competences for reflective coeducation are sparse. Against this backdrop, we present the teacher training program REFLECT that was developed to foster secondary school teachers' competences for supporting students in developing their individual potentials without being restricted by gender stereotypes. REFLECT is theoretically based on the systemic actiotope model and aims to expand teachers' objective action repertoire (knowledge, teaching methods) as well as their subjective action space (self-efficacy beliefs, implicit theories). The results of a pilot study show the effectiveness of REFLECT. Teachers' objective action repertoire and subjective action space for promoting boys and girls equally increased, as did students' knowledge of gender differences and perception of diversity fairness in the classroom.

Fixing the leaky pipeline: Tips to promote gender equity in Academic Medicine,"Stadler, DJ; Ibrahim, H; Cofrancesco, JC; Archuleta, S","Introduction: Gender equity in academic medicine is a global concern. Women physicians lag behind men in salary, research productivity, and reaching top academic rank and leadership positions.Methods: In this Global Perspective, we provide suggestions for overcoming gender bias, drawn from a multidisciplinary literature and personal experiences working as clinician educators in the international academic arena. These suggestions are not exhaustive but inform a tool kit for institutions and individuals to support the advancement of women in academic medicine.Results: Barriers include limited access to same gender role models and mentors, fewer networking opportunities, fewer nominations for awards and speakership opportunities, as well as implicit gender bias. Institutional interventions can address disparities along the career continuum focusing on scholarship, promotion and leadership opportunities. Women faculty can also seek out professional development programmes and mentorship to support their own advancement. Informal and formal networking opportunities, using a variety of platforms, including social media, can help build relationships to enhance career development and success, and provide social, emotional and professional support to women at all stages of their career. The National University Health System's Women in Science and Healthcare project is an example of a successful group formed to empower women and foster personal and professional development.Conclusion: Successful incentives and policies need to consider local institutional and cultural contexts, as well as approaches to mitigate implicit bias.

The authors collected data from online public records and augmented their findings via direct outreach to medical schools. They used time-to-event analyses before and after adjustment for interim vs permanent status of the initial appointment, school ownership (public/private), and school size to assess for gender differences in length of deanship tenure during the study period. The unit of analysis was deanships, and the primary outcome was length of deanships measured in years.ResultsAuthors included data on 528 deanships. Women held 91 (17%) of these terms. Men held the majority of permanent deanships (n = 352 [85%]). A greater percentage of the deanships held by women were interim only (n = 27 [30%]) compared with men (n = 85 [20%]). In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no significant gender differences in length of deanship tenures.ConclusionsAnalysis of appointments of AAMC-member medical school deans from 2006 to 2020 revealed that women have remained in their deanships as long as their male counterparts. The myth about women deans' shorter longevity should no longer be promulgated. Academic medicine should consider novel solutions to addressing women's persistent underrepresentation in the dean role, including employing the gender proportionality principle used in the business and legal communities.",2024,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,99,1,63-69,WOS:001134819400005,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005315,,#535,Gottlieb 2024,"",""
CAREERS WITHOUT GENDER: STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY IN ENGINEERING,"Santos, B; Calado, R; Oliveira, CS","In the last years, European Union has strongly promoted to increase the number of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) courses at universities, and consequently women presence in these labour markets.

Academics as Agentic Superheroes: Female academics' lack of fit with the agentic stereotype of success limits their career advancement,"Van Veelen, R; Derks, B","Gender gaps in academia persist with women being less likely to attain leadership, earning lower salaries, and receiving less research funding and resources compared to their male peers. The current research demonstrates yet another, more intangible gender gap in academia called lack of fit, whereby compared to male academics, female academics perceive higher misfit between their professional self-concept and the agentic 'superhero' stereotype of the successful academic. The entire population of Dutch academics (i.e., assistant, associate, and full professors from 14 universities) was approached to participate in a nationwide survey. Results from this unique dataset (N = 3978) demonstrate that academics perceive agency (e.g., self-confident, self-focused, competitive) as more descriptive of the stereotypical successful academic than communality (e.g., team-oriented, good teacher, collegial). Importantly, early career female academics perceived highest lack of fit with this narrowly-defined agentic occupational stereotype, which was correlated with lower work engagement, professional identification and career efficacy, and higher work exhaustion and exit intentions. Thus, lack of fit seems yet another barrier contributing to pervasive gender gaps in academia.

We conducted a pooled analysis of the difference in the proportion of men versus women with full professorship among academic physicians. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Education Resources Information Center and PsycINFO were searched from inception to 3 July 2020. Study selection All original studies reporting faculty rank stratified by gender worldwide were included. Data extraction and synthesis Study screening, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers, with a third author resolving discrepancies. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. Results Our search yielded 5897 articles. 218 studies were included with 991 207 academic physician data points. Men were 2.77 times more likely to be full professors (182 271/643 790 men vs 30 349/251 501 women, OR 2.77, 95% CI 2.57 to 2.98).

Does Sponsorship Promote Equity in Career Advancement in Academic Medicine? A Scoping Review,"Schwartz, R; Williams, MF; Feldman, MD","Sponsorship describes a set of actions wherein an influential champion (sponsor) uses their position to actively support a colleague's career by helping them gain visibility, recognition, and/or positions. There is growing awareness of the importance of sponsorship for career advancement in academic medicine, particularly for women and those who are historically underrepresented and excluded in medicine (UIM). This scoping review examines the current landscape of evidence, and knowledge gaps, on sponsorship as it relates to career advancement in academic medicine for women and UIM faculty. We searched peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS) over the past 50 years (from 1973 through July 2023). Sixteen studies were included in the final review. We found relative consensus on sponsorship definition and value to career advancement. Heterogeneity in study design limited our ability to directly compare study outcomes. All included studies focused on gender differences in sponsorship: two of four quantitative studies found men were more likely to receive sponsorship, one reported no gender differences, and one was insufficiently powered. All but one of the qualitative studies reported gender differences, with women less likely to access or be identified for sponsorship. The mixed-methods studies suggested sponsorship may vary by career stage. Only two studies analyzed sponsorship for UIM populations. The existing data are inconclusive regarding best ways to measure and assess sponsorship, what institutional support (e.g., structured programs, formal recognition, or incentives for sponsorship) should look like, and at what career stage sponsorship is most important. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critically important for understanding what sponsorship best practices, if any, should be used to promote equity in career advancement in academic medicine.

Gender Differences in Promotion and Scholarly Impact: An Analysis of 1460 Academic Ophthalmologists,"Lopez, SA; Svider, PF; Misra, P; Bhagat, N; Langer, PD; Eloy, JA","OBJECTIVES: In recent years, gender differences in academic promotion have been documented within surgical fields. To the best of our knowledge, gender discrepancies in association with scholarly productivity have not been well assessed among academic ophthalmologists. Because research productivity is strongly associated with academic career advancement, we sought to determine whether gender differences in scholarly impact, measured by the h-index, exist among academic ophthalmologists.DESIGN: Academic rank and gender were determined using faculty listings from academic ophthalmology departments. h-index and publication experience (in years) of faculty members were determined using the Scopus database.SETTING: Academic medical center.RESULTS: From assistant professor through professor, the h-index increased with subsequent academic rank (p < 0.001), although between chairpersons and professors no statistical difference was found (p > 0.05). Overall, men had higher h-indices (h = 10.4 LI.- 0.34 standard error of mean) than women (h = 6.0 0.38 standard error of mean), a finding that was only statistically significant among assistant professors in a subgroup analysis. Women were generally underrepresented among senior positions. When controlling for publication range (i.e., length of time publishing), men had higher h-indices among those with 1 to 10 years of publication experience (p < 0.0001), whereas women had scholarly impact equivalent to and even exceeding that of men later in their careers.CONCLUSION: Women in academic ophthalmology continue to be underrepresented among senior faculty. Although women surpass men in scholarly productivity during the later stages of their careers, low scholarly impact during the earlier stages may impede academic advancement and partly explain the gender disparity in senior academic positions.

Whereas mentorship often centers on personal and professional development (e.g., skill building and goal setting), sponsorship focuses on enhancing the visibility, credibility, and professional networks of talented individuals. For upward career mobility, mentorship is limited in scope. Sponsorship, on the other hand, directly targets career advancement and is anchored in the sponsor's awareness of organizational structures and critical professional opportunities for junior faculty. Men are more likely to garner sponsors informally, and these sponsors tend to be male. Existing disparities between male and female medical faculty in achievement of academic rank and leadership roles, compensation, and research support suggest that high-performing women have a visibility gap. Such systemic inequity reflects a suboptimal business model that limits organizational potential. Formal sponsorship programs that match women with senior leaders facilitate access to beneficial relationships and institutionalize the value of equal opportunity. In this Perspective, the authors describe two successful sponsorship models that exist within academic medicine, the Society of General Internal Medicine's Career Advising Program and MD Anderson Cancer Center's Leaders' Sponsorship Program. They issue a call to action for much broader implementation of sponsorship programming to cultivate the advancement of all talented medical faculty and provide recommendations for such endeavors.",2018,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,93,11,1620-1623,WOS:000448728000014,10.1097/ACM.0000000000002342,,#561,Gottlieb 2018,"",""

Previous research documents a gender bias in participation, with women participating less than would be expected on the basis of their numeric proportions. In the present study, we asked which attributes of the learning environment contribute to decreased female participation: the abundance of in-class interactions, the diversity of interactions, the proportion of women in class, the instructor's gender, the class size, and whether the course targeted lower division (first and second year) or upper division (third or fourth year) students. We calculated likelihood ratios of female participation from over 5300 student-instructor interactions observed across multiple institutions.

The Glass Ceiling in Plastic Surgery: A Propensity-Matched Analysis of the Gender Gap in Career Advancement,"Ngaage, LM; Ngadimin, C; Harris, C; Rawes, C; Wu, YL; Landford, W; Slezak, S; Rasko, YM","Background: Gender parity remains elusive in academic plastic surgery. It is unknown whether this disparity is attributable to differences in qualifications or to the glass ceiling of gender bias. To parse this, the authors compared academic titles and departmental leadership of female academic plastic surgeons to a matched group of their male counterparts. Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of academic plastic surgeons. The authors identified faculty, sex, academic rank, and leadership positions from plastic surgery residency program websites. The authors then collected details on training institution, advanced degrees, years in practice, andh-index for use as independent variables. The authors performed a propensity score analysis to 1:1 match male and female academic plastic surgeons. Results: A total of 818 academic plastic surgeons were included. The cohort was predominately male [n= 658 (81 percent)], with a median 12 years in practice and a medianh-index of 9. Before matching, men had more years in practice (13 years versus 9 years;p< 0.0001), a greaterh-index (11 versus 5;p< 0.0001), were more likely to be professors (34 percent versus 13 percent;p< 0.0001), and held more leadership positions than women (41 percent versus 30 percent;p= 0.0221). Following matching, gender parity was demonstrated in academic rank and departmental leadership. Conclusions: Differences in training, qualifications, career length, and academic productivity may account for the leadership gap in academic plastic surgery.

"Analysis of Gender-based Differences in Surgery Faculty Compensation, Promotion, and Retention <i>Establishing Equity</i>","Hoops, HE; Brasel, KJ; Dewey, E; Rodgers, S; Merrill, J; Hunter, JG; Azarow, KS","Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate gender-based differences in faculty salaries before and after implementation of a university-wide objective compensation plan, Faculty First (FF), in alignment with Association of American Medical Colleges regional median salary (AAMC-WRMS). Gender-based differences in promotion and retention were also assessed.Summary Background Data: Previous studies demonstrate that female faculty within surgery are compensated less than male counterparts are and have decreased representation in higher academic ranks and leadership positions.Methods: At a single institution, surgery faculty salaries and work relative value units (wRVUs) were reviewed from 2009 to 2017, and time to promotion and retention were reviewed from 1998 to 2007. In 2015, FF supplanted specialty-specific compensation plans. Salaries and wRVUs relative to AAMC-WRMS, time to promotion, and retention were compared between genders.Results: Female faculty (N = 24) were compensated significantly less than males were (N = 62) before FF (P = 0.004). Female faculty compensation significantly increased after FF (P < 0.001). After FF, female and male faculty compensation was similar (P = 0.32). Average time to promotion for female (N = 29) and male faculty (N = 82) was similar for promotion to associate professor (P = 0.49) and to full professor (P = 0.37). Promotion was associated with significantly higher retention for both genders (P < 0.001). The median time of departure was similar between female and male faculty (P = 0.73).Conclusions: A university-wide objective compensation plan increased faculty salaries to the AAMC western region median, allowing correction of gender-based salary inequity.

Sex Differences in Academic Productivity Across Academic Ranks and Specialties in Academic Medicine A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Ha, GL; Lehrer, EJ; Wang, M; Holliday, E; Jagsi, R; Zaorsky, NG","IMPORTANCE Despite equal numbers of men and women entering medical school, women are underrepresented in the upper echelons of academic medicine and receive less compensation and research funding. Citation-related publication productivity metrics, such as the h-index, are increasingly used for hiring, salary, grants, retention, promotion, and tenure decisions. Exploring sex differences in these metrics across academic medicine provides deeper insight into why differences are observed in career outcomes.OBJECTIVE To systematically examine the available literature on sex differences in h-index of academic faculty physicians across all medical specialties and all levels of academic rank.DATA SOURCES Medical literature with the term h-index found in PubMed and published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, was used.STUDY SELECTION A PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses), and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) selection protocol was used to find observational studies that published h-indexes for faculty physicians that were stratified by sex. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, retracted, or unavailable online. Ultimately, 14 of 786 studies (1.78%) met the inclusion criteria.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data from 9 studies across 16 specialties were examined using weighted random-effects meta-analyses. Five studies were excluded because of overlapping specialties with another study or because they were missing appropriate statistics for the meta-analysis. Four of these studies were included in qualitative synthesis to bring the total to 13 studies.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was the h-index.RESULTS The meta-analysis included 10 665 North American unique academic physicians across 9 different studies from the years 2009 to 2018. Of the 10 665 physicians, 2655 (24.89%) were women. Summary effect sizes for mean h-indexes of men and women and mean h-index difference between men and women were determined for all faculty physicians and at each academic rank. Overall, female faculty had lower h-indexes than male faculty (mean difference, -4.09; 95% CI, -5.44 to -2.73; P < .001). When adjusting for academic rank, female faculty still had lower h-indexes than male faculty at the ranks of assistant professor (mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -1.90 to -0.72; P < .001), associate professor (mean difference, -2.09; 95% CI, -3.40 to -0.78; P = .002), and professor (mean difference, -3.41; 95% CI, -6.24 to -0.58; P = .02).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, women had lower h-indexes than men across most specialties and at all academic ranks, but it is unclear why these differences exist. These findings suggest that future investigation should be conducted regarding the causes of lower h-indexes in women and that interventions should be developed to provide a more equitable environment for all physicians regardless of sex.",2021,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,4,6,,WOS:000669052200001,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.12404,,#566,Ha 2021,"",""
"Advanced degrees, gender, and professional rank in surgery, disparities in academic medicine","Carman, M; Zink, H; Larson, K; Balanoff, C; Wagner, J; Chollet-Hinton, L; Kilgore, L","Introduction: Women comprise nearly half of all residents in training, yet there is a significant disparity of women in academic leadership. Surgical subspecialties are dominated by men in both percentages of physicians and leadership positions. We sought to examine the association of advanced non-medical degrees with academic rank and gender in academic surgery departments. Methods: Faculty from 126 ACGME-accredited academic medical centers were analyzed to identify faculty gender as described in online biographical information, advanced non-medical degrees, academic rank, and additional leadership positions held. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. Results: 4536 surgeons were identified, 69.3% men, 27.3% female, and 3.3% unlisted. Female surgeons were more likely to hold advanced non-doctoral degrees than men (18.2% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.002). Among those with advanced degrees, PhDs were held by 3.3% of women and 5.7% of men (p < 0.001). Female surgeons were less likely to hold the rank of Professor than male surgeons (15.8% vs 30.3%, p < 0.001), and more likely to hold the rank of Assistant Professor than male surgeons (51.9% vs 36.1%, p < 0.001). This likelihood remained true when analyzing only surgeons with one or more advanced non-medical degrees. Men were more likely to be Chair of Surgery (3.0%), Division Chief (9.6%), and Research Chair (0.5%); compared to women (1.3%; 4.8%; 0.2%; p 1/4 0.001, <0.001, 0.21 respectively).

Women's Experiences of Promotion and Tenure in Academic Medicine and Potential Implications for Gender Disparities in Career Advancement A Qualitative Analysis,"Murphy, M; Callander, JK; Dohan, D; Grandis, JR","IMPORTANCE Gender disparities in career advancement in academic medicine have persisted despite gender parity in medical school matriculation. Although numerous explanations for this gap exist, little is known about women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine.OBJECTIVE To examine women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine to uncover mechanisms associated with the gender disparity in career advancement.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this qualitative study, 52 in-depth, semistructured interviews with women academic medicine faculty members were conducted in 2019. The 52 participants were drawn from 16 medical schools across the US. Institutions were selected using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity of geography and ownership (private or public). Within institutions, purposive and snowball sampling were used to seek diversity with respect to respondents' degree type (MD, PhD, and MD and PhD), age, and career stage. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Data analysis was performed from March to December 2020.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Themes and subthemes in participants' experiences of promotion and tenure.RESULTS The 52 women in this study ranged in age from 34 to 82 years (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [10.7] years). Eighteen respondents (34.6%) held an MD, 4 (7.7%) held both an MD and PhD, and 30 (57.7%) held a PhD. Fourteen respondents (26.9%) were assistant professors at the time of the study, 8 (15.4%) were associate professors, and 30 (57.7%) were full professors. Four main themes within participants' experiences of promotion and tenure that pertain to gender inequities were identified: ambiguous or inconsistent criteria for promotion or tenure; lack of standard processes for reviewing applications and making decisions; vulnerability to malicious behavior of senior faculty, department chairs, and division chiefs; and women seeing men have different experiences of advancement.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The respondents' experiences of promotion and tenure suggest that promotion and tenure processes may be characterized by inconsistency and a lack of oversight, which have the potential to contribute to well-documented patterns of gender disparities in career advancement in academic medicine.",2021,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,4,9,,WOS:000698769200006,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25843,,#568,Murphy 2021,"",""
Sex Differences in Academic Rank in US Medical Schools in 2014,"Jena, AB; Khullar, D; Ho, O; Olenski, AR; Blumenthal, DM","The number of women entering medical schools in the United States has increased to the point where women make up half of all US graduates. However, sex disparities exist in senior faculty rank. Female physician researchers also earn less than do their male counterparts, even when adjusted for differences in academic productivity. Previous studies on this topic have several limitations, and none have considered these data along with factors such as experience, research funding, scientific authorship, and physician training. This study hypothesized that after adjustment for several factors-sex, age, years since residency completion, specialty, National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding, scientific authorship, and clinical trial participation-sex differences in faculty rank would still exist.A cross-sectional database of 1,005,419 physicians in the United States in 2014 was used to collect information. For each physician, data were assembled using NIH RePORT, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Some of this information was self-verified by registered members, whereas some was supplied by institutions. The subgroup of registered members was analyzed first as those data were likely more accurate. Then, data on faculty rank, PubMed publications, clinical trial participation, and NIH funding weremanually confirmed for a random sample of 200. The data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic model to estimate the probability of full professorship as a function of the factors listed in the hypothesis. A subgroup was analyzed to compare differences in full professorship according to specialty and medical school research ranking (schools listed as top 20 in the United States according to US News & World Report in 2013 vs those not listed as top 20).A total of 91,073 faculty members were included in the study. Of those, 66.5% were men. Compared with men, women were less likely to be full professors (11.9% [3623 of 30,464] vs 28.6% [17354 of 60,609]; absolute difference, -16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.3% to -16.2%). Women tended to be specialized in internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, on average, and were also younger and more recently completed residency. Representation of women at top 20 versus not top-ranked schools was similar (29.2% [8893 of 30,464] vs 28.3% [17,173 of 60,609]; difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.1%). Women were less likely than men to have conducted clinical trials (6.4% vs 8.8%; difference, -2.4% CI, -2.8% to 2.0%) and were also less likely to have NIH funding (6.8% vs 10.3%, difference, -3.5%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 2.0%). Women also had fewer first-or last-author publications than did their male peers (mean total, 11.6 vs 24.8, difference, -13.2; 95% CI, -13.6 to -12.7; mean first-or last-author publication; 5.9 vs 13.7; difference, -7.8; 95% CI, -8.1 to -7.5). Women were less likely to be full professor or associate or full professor by 2014 in 3 residency cohorts (1980, 1990, and 2000), and among faculty who were associate or full professor in 2014, fewer women than men were full professor across all cohorts.After accounting for age, experience, specialty, and measures of research productivity, women were substantially less likely to be full professors in US medical schools.

In the light of numerous empirical studies which locate the main reasons for career disadvantages of women within the sphere of private life, the focus of gender equality policies on discrimination at an organisational level seems misplaced. This does not only explain the policies' lack of efficacy, it also increases the damage. The gallantry model of female promotion victimises and stigmatises women, puts men at a disadvantage and places appointment procedures under suspicion, questioning the professional neutrality and endangering the social acceptance of such procedures.

Highly Skilled Women Reaching the Top: A Cost-free Achievement? Analyzing the Gender Promotion Gap in the Medical Profession,"Gaiaschi, C","This paper investigates the gender promotion gap in a particular highly skilled profession, that of physicians. The following analyses are based on a dataset of more than a thousand doctorsworking in Italy, a country in which hospitals play a central role in the national health care system. Given a three-step career ladder-first level, vice, and head-this research finds that women are 8% less likely than men to be promoted from the first level to vice, whereas no significant disadvantage is found in the promotion from vice to head. This suggests that the vertical segregation is due more to a sticky floors mechanism than to a glass ceiling effect. Moreover, no motherhood penalty occurs. Private organizations appear to be more gender equal than public ones and similar, albeitweaker, findings come from the analysis of the specialties, cautiously suggesting that the male-dominated area of surgery is more gender equal than the female-dominated area of medicine. These findings point out that women in highly skilled professions may encounter fewer obstacles to promotion than in the general labor market. Furthermore, they may encounter fewer obstacles within the most competitive organizations and specialty areas than across the profession in general. This is not, however, because of a greater number of opportunities, but because they represent a highly selected and career-oriented population. These results shed light on the costs of such achievement for women, both in terms of effort and in terms of equality among women themselves.",2021,,SOCIAL FORCES,100,2,622-648,WOS:000747932200033,10.1093/sf/soab026,,#575,Gaiaschi 2021,"",""

To achieve this, we conducted a scoping review of three databases-PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo-to assess the extent that PCC, PeCC, FCC, and RCC were referenced by different specialties in the medical literature. Reference to PCC and PeCC in the literature correlates significantly with the number of female physicians in each field (all p < 0.00001) except for neurosurgery (p > 0.5). Pediatrics shows the most extensive reference to PCC, followed by OBGYN, with a significant difference between all disciplines (p < 0.001). FCC remains exclusively embraced by pediatrics.

"Evaluating a Medical School's Climate for Women's Success: Outcomes for Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion","Villablanca, AC; Li, YJ; Beckett, LA; Howell, LP","Objective: Women are under-represented in academia. Causative factors include challenges of career-family integration. We evaluated factors reflecting institutional culture (promotion, retention, hiring, and biasing language in promotion letters) as part of an intervention to help shift culture and raise awareness of flexibility policies at the University of California, Davis (UCD). Materials and Methods: Data on faculty use of family-friendly policies were obtained at baseline, and surveys for policy awareness were conducted pre(2010)/post(2013) an NIH-funded study educational intervention. Data on hires, separations, and promotions were obtained pre(2007-2009, 2234 person-year data points)/post(2010-2012, 2384 person-year data points) intervention and compared by logistic regression and for gender differences. Department promotion letters (53) were also analyzed for biasing language. Results: Policy use was overall low, highest for female assistant professors, and for maternity leave. Awareness significantly increased for all policies postintervention. Promotions decreased, likely because of increases in advancement deferrals or tenure clock extensions. Pre/postintervention, female and male hires were near parity for assistant professors, but female hires were substantially lower than males for associate (54% less likely, p=0.03) and full professors (70% less likely, p=0.002). Once hired, women were no more likely to separate than men. Fewer associate/full professors separated than assistant professors (p=0.002, p<0.001, respectively), regardless of gender.

Conclusions: We demonstrate a shift at UCD toward a culture of work-life flexibility, an environment in which letters of recommendation show very few biased descriptions, and in which assistant professor hiring is gender equitable.

Gender Disparities Among Academic Vitreoretinal Specialists in the United States With Regard to Scholarly Impact and Academic Rank,"Oncel, D; Syal, S; Reyes, NA; Acikalin, B","Background and objective While men outnumber women in the specialty of ophthalmology in general, the subspecialty of vitreoretinal surgery in particular has the highest percentage of men across all ophthalmic subspecialties. This study aimed to analyze the gender disparities regarding the publication productivity and academic rank of academic vitreoretinal specialists in the United States (US). Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated 116 ophthalmology residency programs in the US participating in the 2022 San Francisco Match. The academic vitreoretinal faculty from each ophthalmology residency program was included. The information on gender, academic rank, and publication activity in terms of the h-index were collected from institutional websites, the Scopus database, and the National Library of Medicine PubMed website. Results A total of 467 academic vitreoretinal specialists were identified. Among them, 345 (73.9%) were men, and 122 (26.1%) were women (p<0.001). When the academic ranks were analyzed, a higher number of men (43.8%) were found to hold the rank of full professor as compared to women. Furthermore, a higher number of women (47.5%) were found to hold the rank of assistant professor as compared to their male colleagues. Regarding the number of publications, in all academic rank categories, women had a significantly lower number of publications compared to men (p<0.001). Men also had a higher publication productivity or scholarly impact [h-index=15.2 & PLUSMN; 0.82 standard error of the mean (SEM)] compared to women (h-index=12.8 & PLUSMN; 0.99 SEM) (p=0.0004). Higher h-index correlated with higher academic rank, from assistant professor through full professor (p<0.001). Conclusion The field of vitreoretinal surgery has significantly fewer women compared to men, with women producing fewer publications and having less scholarly impact. H-index and total number of publications are also associated with a higher academic rank. Furthermore, full professors are more likely to be men, while assistant professors are more likely to be women.

Analysis of H-index in Assessing Gender Differences in Academic Rank and Leadership in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the United States and Canada,"Yang, HY; Rhee, G; Xuan, LS; Silver, JK; Jalal, S; Khosa, F","Objectives: The aims of the study were ( 1) to establish potential gender differences in academic physical medicine and rehabilitation faculty across the United States and Canada and ( 2) to evaluate associations between physician gender, leadership position, and research productivity. Design: Physical medicine and rehabilitation programs enlisted in Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database ( n = 72) and Canadian ResidentMatching Service ( n = 9) were searched for academic faculty with Doctor ofMedicine degrees to generate a database of gender and academic profiles. Bibliometric data were collected using Elsevier's Scopus and analyzed by Strata v14.2. Results: Of 1045 faculty meeting the inclusion criteria, 653 were men and 392 were women. Men were found in greater numbers across all academic ranks, with professors as most conspicuous ( 79.14%), and held most ( 85.54%) leadership positions. The study's prediction model assessed for gender differences in academic rank and leadership roles and found that odds of men having higher h- index as 0.78 ( 95% confidence interval = 0.24- 0.87), indicating that women were not significantly inferior in academic performance.

Using the prisms of gender and rank to interpret research collaboration power dynamics,"Gaughan, M; Bozeman, B","Collaboration is central to modern scientific inquiry, and increasingly important to the professional experiences of academic scientists. While the effects of collaboration have been widely studied, much less is understood about the motivations to collaborate and collaboration dynamics that generate scientific outcomes. A particular interest of this study is to understand how collaboration experiences differ between women and men, and the attributions used to explain these differences. We use a multi-method study of university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics faculty research collaborators. We employ 177 anonymous open-ended responses to a web-based survey, and 60 semi-structured interviews of academic scientists in US research universities. We find similarities and differences in collaborative activity between men and women. Open-ended qualitative textual analysis suggests that some of these differences are attributed to power dynamics - both general ones related to differences in organizational status, and in power dynamics related specifically to gender. In analysis of semi-structured interviews, we find that both status and gender were used as interpretive frames for collaborative behavior, with more emphasis placed on status than gender differences. Overall, the findings support that gender structures some part of the collaborative experience, but that status hierarchy exerts more clear effects.",2016,,SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE,46,4,536-558,WOS:000382951600003,10.1177/0306312716652249,,#582,Gaughan 2016,"",""
Investigating strategies of pre-tenure women engineering faculty to overcome microaggressions in the classroom,"IEEE; Berdanier, CGP; Baluni, S; Whitehair, C","Though considerable attention and resources have been dedicated over a few decades to improve the representation of women in engineering fields, the issues of underrepresentation still exist, especially among the tenure track and research faculty. ""Chilly"" climate models of underrepresentation discuss these and other barriers to women's persistence, including implicit gender bias in the department. For women of color in faculty roles, these biases overlap to become serious barriers to persistence. Microaggressions in the classroom can lead to depreciation of contributions of women faculty, disregarding their accomplishments and limiting their effectiveness within social and educational contexts. One area that is underexplored are the microaggressions that occur intentionally or unintentionally in the engineering classroom when (young) women faculty teach upper-level or graduate courses in traditionally gendered subjects such as internal combustion engines, computer programming, or rocket propulsion. The purpose of this research is to qualitatively investigate experiences and strategies that junior women faculty in engineering disciplines use in the classroom to overcome student bias and microaggressions through content analysis of semi-structured interview data.

#Shemergency: Use of a Professional Development Group to Promote Female Resident Recruitment and Retention,"Khatri, UG; Love, J; Zeidan, A; Hsu, CH; Mills, AM","ProblemGender inequity in academic medicine is a pervasive challenge. Recommendations have been implemented to reduce inequities for female faculty. However, there are no well-established guidelines for the recruitment and retention of female residents.ApproachTo address challenges faced by female physicians and support the recruitment and retention of female residents, female emergency medicine residents and attending physicians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania formed a professional development group (PDG), #Shemergency, in July 2017. From July 2017 to July 2018, this PDG developed events and initiatives for female residents that addressed methods to improve awareness of and develop skills relevant to well-described gender disparities in mentorship, speakership and conference representation, compensation, evaluations, wellness and service, and award recognition.OutcomesOver its first year (July 2017-July 2018), the PDG created a professional community and enhanced mentorship through a number of events and initiatives. The PDG secured funding for 5 residents to attend a national conference and nominated 5 residents and 2 attending physicians for professional organization awards (4 nominees won).Next StepsAfter the first year, the PDG expanded the number of joint activities with both male and female colleagues and organized a citywide event for female residents and faculty representing 5 different residency programs. Future work will focus on sustainability (e.g., holding fundraising events), generalizability (e.g., expanding the gender-disparity areas addressed as well as spreading the model to other programs), developing additional events and initiatives (e.g., expanding the number of joint activities with male colleagues), and outcome assessments (e.g., distributing pre- and postevent surveys).",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,2,216-220,WOS:000529216900019,10.1097/ACM.0000000000002969,,#584,Khatri 2020,"",""
Gender inequality in leadership and academic rank in academic reproductive endocrinology programs,"Selter, JH; Spurlin, EE; Brady, PC","Purpose To identify gender differences in leadership and academic rank within academic reproductive endocrinology (REI) programs with fellowships in the USA. Methods Official institutional websites of the 2017-2018 American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG)-accredited reproductive endocrinology fellowship programs were reviewed, and gender representation at each leadership position and academic rank (Division and Fellowship Director and Full, Associate, and Assistant Professor) was recorded.

REACHING TO THE TOP: THE GENDER EFFECT IN HIGHLY-RANKED ACADEMICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE,"Jaramillo, AM; Macedo, M; Menezes, R","Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines are notorious for gender imbalance favouring men. From these, Computer Science appears to among the worst. The imbalance comes despite the fact that, the proportion of women publishing impactful papers has increased over the last couple of decades. Here, we explore the potential gender differences in collaboration dynamics of leading academics in Computer Science and contrast it with other researchers in the same discipline. This work aims to demonstrate that productivity patterns differ between men and women; understanding such patterns is fundamental to improving the current situation by driving well-thought interventions. We start by looking at topological features of academics ego-networks and their variability over their career lifespan; we found that women have a higher rate of repeated collaborators, while men have slightly more new collaborators. Second, we show gender differences in the acquisition patterns and maintenance of collaborations over the researchers' careers. Third, we look at alters' gender composition and gender role in introducing new collaborations to researchers and found that women are more homophilic than men and that the gender of the person being introduced (alter) tends to match the gender of the ego (the researcher). Last, we show that women reach their highest productivity levels earlier in their careers than men, but the levels attained are not at the same magnitude as men. Our work highlights the importance of studying gender differences by productivity levels, the role of gender-mixed groups in academia and the relation to academic production within these groups.

Addressing Gender Disparity: Increase in Female Leadership Increases Gender Equality in Program Director and Fellow Ranks,"Sethi, S; Edwards, J; Webb, A; Mendoza, S; Kumar, A; Chae, S","Introduction Women make up 15% of the total number of practicing gastroenterology (GI) physicians in the US. Despite this disparity, only 33% of the current GI fellows are female. Increasing female GIs is a major goal of all four GI societies. It is known that gender disparity exists in the field of gastroenterology, and women are underrepresented in the leadership ranks and trainee level at academic programs. Whether an increase in female leadership in academic medicine is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship in GI. Materials and Methods Data were collected via a standardized protocol from all 173 US gastroenterology fellowship programs up until October 2018 from program websites and supplemented by online surveys completed by program coordinators. Any missing information was collected by calling the program coordinators. Data were collected on gender and academic rank of the program director, associate program director, division chief, chair of medicine, program size, academic center affiliation, number, and academic rank of female faculty and geographic region. The association was assessed using a Chi-square test or independent samples t test. Results In leadership positions, men were listed as comprising 86% of chairs, 82% of division chiefs, 76% of program directors and 63% of associate program directors. Forty-three percent of programs did not have female representation at any leadership level. The presence of a female program director or female associate program director was associated with an increase in the number of female fellows (4.03 vs 3.20; p = 0.076; 4.26 vs 3.36; p = 0.041), respectively. Overall, the presence of a female in any leadership position led to an increase in the number of female fellows (4.04 females vs 2.87 females; p = 0.007) enrolled in a program. If a GI division chief was male, the program director was more likely to be male as well (81% male vs. 18.8% female). Conversely, having a female division chief was likely to lead to a more equitable program director representation, 54% female to 48% male (p value < 0.0001, OR 5.03 95% CI 2.04-12.3). Furthermore, if either the internal medicine department chair or GI chief was female, the proportion of female program directors increased to 41% as compared to 19% if both were male (p value < 0.0001, OR 2.99 95% CI 1.34-6.6). Conclusion Women are significantly underrepresented in the number of practicing gastroenterologists, at all levels of leadership in GI fellowship programs, and at the fellow level. Increasing the number of women in fellowship leadership positions is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees. Per our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between female leadership in fellowship programs and the gender of trainees. Increasing female representation in leadership positions would not only address current gender disparity, but it may also increase the number of female future GI trainees.",2022,,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES,67,2,357-363,WOS:000605117400006,10.1007/s10620-020-06686-5,,#591,Sethi 2022,"",""

Each radiologist's academic rank, departmental leadership position (executive-level - Chair, Director, Chief, and Department or Division Head vs vice-level - vice, assistant, or associate positions of executive level), self-identified gender, years in practice, and measures of scholarly productivity (number of publications, citations, and h-index) were compiled from institutional websites, Doximity, LinkedIn, Scopus, and official NPI profiles. The primary outcome, gender composition differences in these cohorts, was analyzed using Chi(2) while continuous data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The adjusted gender difference for all factors was determined using a multivariate logistic regression model.Results: Overall, 5086 academic radiologists (34.7% women) with a median 14 years of practice (YOP) were identified and indexed.

Gender Equity of Promoting Practices in Academic Neurosurgery in the United States,"Kearns, KN; Rabinovich, EP; Shabo, L; Shaffrey, ME; Jane, JA; Park, MS","BACKGROUND: Women have historically been underrepresented in academic medicine, particularly in surgical subspecialties. This study investigated potential associations between gender and promoting practices in academic neurosurgery. METHODS: Faculty data, including time from residency, professorship, specialty, and h-index, were obtained from websites of the institutions listed in the American Association of Neurological Surgeons Neurosurgical Residency Training Program Directory. Demographics, training, and appointments were compared between male and female neurosurgeons. Predictors of professorship, chair, directorship, and division leadership were identified using multivariable models. RESULTS: The study examined 1629 faculty members. Women were more likely to be assistant professors (P < 0.0001), while men were more likely to be full professors (P < 0.0001), hold chair positions (P = 0.007), lead subspecialty divisions (P = 0.008), and have a higher Scopus h index (P < 0.0001). In a multivariable analysis, years from training (P < 0.001), fellowship (P = 0.009), h-index (P < 0.001), and chair/program director/division leadership position (P < 0.001) were significant positive predictors of full professorship. Holding additional advanced degrees (P = 0.010), leading a subspecialty division (P = 0.005), and having a higher h-index (P = 0.002) positively predicted chair position.

Gender distribution and NIH funding rank in dermatology leadership: a cross-sectional analysis,"Viveiros, MD; Awethe, Z; Kaffenberger, J","In examining the influence of National Institute of Health (NIH) funding on gender distribution within dermatology leadership roles, a cross-sectional analysis of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited dermatology residencies was conducted. The gender of leadership faculty was verified using online resources, while institutions were categorized by their 2022 NIH dermatology funding status. Results revealed that male dermatologists predominantly occupied department chair roles, whereas female dermatologists were more frequently found in associate program director roles, regardless of funding status. Notably, women held most program director positions in the top NIH-funded group, though this difference was not statistically significant due to a smaller sample size. The overall gender distribution has shown progress from 2021, with a significant rise in female associate program directors and a narrowing gender gap for chairs and program directors.

The purpose of our investigation was to study gender inequity in academic radiology in North America, by assessing and comparing the gender basis of academic rank and leadership roles as related to research productivity. Materials and Methods The Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FRIEDA) and Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) were searched to generate a database of gender and academic profiles of radiology faculty members across academic institutions in North America. Bibliometric data were collected utilizing Elsevier's SCOPUS as the reference source. Descriptive analytics were assessed using the SPSS (IBM, NY). Results Of 151 academic radiology institutions across North America, academic rank information was available for 2679 radiologists of which 66.7% (1787/2679) were men and 33.3% were women (892/2679).

Gender Distribution of Authors of Evaluation Letters for Promotion at One Medical School,"Logeais, ME; Eckerstorfer, M; Krohn, KM; Everson-Rose, SA; Termuhlen, AM; Joseph, AM","PurposeWomen remain underrepresented in key leadership positions and advanced ranks in academic medicine. This study examines the numbers of men and women letter writers for promotion candidates during a 5-year period across departments, tracks, ranks, and candidate gender. MethodA descriptive study characterized the gender of evaluation letter writers for candidates for promotion to associate or full professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School between 2015 and 2020. Letter writer and candidate gender were characterized by self-identified pronouns in the faculty biography or dossier. Letter writer gender was described by candidate department, promotion track, rank, terminal degree, and gender. ResultsAmong 299 candidates for promotion, 172 (58%) were men and 127 (42%) were women; dossiers included 3,995 evaluation letters. Across all years, men wrote more letters than women (external letters, range, 69% in 2019-2020 to 75% in 2015-2016; internal letters, range, 67% in 2018-2019 to 77% in 2015-2016). Candidates in the family medicine and pediatrics departments had the highest percentages of letters written by women (44% and 40%, respectively). No differences were found in the number of women letter writers by candidate promotion track; however, differences were found by candidate rank (associate professor, 30%; full professor, 23%) and terminal degree (MD/DO, 25%; PhD, 33%; MD-PhD, 20%). Regardless of candidate gender, most evaluation letters were written by men. Women candidates had 15% to 20% more letters authored by women than men candidates (34%-40% vs 18%-23%).

Effects of sexual harassment on advancement of women in academic medicine: A multi-institutional longitudinal study,"Raj, A; Freund, KM; McDonald, JM; Carr, PL","Background: Sexual harassment of women in academic medicine may impede advancement and productivity. This study analyzes the longitudinal effects of sexual harassment on academic advancement and productivity among women.Methods: We undertook a longitudinal analysis to predict effects of sexual harassment reported in 1995 on career outcomes measured in 2012-13, among a sample of women in academic medicine (N =1273) recruited from 24 U.S. medical schools. Measures included survey data from 1995 on sexual harassment (predictor), and 2012-2013 data on retention in academic medicine, rank, leadership positions, and refereed publications (outcomes), captured from surveys and public records. We used multivariable models to test effects of sexual harassment on study outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographics, employment-related variables, and gender discrimination.Findings: In 1995, 54% of women reported any workplace sexual harassment, and 32% of women reported severe harassment (e.g., threats or coercive sexual advances) in the workplace. Multivariable regression models showed no significant effects of sexual harassment. However, severe sexual harassment was associated with higher odds of attaining full professorship by 2012-2013 (AOR: 1.70; 95% CI 1.03, 2.80; p = 0.04).Interpretation: Contrary to our hypothesis, women reporting severe workplace harassment in 1995 were more rather than less likely to advance to full professor. Women seeking advancement may be more vulnerable to sexual harassment in academic medicine vis a vis greater exposure to those who abuse their position of authority.

The Spanish Equality Law and the Gender Balance in the Evaluation Committees: An Opportunity for Women's Promotion in Higher Education,"Ramos, AMG; Carpintero, EC; Peregort, OP; Solvas, MT","Despite advances in gender policy and equality laws in the twenty-first century, women are still a minority in the full professor category in Europe. Some measures establish gender quotas to balance gatekeeper positions, which will supposedly pave the way to make women's integration into senior higher education positions easier. In Spain, Organic Act 3/2007(1) of 22 March on effective equality between women and men launched progressive norms governing gender issues, and the Spanish Science and Technology Act (2011) incorporated measures to promote effective equality in academic institutions. This paper evaluates how Spanish evaluation agencies' compliance with implementing gender balance has affected the composition of evaluation committees and its impact on the advancement of women in science. Findings reveal some positive figures on women's representation in recent decades, even though gender-balanced committees do not show any clear evidence of causing this effect. There seems to be no correlation between gender-balanced committees and women's success rates, suggesting intermediate variables affect women's low participation in competitive submissions.

Materials and Methods: Open-ended text responses to a 2013 faculty engagement survey were analyzed by using the grounded theory and consensual qualitative analysis techniques. The authors grouped 491 faculty's text responses into descriptive codes and three themes: (1) No Obstacles, (2) Barriers to Success, and (3) Concerns Regarding Processes. Demographics of codes were compared by using chi-square analysis. Results: Male faculty identified barriers that included negative views of leadership or leaders. Female faculty, especially those in clinical roles, expressed barriers related to role overload, including that the demands of their current positions prevented advancement or addition of further roles, no matter how desirable further roles may be. Women also shared that considerable self-promotion was required to receive acknowledgement of their work and support by leadership. Conclusion: A proposed framework depicts male and female faculty's concerns on a continuum. No Obstacle and Process Concerns were relatively gender neutral, whereas large gender disparities occurred within the Barriers to Success theme. Women's barriers largely revolved around internal obstacles (I can't do any more), and men's barriers largely revolved around external factors (leaders are impeding my progress).

DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH -PROMOTING LIFESTYLE PROFILE AMONG CROATIAN MEDICAL STUDENTS ACCORDING TO GENDER AND YEAR OF STUDY,"Masina, T; Madzar, T; Musil, V; Milosevic, M","Increasing awareness of healthy lifestyle is important during the period of adolescence because habits are difficult to modify in adulthood. The aim of the study was to examine gender differences in health-promoting lifestyle among medical students and to analyze changes between the first and second year of the study. This cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 1186 students (36% male). Data were collected by self-administered anonymous questionnaire, the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile [HPLP II] (Adult Version), and analyzed by descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. The 941 HPLP II questionnaires were collected and analyzed (79% response rate). Both genders showed a medium level HPLP II total score (male M=2.68; IQR=2.42-2.92 vs. female M=2.65; IQR=2.46-2.90), without significant gender difference. A significantly higher score was observed in the subscales on health responsibility (p=0.027) and interpersonal relations (p<0.001) among female compared to male students, and a significantly higher score in the subscales on physical activity (p<0.001) and stress management (p=0.025) among male compared to female students.

Trends Among Women in Academic Medicine Faculty Ranks,"Collazo, A; Yu, XY; Jan, QRTLN; Xie, CZ; Campbell, KM","Introduction: Similar proportions of women and men have entered medical school since 2003. However, career advancement and promotion for women continues to be fraught with disparities and inequalities. Building on current literature, this study explores the rates of change of female faculty in faculty ranks over the last 10 years to gain a more comprehensive view of the faculty trends of women in academic medicine.Methods: Using the Faculty Administrative Management Online User System database, counts by gender and faculty rank at each Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) academic medical school were obtained. Statistical analysis was done using generalized estimating equations modeling to assess rates of change for each gender from 2012 to 2021.Results: Higher proportions of female faculty are concentrated at the Instructor and Assistant Professor level and lower proportions at the Associate Professor and Professor rank compared to male faculty. Over the study period, female faculty showed increased rate change compared to male faculty of 1.007 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002-1.012) for Associate Professor rank and 1.012 (95% CI: 1.007-1.016) for Professor rank. At the Instructor and Assistant Professor levels, female faculty decreased at a relative rate of 0.980 (95% CI: 0.969-0.990) and 0.995 (95% CI: 0.992-0.997) each year, respectively.Conclusion: Female faculty continue to be concentrated at the junior faculty rank.

A Survey of the Barriers Affecting the Career Practice and Promotions of Female Dentists in Saudi Arabia,"Rajeh, M; Nicolau, B; Qutob, A; Pluye, P; Esfandiari, S","Introduction: Over the last 40 y, the proportion of women in the profession of dentistry has been growing steadily. The extant literature, although limited, demonstrates that gender differences exist in choice of specialization, practice pattern, and professional attitudes, revealing that women are more likely to work in primary dental care and are less prominent in other dental specialties. Female Saudi dentists, working in the government sector, tend to occupy lower positions in the occupational hierarchy, are paid less, and are less likely to hold consultant positions as compared with men.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to identify barriers faced by female dentists practicing in Saudi Arabia in seeking professional advancement and to determine the variables that influenced respondents' promotions.Methods: In February 2017, a web-based cross-sectional survey was emailed to all female dentists registered with the Saudi Dental Society (N = 2,651). Completed questionnaires (N = 130, response rate = 7.1%) were analyzed with simple summary statistics and a logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between the dependent variable (promotion) and independent variables (family, environmental, interpersonal, and cultural factors). Results: Most female dentists believed that family, environmental, and cultural factors are challenges to their career practice and progression. Other factors included interpersonal challenges, such as gender discrimination and male dominance in the field of dentistry. Results of the regression analysis revealed that family and environmental factors were significant predictors of whether female dentists would be promoted.Conclusion: Saudi female dentists continue to face significant obstacles in their career practice and advancement. Their role in the workplace needs to be recognized. Factors that obstruct their career advancement should be well understood by dental institutions and efforts should be made to move more female dentists into leadership positions.Knowledge Transfer Statement: Policy makers can use the results of this study to develop strategies to overcome the barriers faced by female dentists in Saudi Arabia with respect to their professional and personal (family) needs.

Advancing Women in Oceanography How NSF's ADVANCE Program Promotes Gender Equity in Academia,"Holmes, MA","Gender equity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has remained elusive because there are multiple causes of inequity that interact in complex ways. These causes have been the subject of interdisciplinary research funded by the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE program. Outcomes demonstrate that some barriers to women's retention in faculty and leadership positions in STEM result from individual challenges, such as lack of networks, mentors, and advocates. Some barriers result from interactional challenges among colleagues, such as implicit assumptions about who ""does"" science. And some barriers are institutional, the product of a system designed for men with families to support their personal lives. Solutions designed by research address one or more of these causes with source-specific interventions. For individual barriers, professional development workshops help make the implicit explicit. For interactional barriers, learning about implicit bias can reduce its impact. For institutional barriers, policy review and reform, such as enacting stop-the-tenure clock and dual-career policies, make the academy more people-friendly. To include as many excellent minds as possible in the STEM enterprise, it is necessary to transform the institution, not ""fix the women."" Such transformation must be well thought out and purposefully enacted.

Women's Bragging Rights: Overcoming Modesty Norms to Facilitate Women's Self-Promotion,"Smith, JL; Huntoon, M","Within American gender norms is the expectation that women should be modest. We argue that violating this modesty norm by boasting about one's accomplishments causes women to experience uncomfortable situational arousal that leads to lower motivation for and performance on a self-promotion task. We hypothesized that such negative effects could be offset when an external source for their situational arousal was made available. To test hypotheses, 78 women students from a U.S. Northwestern university wrote a scholarship application essay to promote the merits of either the self (modesty norm violated) or another person as a letter of reference (modesty norm not violated). Half were randomly assigned to hear information about a (fake) subliminal noise generator in the room that might cause discomfort (misattribution available) and half were told nothing about the generator (normal condition: misattribution not available). Participants rated the task and 44 new naive participants judged how much scholarship money to award each essay. Results confirmed predictions: under normal conditions, violating the modesty norm led to decreased motivation and performance. However, those who violated the modesty norm with a misattribution source reported increased interest, adopted fewer performance-avoidance goals, perceived their own work to be of higher quality, and produced higher quality work. Results suggest that when a situation helps women to escape the discomfort of defying the modesty norm, self-promotion motivation and performance improve.

These forms of leave are intended to support equity, and particularly gender equity. A key question is how the actual use of leave affects critical milestones of advancement for women-compared to men-in (1) time to tenure and (2) the odds of promotion to full professor. We address this question with descriptive statistics and event history analyses, based on responses to a survey of 3688 US faculty members in 4 scientific fields within a range of Carnegie institutional types. We find that leave that stops the tenure clock extends time to tenure for both men and women-the effect is gender neutral. Promotion to full professor is another matter. Being a woman has a strong negative effect on the likelihood of promotion to full professor, and women are especially disadvantaged in promotion when they used tenure leave years earlier.

Women accounted for fewer positions than men for resident/chancellor (23.8% vs 76.2%; p value<0.001), vice-president/vice-chancellor (36.3% vs 63.7%; p value<0.001), vice provost (42.7% vs 57.3%; p value=0.06), dean (38.5% vs 61.5%; p value<0.001) and associate dean (48.2% vs 51.8%; p-value=0.05). Women however were in a greater proportion in the assistant dean positions (63.8% vs 36.2%; p value<0.001). Conclusion Leadership gender imbalance is trans-organisational and transnational within the top 50 universities of North America and progressively widens towards the top leadership pyramid. This correlates with the lack of women leadership progress and sustainability in later cycles of the leadership continuum model (beyond assistant dean).",2022,,POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL,98,1163,705-709,WOS:000726870400001,10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139615,,#645,Azizi 2022,"",""
Gender-based Barriers in the Advancement of Women Leaders in Emergency Medicine: A Multi-institutional Qualitative Study,"Graham, E; Ferrel, M; Wells, K; Egan, D; MacVane, C; Gisondi, M; Burns, B; Madsen, T; Fix, M","Introduction: Leadership positions occupied by women within academic emergency medicine have remained stagnant despite increasing numbers of women with faculty appointments. We distributed a multi-institutional survey to women faculty and residents to evaluate categorical characteristics contributing to success and differences between the two groups.Methods: An institutional review board-approved electronic survey was distributed to women faculty and residents at eight institutions and were completed anonymously. We created survey questions to assess multiple categories: determination; resiliency; career support and obstacles; career aspiration; and gender discrimination. Most questions used a Likert five-point scale. Responses for each question and category were averaged and deemed significant if the average was greater than or equal to 4 in the affirmative, or less than or equal to 2 in the negative. We calculated proportions for binary questions.Results: The overall response rate was 55.23% (95/172). The faculty response rate was 54.1% (59/109) and residents' response rate was 57.1% (36/63). Significant levels of resiliency were reported, with a mean score of 4.02. Childbearing and rearing were not significant barriers overall but were more commonly reported as barriers for faculty over residents (P<0.001). Obstacles reported included a lack of confidence during work-related negotiations and insufficient research experience. Notably, 68.4% (65/95) of respondents experienced gender discrimination and 9.5% (9/95) reported at least one encounter of sexual assault by a colleague or supervisor during their career.Conclusion: Targeted interventions to promote female leadership in academic emergency medicine include coaching on negotiation skills, improved resources and mentorship to support research, and enforcement of safe work environments.

Sexual Orientation Differences in Adolescent Health Care Access and Health-Promoting Physician Advice,"Luk, JW; Gilman, SE; Haynie, DL; Simons-Morton, BG","Purpose: Physician screening and advice on health-related behaviors are an integral part of adolescent health care. Sexual minority adolescents encounter more barriers to health services; yet, no prior research has examined whether they also experience disparity in physician screening and advice. We examined possible sexual orientation disparities in health care access, physician screening, and advice on six health-related behaviors.Methods: Data were from a national sample of U.S. adolescents who participated in wave 2 of the NEXT Generation Health Study (n = 2023). Poisson regressions were conducted separately for males and females to estimate sexual orientation differences in health care access and health-related screening and advice.Results: Compared with heterosexual males, sexual minority males were more likely to report unmet medical needs in the past year (adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 2.23) but did not differ with respect to receiving physician advice concerning health-related behaviors. Compared with heterosexual females, sexual minority females were more likely to report no routine physical checkup in the past year (ARR = 1.67) but were more likely to receive physician advice to reduce or stop drinking, smoking, drug use, increase physical activity, and improve diet (ARRs = 1.56-1.99), even after controlling for corresponding health-related behaviors. Sexual minority females were also more likely to receive advice about risk associated with sexual behavior (ARR = 1.35) and advice to avoid sexually transmitted diseases (ARR = 1.49).Conclusions: Both sexual minority males and females experienced disparities in some aspects of health care access. Improved health-promoting advice would better serve sexual minority males.

The purpose of this study is to describe the gender representation in academic gastroenterology (GI) and compare publication productivity, academic rank, and career duration between male and female gastroenterologists.MethodIn 2014, the authors collected data including number of publications, career duration, h-index, and m-index for faculty members at 114 U.S. academic GI programs.ResultsOf 2,440 academic faculty, 1,859 (76%) were men and 581 (24%) were women. Half (50%) of men held senior faculty position compared with 29% of women (P < .001). Compared with female faculty, male faculty had significantly (P < .001) longer careers (20 vs. 11 years), more publications (median 24 [0-949] vs. 9 [0-438]), and higher h-indices (8 vs. 4).

Promoting Inclusive Environments: In-group Organizational Endorsement as a Tool to Increase Feelings of Identity-Safety among Black Women,"Burrows, D; Pietri, ES; Johnson, IR; Ashburn-Nardo, L","Black women face unique and harmful biases because of their intersecting and multiple marginalized identities, which are different from those experienced by Black men and White women (Crenshaw in s. Cal. l. Rev., 65, 1467., 1991). As organizations work to create more inclusive environments for minoritized employees, it is important to test effective messaging and identity-safe cues (i.e., cues that enhance feelings of identity acceptance) for Black women. In the current research, we investigate a new identity-safe cue - in-group organizational endorsement. This technique involves two components: (a) learning about the successful experiences of a former Black female employee and (b) a persuasive message asserting that out-group employees can be supportive role models and mentors within the organization. In a pilot experiment (N = 182) and Study 1 (N = 236), Black female participants were more likely to believe role models and mentors can have different identities, to anticipate more identity-safety, and to have higher attraction to an organization that was endorsed by a former Black female employee compared to a White woman employee. Study 2 (N = 214) further demonstrated that in-group organizational endorsement was effective among Black female students early in their college career. Relative to a control group, Black female students in their 1(st) - 3(rd) year who received the in-group endorsement intervention indicated higher identity-safety at their university and were more likely to pursue professional interactions with out-group members.

There are few guidelines in place defining organization-level factors that promote a supportive workplace environment beneficial to women in emergency medicine (EM). We assembled a working group with the goal of developing specific and feasible recommendations to support women's professional development in both community and academic EM settings.MethodsWe formed a working group from the leadership of two EM women's organizations, the Academy of Women in Academic Emergency Medicine (AWAEM) and the American Association of Women Emergency Physicians (AAWEP). Through a literature search and discussion, working group members identified four domains where organizational policies and practices supportive of women were needed: 1) global approaches to supporting the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in EM; 2) recruitment, hiring, and compensation of women emergency physicians; 3) supporting development and advancement of women in EM; and 4) physician health and wellness (in the context of pregnancy, childbirth, and maternity leave). Within each of these domains, the working group created an initial set of specific recommendations. The working group then recruited a stakeholder group of EM physician leaders across the country, selecting for diversity in practice setting, geographic location, age, race, and gender. Stakeholders were asked to score and provide feedback on each of the recommendations. Specific recommendations were retained by the working group if they achieved high rates of approval from the stakeholder group for importance and perceived feasibility.

They expressed data as whole numbers and percent female. A trend analysis projected time to gender parity across rank and tenure categories, and cross-tabulation analysis revealed the relative odds of females being in a rank and tenure position relative to males.ResultsA 12-fold increase in the number of faculty occurred from 1966 to 2019, driven largely by increases in nontenure track faculty. Female tenured and tenure track numbers increased at consistent rates (121 and 174 per year; P < .001). Female non-tenure track rates mirrored those for males, both changing in 2000. Odds ratios in 2019 for BSc and CSc females to be in tenure track versus non-tenure track positions compared with males were 0.83/0.98 and to be tenured were 0.63/0.44.

Gender dynamics and academic rank in emergency medicine collaboration networks: A social network and gender propensity analysis,"Walker, LE; Heaton, HA; Kohler, K","Background: Academic productivity is bolstered by collaboration, which is in turn related to connectivity between individuals. Gender disparities have been identi fied in academics in terms of both academic promotion and output. Using gender propensity and network analysis, we aimed to describe patterns of collaboration on publications in emergency medicine (EM), focusing on two Midwest academic departments. Methods: We identi fied faculty at two EM departments, their academic rank, and their publications from 2020 to 2022 and gathered information on their co-authors. Using network analysis, gender propensity and standard statistical analyses we assessed the collaboration network for differences between men and women. Results: Social network analysis of collaboration in academic emergency medicine showed no difference in the ways that men and women publish together. However, individuals with higher academic rank, regardless of gender, had more importance to the network. Men had a propensity to collaborate with men, and women with women. The rates of gender propensity for men and women fell between the gender ratios of emergency medicine (65% /35%) and the general population (50%/50%), 59.6% and 44%, respectively, suggesting a tendency toward homophily among men. Conclusion: Our study aims to use network analysis and gender propensity to identify patterns of collaboration. We found that further work in the area of network analysis application to academic productivity may be of value, with a particular focus on the role of academic rank. Our methodology may aid department leaders by using the information from local analyses to identify opportunities to support faculty members to broaden and diversify their networks.

School tenure and student achievement,"Fan, W","While much empirical research concerns job tenure, this paper introduces the concept of school tenure and further examines whether and how school tenure impacts student outcomes using a rich set of cohort data from England's secondary schools. Using the number of times a student switched schools during the academic year as an instrument to measure school tenure to fully account for endogeneity issues, the resulting two-stage least squares estimates suggest that the effects of school tenure are positive and heterogeneous across students. While advantaged students are more likely to gain when their own school tenure is longer, disadvantaged students benefit if their peers have longer tenure. This significant heterogeneous effect suggests that school tenure may not simply act as the inverse of school mobility but may represent a potential determinant of student achievement and an effective school-specific measure for policymakers and practitioners.

Top of the Class: The Importance of Ordinal Rank,"Murphy, R; Weinhardt, F","This article establishes a new fact about educational production: ordinal academic rank during primary school has lasting impacts on secondary school achievement that are independent of underlying ability. Using data on the universe of English school students, we exploit naturally occurring differences in achievement distributions across primary school classes to estimate the impact of class rank. We find large effects on test scores, confidence, and subject choice during secondary school, even though these students have a new set of peers and teachers who are unaware of the students' prior ranking in primary school. The effects are especially pronounced for boys, contributing to an observed gender gap in the number of Maths courses chosen at the end of secondary school. Using a basic model of student effort allocation across subjects, we distinguish between learning and non-cognitive skills mechanisms, finding support for the latter.",2020,,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,87,6,2777-2826,WOS:000613723100011,10.1093/restud/rdaa020,,#668,Murphy 2020,"",""
Promotion Disparities in Academic Urology,"Breyer, BN; Butler, C; Fang, R; Meeks, W; Porten, SP; North, AC; Anger, JT","OBJECTIVE To better understand promotion timelines across gender and race/ethnicity and how academic output impacts promotion in urology.METHODS We examined the 2017 census. An academic subset was asked questions regarding their promotion timeline. We obtained demographic, academic output, and family responsibility data.RESULTS Of 2926 academic urologists who identified a position of Assistant, Associate, or Full professor, 11.2% were women, 75% were White, and 94% were non-Hispanic. Men authored more papers and achieved principal investigator status more often than women. Non-Hispanics authored more papers than Hispanics. On average, women took 1.2 years longer than men to advance from Assistant to Associate Professor (7.3 years [95% CI: 6.8-7.8] vs 6.1 years, [95% CI: 5.8-6.6, P <.001]). Advancement from Associate to Full Professor was similar between women and men (6.0 years [95% CI: 5.1-6.9] vs 6.6 [95% CI: 6.1-7.1, P =.25]). Compared to women, men were more likely to experience rapid promotion (<= 4 years) to Associate Professor (odds ratio 3 [95% CI: 1.8-5.1]). There was no statistical difference across race/ethnicity for promotion from Assistant to Associate, Associate to Full Professor, or rapid promotion.CONCLUSION We identified disparities in promotion times based on gender but not race and ethnicity. The number of under-represented minority faculty in urology is low. Understanding the causes of disparities should be a priority in order to support fair promotion practices and retention of diverse faculty.

Investigation of the Gender Distribution of National Institutes of Health Grants Across Six Surgical Specialties From 2015 to 2020: Toward Promoting Equity in Academic Surgery,"Lin, IC; Bisbee, C; Sutherland, M; Santiesteban, L; Pasarin, A; McKenney, M; Elkbuli, A","Introduction: There is a paucity of literature evaluating research-funding differences between male and female surgeons. Our study aims to evaluate possible disparities in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant awards by surgeon gender, type of medical degree (MD/DO), and advanced degrees among six surgery specialties: general surgeons, neurosurgeons, urologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, plastic, and orthopedic surgeons, from 2015 to 2020.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed investigating the number of NIH grants received by male and female surgeon-scientists overall and within each listed specialty, 2015-2020. As a surrogate for grants submitted, the proportion of active surgeon scientists per specialty was used. A priori level of significance was defined as P < 0.05.Results: After adjusting for confounders, male surgeons had a higher mean number of NIH grants and higher grant funding than female surgeons (P < 0.001 for both). Type of medical degree (MD/DO) was not significantly associated with NIH funding. An advanced degree was associated with NIH funding among neurosurgeons only (P < 0.05). Differences in the proportion of active surgeon-scientists and proportion of NIH grants received by male and female surgeon-scientists were found only in the fields of orthopedic surgery (5.8% female surgeons and received 20.7% of grants, P = 0.003) and plastic surgery (17.2% female surgeons and received 33.3% of grants, P = 0.01).Conclusions: Male surgeons received most of the total surgical NIH grants. However, funding for female surgeons in orthopedic and plastic surgery outpaces that of their male counterparts when compared to gender proportions in their respective field. Future studies should further investigate the effects of additional applicant demographics on securing NIH grant funding.

"Novel, Low-Cost Intervention to Promote Women's Advancement in Global Health Research","Walsh, KF; Fahme, S; Reif, LK; Mathad, J; Konopasek, L; Downs, JA","Problem Women comprise 7 out of every 10 health care workers globally yet are significantly underrepresented in leadership positions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated underlying gender disparities, placing additional burdens on many female global health professionals. Approach The authors describe the development of a novel, low-cost pilot program-the Female Global Scholars Program (Weill Cornell Medicine)-established in April 2018 to promote the advancement of female global health research professionals and prepare them for leadership positions in this field. Using a logic model, the program was informed by discussion with peers at scientific symposia, qualitative research examining the barriers women experience in global health, discussions with experts in the fields of global health and medical education, and a literature review of other initiatives focused on fostering female advancement. The program provides opportunities to learn leadership skills and peer mentoring to female junior investigators in global health research over the course of 2 years through attendance of a symposium and skill-building workshop, skill-building webinars, and the building of a peer mentor group. Outcomes The inaugural cohort of the Female Global Scholars Program (April 2018-March 2020) included 10 female global health researchers from 6 countries (Haiti, India, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United States) across 3 continents. By the end of year 1, 6 participants received academic promotions. Additionally, the inaugural 10 scholars collectively presented at 11 international conferences and submitted 22 abstracts and 19 manuscripts.

"Amplifying Their Voice: Inclusive Healthcare Provider Perspectives to Improve Advancement, Resilience, and Retention","Breuner, C; Moore, E; Walsh, E; Hilman, S; Mitzel, J; Thomas, A; Walker-Harding, L","Background and objectives: Addressing the issues of workplace advancement, resilience, and retention within medicine is crucial for creating a culture of equity, respect, and inclusivity especially towards women and nonbinary (WNB) providers including advanced practice providers (APPs), most notably those from marginalized groups. This also directly impacts healthcare quality, patient outcomes, and overall patient and employee satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to amplify the voices on challenges faced by WNB providers within a pediatric academic healthcare organization, to rank workplace interventions addressing advancement, resilience, and retention highlighting urgency towards addressing these issues, and, lastly, to provide suggestions on how to improve inclusivity. Methods: Participants were self-identified WNB providers employed by a pediatric healthcare organization and its affiliated medical university.

"RELATIONS BETWEEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ACADEMIC SELF-REGULATION AND PROCRASTINATION: CONSIDERING MOTIVES AND GENDER-DIFFERENCES IN THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY HABITS","Valenzuela, R; Codina, N; Pestana, JV","Physical activity has been reported to decline in the transition from high school into university. This trend seems to be influenced by changes in society and technology. For instance, physical education and outdoors activities have been decreasing. Conversely, electronic entertainment has been increasing notably. The general decline in physical activity has been linked with health risks such as a sedentary lifestyle and obesity, but also with lesser memory, learning and concentration. However, notwithstanding these changes and associated risks, scarce attention has been paid to the relationships between university students' physical activity, and aspects like academic self-regulation and procrastination. Based on these antecedents, we analyzed women and men university students' physical activity, its characteristics and its motives, and their relationships with academic self-regulation and procrastination. Participants of the present study were (N = 783) university students (472 women and 311 men). A vast majority (95%) was 24 years old or younger (M = 20.63, SD = 6.06). Measurement instruments included the Spanish Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire (perseverance, goal setting, decision making and learning from mistakes), the Pure Procrastination Scale (implemental delay, decisional procrastination, and lateness), a self-report questionnaire regarding physical activity and its characteristics, and the Motives for Physical Activity Measure - Revised (enjoyment, competence, social, fitness, and appearance). Students' reports of physical activity were compared between the year before entering university and the year the study was conducted. Academic self-regulation and procrastination were compared between students who practiced physical activity and who did not. We also analyzed motives for physical activity and their relationships with students' academic self-regulation and procrastination. Results show that a greater percentage of men students practiced physical activity than women, both before (78.8% versus 63.6%) and during university studies (59.5% versus 41.9%), and that the decline in women students' physical activity from high school into university studies was steeper. Students who practiced physical activity scored lower on all procrastination dimensions and higher on all self-regulation dimensions except learning from mistakes. Furthermore, competence, enjoyment, and social motives for physical activity were positively associated with the amount of weekly physical activity; whereas appearance and fitness motives did not show this positive association. Our findings suggest that intrinsic motives for physical activity (competence, enjoyment, and social) may be better predictors of the amount of weekly physical practice, as well as of dimensions of academic self-regulation; whereas extrinsic motives (fitness and appearance) may play more modest roles. University higher education should promote students' healthy lifestyles and help them avoiding health risks and behaviours adverse to academic learning. However, common promotion of physical activity based on fitness motives might prove insufficient. Addressing contemporary trends in sedentary lifestyle and decreased physical activity, linked to behaviours which are adverse to learning in university studies and higher education may be critical. Universities may find it useful to address these from perspectives including considerations of gender and personal motives.",2020,,"14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)",,,7000-7005,WOS:000558088807016,,,#681,Valenzuela 2020,"",""

Extensive literature review suggests four gendered domains: first, water needs and uses; second, strategies to meet those needs by directly accessing water sources, and, with increasing wealth by investing individually or collectively in water infrastructure for self-supply, creating infrastructure-related 'commons' in the case of collective systems; third, at community scale, the 'sharing in' of communities' naturally available water resources that flow into infrastructure; and, fourth, 'sharing out' of those resources with neighbouring communities but also powerful third parties of foreign and national high impact users. Rendering the gendered community more visible as the main agent to manage its water resources as the commons provides evidence for a range of policies, laws and interventions, including gender equitable and community-led water infrastructure development integrating domestic and productive spheres; strengthening customary arrangements to share water resources as a commons within a community or with neighbouring communities, and the long overdue formal protection of customary water tenure against 'water grabs' by powerful third parties.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,17,1,1-11,WOS:000928199400001,10.5334/ijc.1164,,#682,VanKoppen 2023,"",""

Sealing the Deal: Factors That Promote Computing Interns' Interest in Computing Careers,"Assoc Computing Machinery; Lehman, KJ; Stormes, KN; Smith, KN; Lapan, JC","Although many undergraduate computing students participate in internships, little research explores these experiences. Using survey data from 1,018 undergraduate computing students at 15 U.S. research institutions and Social Cognitive Career Theory as a theoretical framework, this study explores the experiences of computing undergraduates who participated in computing internships and the extent to which their internship experiences shaped their reported interest in pursuing computing-related careers after graduation. The study investigates how students' experiences in their primary computing internship may vary by gender and racial/ethnic identities. Findings indicate that a large majority of computing students felt that their internship experiences increased their professional skills and awareness of the skills most valued in the workplace; these findings held across gender and racial/ethnic groups. However, women, particularly white and Asian women, were more likely to report that their internship helped them increase their technical skills than their male peers. Indeed, growth in one's professional skillset was the strongest predictor of students' increased interest in a computing career. Also, identifying as a woman or gender non-conforming individual, working in an internship environment with same-gender peers, and having strong computing self-efficacy were positively associated with increased interest in a computing career.

Method The authors conducted semistructured interviews with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine faculty in 2016: department chairs (sponsors) and faculty participants of an executive leadership development program (proteges). Using editing analysis style, the authors coded interview transcripts for thematic content; a coding framework and themes were derived using an iterative process. Results Five themes were identified from 23 faculty interviews (12 sponsors, 11 proteges): (1) Mentorship is different: Sponsorship is episodic and focused on specific opportunities; (2) Effective sponsors are career-established and well-connected talent scouts; (3) Effective proteges rise to the task and remain loyal; (4) Trust, respect, and weighing risks are key to successful sponsorship relationships; (5) Sponsorship is critical to career advancement. Sponsorship is distinct from mentorship, though mentors can be sponsors if highly placed and well connected. Effective sponsors have access to networks and provide unequivocal support when promoting proteges. Effective proteges demonstrate potential and make the most of career-advancing opportunities. Successful sponsorship relationships are based on trust, respect, mutual benefits, and understanding potential risks. Sponsorship is critical to advance to high-level leadership roles. Women are perceived as being less likely to seek sponsorship but as needing the extra support sponsorship provides to be successful. Conclusions Sponsorship, in addition to mentorship, is critical for successful career advancement.

Analysis of Social Policy and the Effect of Career Advancement Support Programs for Female Doctors,"Okoshi, K; Fukami, K; Tomizawa, Y","Background: In Japan, the number of female doctors has gradually increased; however, they form less than half of the average percentage (46.3% in 2016) among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. In addition, some female doctors reduce their working hours for childbirth, housework, and childcare. Thus, women find it challenging to continue medical practice in Japan. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) established a time-bound grants program from 2007 to 2009 to support female doctors and improve their working environment. This study examines the program contents and the increase in female doctors in university hospitals. Materials and Methods: Using individual data from the Survey of Physicians, Dentists, and Pharmacists from 1996 to 2016, we compared two categories of female doctors, faculty and nonfaculty members, at university hospitals that received grants compared to those that did not. In addition, we reviewed the support program for female doctors and nurses developed by nine university hospitals using content from the MEXT and information from previous studies. Results: Most programs included in-hospital childcare and shorter working hours. There were fewer women in the nine hospitals receiving grants compared to other university hospitals. There were significant differences in the percentages of male and female nonfaculty members in 2000, 2004, and 2008. Conclusions: While we could not find any evidence that programs supported by the grants could increase female doctor numbers, these programs may have improved the status of female doctors with children.

Are different entrepreneurship-promotion activities equally effective? an analysis by academic year and gender,"Padilla-Angulo, L; Díaz-Pichardo, R; Leal-Rodríguez, AL","Entrepreneurial education (EE) has proliferated in recent years, however, while previous research has extensively analyzed the impact of EE on students' entrepreneurial intentions (EI), studies tend to analyze EE as a monolithic concept without distinguishing between different types of academic activities and hence under examining how EE achieves its goals. To fill this gap in the literature, drawing on Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior and EE theory, we examine the relative effectiveness of different teaching models (supply, demand, and competence models) and specific academic activities in developing entrepreneurial intentions (EI). In particular, we focus on interdisciplinary activities (i.e., activities involving students from varying profiles and career fields), a type of academic activity that has been neglected by previous literature. We also explore potential differences in the effectiveness of these models depending on students' educational stage and gender, factors which have also been overlooked by the literature. Using survey data from 859 business school students, a structural model, and partial least squares technique, we found differences in the impact of teaching models on students' EI depending on activity characteristics, as well as student educational stage and gender. The results have important implications for educational practice and for public and private organizations interested in promoting entrepreneurship: i) the importance of autonomy, experiential learning, and exploratory learning in entrepreneurship-promotion activities, and ii) the convenience of tailoring these activities according to the gender, year of education, and academic field of the students.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,19,1,1-25,WOS:000661352500001,10.1007/s11365-021-00756-4,,#701,Padilla-Angulo 2023,"",""

A multi-year science research or engineering experience in high school gives women confidence to continue in the STEM pipeline or seek advancement in other fields: A 20-year longitudinal study,"Hunt, PK; Dong, M; Miller, CM","There remains a large gender imbalance in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce deriving from a leaky pipeline where women start losing interest and confidence in science and engineering as early as primary school. To address this disparity, the Science Research & Engineering Program (SREP) at Hathaway Brown School was established in 1998 to engage and expose their all-female high school students to STEM fields through an internship-like multi-year research experience at partnering institutions. We compare data from existing Hathaway Brown School SREP alumnae records from 1998-2018 (n = 495) to Non-SREP students and national datasets (National Center for Educational Statistics, National Science Foundation, and US Census data) to assess how SREP participation may influence persistence in the STEM pipeline and whether SREP alumnae attribute differences in these outcomes to the confidence and skill sets they learned from the SREP experience. The results reveal that women who participate in the SREP are more likely to pursue a major in a STEM field and continue on to a STEM occupation compared to non-SREP students, national female averages, and national subsets. Participants attribute their outcomes to an increase in confidence, establishment of technical and professional skills, and other traits strengthened through the SREP experience.

Exploring the Effectiveness of a Scientific Inquiry Creative Workshop in Promoting Senior and Vocational High School Students' Scientific Inquiry Self-efficacy,"Lu, YY; Lin, HS; Lin, FL; Hong, ZR","Background and Purpose The Ministry of Education in Taiwan officially launched the 12-year National Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines in 2019. The core purpose of the 12-year national education curriculum is to cultivate people-oriented lifelong learners. Specifically, learning is no longer limited by subject knowledge and skills; instead, it should cultivate student competency to solve problems, conduct inquiries, analyze data, and critically examine findings to solve problems and achieve self-growth (Ministry of Education, 2021). To cultivate student scientific inquiry literacy, this study hosted a 1-day scientific inquiry creative workshop (SICW) in northern, central, and southern Taiwan on October 17 and 18, 2020. The main purposes of this study were to improve student scientific inquiry self-efficacy through the SICW, to determine the differential performance of students with different backgrounds, and to explore the key factors related to student scientific inquiry self-efficacy.Literature Review The PISA 2015 results revealed no significant differences in the scientific self-efficacy of 15-year-old male and female students in Taiwan (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015). However, clear gender differences were noted in the choice of higher education academic fields between male and female students (Lin & Tsai, 2018). Accordingly, gender influences student scientific inquiry self-efficacy. In addition, Chang (2013) reported that the uneven distribution of educational resources between the north and the south of Taiwan also exerts a considerable effect on student learning motivation and learning self-efficacy. Therefore, to understand the scientific inquiry self-efficacy of students with different background variables after participating in the SICW, we proposed the following research hypothesis (H1): Significant regional, gender, and motivation differences exist in student scientific inquiry self-efficacy after participating in the SICW.Studies on scientific self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997; Trujillo & Tanner, 2014) have reported that students' beliefs about their ability to succeed in science activities significantly affect their willingness to engage in science-related activities. In addition, Kupermintz (2002) observed that students' scientific inquiry self-efficacy was significantly correlated with their interest in science learning and academic performance in middle school, high school, and university. Accordingly, to understand the factors affecting student scientific inquiry self-efficacy after participating in the SICW, we proposed the following research hypothesis (H2): Significant correlations exist between gender, learning motivation, and scientific inquiry self-efficacy variables. In Taiwan, Hong et al. (2020) found that students' high learning motivation exerted a significant mediating effect on the relationships between learning interest and scientific inquiry self-efficacy. Furthermore, Hong and Lin (2013) indicated that the scientific self-efficacy scores of senior and vocational high school male students were significantly higher than those of female students, especially for male students with a high level of interest in scientific activities. This thus implies that gender would have a mediating effect on student scientific inquiry self-efficacy. Accordingly, we proposed the following hypothesis (H3): Learning motivations and gender have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between science participation and curiosity as a predictor of scientific inquiry ability and scientific performance.Methods The SICW was a 1-day workshop divided into two parts. The first part involved a Scientific Inquiry Ability Training course, and the second part involved a Scientific Inquiry Creative Practice course, consisting of science writing, science video production, and science comics drawing. The SICW was held in northern, central, and southern Taiwan, with a total of 480 senior and vocational high school students participating in it. All participating students completed a structured scientific inquiry self-efficacy questionnaire after the 1-day SICW. Regarding the data analysis process, this study first used multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the effects of region, gender, and learning motivation differences on student scientific inquiry self-efficacy. Subsequently, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling were used to explore the relationships between the variables related to student scientific inquiry self-efficacy.Results 1. Students with different backgrounds exhibited significant differences in scientific inquiry self-efficacy after participating in the SICW.(1) Students from southern Taiwan presented significantly higher scores on scientific inquiry self-efficacy than did those from central Taiwan. (2) Male students exhibited significantly higher scientific inquiry self-efficacy than did female students. (3) Actively engaged students had higher scientific inquiry self-efficacy than did their passively engaged counterparts. 2. The students' total scientific inquiry self-efficacy score had a significant and positive correlation with their inquiry ability and scientific performance.3. The students' scientific engagement, scientific interest, and curiosity scores had significant predictive power on their inquiry ability and scientific performance. 4. The student gender and learning motivation exerted a mediating effect on their scientific inquiry self-efficacy.Discussion and Suggestions According to the theory proposed by Clark and Mayer (2016), when meaningful learning images are used in the learning process, students' positive emotions toward learning and learning motivation are improved. The present study observed that combining the Scientific Inquiry Ability Training course with the Scientific Inquiry Creative Practice course in the SICW exerted a significant effect on secondary school students. The SICW also combined multiple strategies, such as cross-disciplinary scientific innovation themes, professional innovative teaching, and multimedia teaching, which could effectively improve learning motivation and scientific inquiry self-efficacy (Park et al., 2014).This study has two essential findings: First, students' scientific engagement and scientific interest and curiosity can significantly predict their inquiry ability and scientific performance. This study combined scientific inquiry theory with three different creative practice courses (science writing, science video production, and science comics drawing) to cultivate student scientific inquiry self-efficacy in a 1-day workshop (Falk & Dierking, 2010). The study findings demonstrate the educational value of the SICW and reveal the differences and relationships among participants' scientific inquiry self-efficacy variables. Second, this study verified the mediating effect of gender and learning motivation on students' inquiry ability and scientific performance. Accordingly, teachers should consider how to integrate the cross-domain STEAM curriculum design with effective teaching methods to eliminate gender differences and help those who have low learning motivation to improve their learning interest; this may influence their inquiry ability and scientific performance. In conclusion, the present study explored the effectiveness of an SICW in promoting senior and vocational high school students' scientific inquiry self-efficacy. The study findings are expected to stimulate further discussion on informal science education and provide more beneficial empirical evidence to strengthen the development of student scientific inquiry self-efficacy.",2022,,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES,67,4,177-219,WOS:000917354100007,10.6209/JORIES.202212_67(4).0006,,#707,Lu 2022,"",""
Promotion of Physical Activity Among University Students With Social Media Or Text Messaging: A Systematic Review,"Buja, A; Lo Bue, R; Mariotti, F; Miatton, A; Zampieri, C; Leone, G","Regular physical exercise lowers the risk of all-cause mortality and various chronic diseases. New technologies, such as smartphones and social media, have been used successfully as health promotion tools in college populations. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of interventions that used modern technologies, as with social media or text messaging, to promote physical activity or reducing sedentary behavior in college students. The systematic review was conducted on the PubMed and SCOPUS databases, considering studies published from 2012 to 2022. For a total of 19 articles selected, an evidence table was drawn up, and the quality of the studies was assessed using the PRISMA checklist. The interventions differed enormously in design, from the strategies implemented to the types of outcome considered. Fifteen of the 19 studies demonstrated an improvement in participants' physical activity levels, 3 studies found no such improvement, and 1 reported a worsening of baseline activity levels. Interventions to improve college students' physical activity levels through the use of social media and/or text messaging tend to be effective. However, many factors can influence the effectiveness of such interventions. For example, a gender-related difference emerged in student participation, and the interventions proved more effective if they were accompanied by the creation of social groups.",2024,,INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING,61,,,WOS:001222801400001,10.1177/00469580241248131,,#708,Buja 2024,"",""
"Trends in Tenure Status in Academic Family Medicine, 1977-2017: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and the Academic Mission","Xierali, IM; Nivet, MA; Syed, ZA; Shakil, A; Schneider, FD","PurposeTenure status has important implications for medical school faculty recruitment and retention and may affect educational quality, academic freedom, and collegiality. However, tenure trends in academic family medicine are unknown. This study aimed to describe trends in tenure status of family medicine faculty overall and by gender and status of minorities underrepresented in medicine (URM) in Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited medical schools.MethodAssociation of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster data were used to describe trends in tenure status of full-time family medicine faculty, 1977 to 2017. Bivariate and trend analyses were conducted to assess associations and describe patterns between tenure status and gender, race, and ethnicity. Interdepartmental variations in tenure trends over the years were also examined.ResultsAmong family medicine faculty, the proportions of faculty tenured or on a tenure track dropped more than threefold from 1977 (46.6%; n = 507/1,089) to 2017 (12.7%; n = 729/5,752). Lower proportions of women and URM faculty were tenured or on a tenure track than male and non-URM faculty, respectively. But the gaps among them were converging. Compared with other clinical departments, family medicine had the highest proportion of faculty (74.6%; n = 4,291/5,752) not on a tenure track in 2017.ConclusionsProportion of tenure positions significantly decreased among family medicine faculty in U.S. medical schools. While gaps between male and female faculty and among certain racial/ethnic groups remained for family medicine tenure status, they have decreased over time, mainly because of a substantial increase in nontenured positions.",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,2,241-247,WOS:000529216900023,10.1097/ACM.0000000000002890,,#709,Xierali 2020,"",""
The Association of the H-Index and Academic Rank Among Full-Time Academic Hand Surgeons Affiliated With Fellowship Programs,"Lopez, J; Susarla, SM; Swanson, EW; Calotta, N; Lifchez, SD","Purpose To evaluate the association between the Hirsch index (a measure of publications and citations) and academic rank among hand surgeons.Methods This was a cross-sectional study of full-time academic hand surgeons within Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education approved hand surgery fellowship programs in the United States and Canada. The study variables were classified as bibliometric (h-index, I-10 index, total number of publications, total number of citations, maximum number of citations for a single work) and demographics (gender, training factors). The outcome was academic rank (instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, professor, endowed professor). Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple regression statistics were computed.Results The sample was composed of 366 full-time academic hand surgeons; 86% were male and 98% had formal hand surgery fellowship training. The mean time since completion of surgical training was 17 + 11 years. The distribution of primary faculty appointments was orthopedic surgery (70%) and plastic surgery (30%). Two hundred fifty surgeons (68%) were members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. The mean h-index was 10.2 +/- 9.9 and was strongly correlated with academic rank. Gender was not associated with academic rank. Distribution of academic ranks was as follows: instructor (4%), assistant professor (28%), associate professor (40%), professor (22%), and endowed professor (5%). The h-index, years since completion of training, and American Society for Surgery of the Hand membership were associated with academic rank. The h-index had a high sensitivity and specificity for predicting academic rank.Conclusions The h-index is a reliable tool for quantitatively assessing research productivity and should be considered for use in academic hand surgery.Clinical relevance When evaluating candidates for academic promotion in hand surgery, the h-index is a potentially valuable tool for assessing research productivity and impact.

Building an Equitable Surgical Training Pipeline: Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES),"Santos-Parker, JR; Santos-Parker, KS; Caceres, J; Vargas, GM; Kwakye, G; Englesbe, MJ; Valbuena, VSM","OBJECTIVE: Underrepresented minority (URM) medical students face many educational challenges. Barriers include lack of equitable representation, scarce mentorship, and the effects of systemic racism. For students interested in diversity and health equity, perceptions of surgical culture may discourage pursuing surgical specialties. We describe a national pilot for a novel surgical pipeline program, Leadership Exposure for the Advancement of Gender and Underrepresented Minority Equity in Surgery (LEAGUES), which utilizes early exposure, mentorship, and community building to empower URM students in pursuit of academic surgical careers.DESIGN: A 4-week virtual program included pairing students with faculty research mentors, virtual skills sessions, and seminars on leadership, advocacy, and career development. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews before and after participation, assessing experiences with mentorship and research, interest in surgery, career aspirations, and perceived barriers to career goals.SETTING: Department of Surgery, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan.PARTICIPANTS: Rising second-year medical students.RESULTS: All 3 participants were Latinx; 2 were first-generation college students. Participants had no surgical mentorship and limited research exposure, citing a desire to learn research methodology, connect with mentors, and build towards a career working with underserved communities as motivating factors for participation. Perceived barriers to a surgical career included surgical culture, burnout, and lack of research expertise or academic network necessary for success. At completion of the program, participants described several themes: (1) new positive perspective on academic surgical culture, (2) interest and confidence in research, (3) hope for improving health disparities, (4) networking and longitudinal mentorship connections contributing to a sense of surgical community, and (5) eagerness to share resources with colleagues at their home institutions.CONCLUSIONS: LEAGUES program participants acquired tools and motivation to pursue careers in surgery, and established valuable longitudinal network and mentor relationships.

Impact of a formal mentoring program on academic promotion of Department of Medicine faculty: A comparative study,"Univ Toronto; Morrison, LJ; Lorens, E; Bandiera, G; Liles, WC; Lee, L; Hyland, R; McDonald-Blumer, H; Allard, JP; Panisko, DM; Heathcote, EJ; Levinson, W","Purpose: To evaluate the impact of a formal mentoring program on time to academic promotion and differences in gender-based outcomes.Methods: Comparisons of time to promotion (i) before and after implementation of a formal mentoring program and (ii) between mentored and non-mentored faculty matched for covariates. Using paired-samples t-testing and mixed repeated measures ANCOVA, we explored the effect of mentor assignment and influence of gender on time to promotion.Results: Promotional data from 1988 to 2010 for 382 faculty members appointed before 2003 were compared with 229 faculty members appointed in 2003 or later. Faculty appointed in 2003 or later were promoted 1.2 years (mean) sooner versus those appointed before 2003 (3.7 [SD=1.7] vs. 2.5 [SD=2], p<0.0001). Regardless of year of appointment, mentor assignment appears to be significantly associated with a reduction in time to promotion versus non-mentored (3.4 [SD=2.4] vs. 4.4 [SD=2.6], p=0.011). Gender effects were statistically insignificant. Post hoc analyses of time to promotion suggested that observed differences are not attributable to temporal effects, but rather assignment to a mentor.Conclusions: Mentoring was a powerful predictor of promotion, regardless of the year of appointment and likely benefited both genders equally.

Publication Productivity and Experience: Factors Associated with Academic Rank Among Orthopaedic Surgery Faculty in the United States,"Ence, AK; Cope, SR; Holliday, EB; Somerson, JS","Background: Many factors play a role in academic promotion among orthopaedic surgeons. This study specifically examined the importance of publication productivity metrics, career duration, and sex on academic rank in orthopaedic surgery programs in the United States.Methods: Faculty at 142 civilian academic orthopaedic surgery departments in 2014 were identified. Geographic region, department size, and 3 specific faculty characteristics (sex, career duration, and academic position) were recorded. The Hirsch index (h-index), defined as the number (h) of an investigator's publications that have been cited at least h times, was recorded for each surgeon. The m-index was also calculated by dividing the h-index by career duration in years. Thresholds for the h-index and the m-index were identified between junior and senior academic ranks. Multivariate analysis was used to determine whether the 3 physician factors correlated independently with academic rank.Results: The analysis included 4,663 orthopaedic surgeons at 142 academic institutions (24.7% clinical faculty and 75.3% academic faculty). Among academic faculty, the median h-index was 5, the median career duration was 15 years, and the median m-index was 0.37. Thresholds between junior and senior faculty status were 12 for the h-index and 0.51 for the m-index. Female academic faculty had a lower median h-index (3 compared with 5; p < 0.001) and career duration (10 years compared with 16 years; p < 0.001) than male academic faculty, but had a similar median m-index (0.33 compared with 0.38; p = 0.103). A higher h-index and longer career duration correlated independently with an increased probability of senior academic rank (p < 0.001), but sex did not (p = 0.217).Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that a higher h-index and m-index correlate with a higher academic orthopaedic faculty rank. Although female surgeons had a lower median h-index and a shorter median career duration than male surgeons, theirm-index was not significantly different, and thus sex was not an independent predictor for senior academic rank.

Determinants of health-promoting lifestyles amongst Indian University students,"Gore, MN; Menon, KC; Safai, AA; Shukla, S; Yeravdekar, R","The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in young Indians underscores a compelling need to instil healthy lifestyles in adolescents and young adults. The present study aimed to assess the health-promoting lifestyles of freshmen admitted to institutes under seven different faculties of an international university in India. The study was conducted across ?ve Indian cities and recruited 4253 participants pursuing both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Information on socio-demographic factors and health-promoting lifestyle behaviours using a modi?ed Health-Promoting Lifestyle Pro?le (HPLP) scale was collected.

This was a cross-sectional study of full-time academic oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the United States. The predictor variables were categorized as demographic (gender, medical degree, research doctorate, other advanced degree) and quantitative measures of academic productivity (total number of publications, total number of citations, maximum number of citations for a single article, I-10 index [number of publications with >= 10 citations], and h-index [number of publications h with >= h citations each]). The outcome variable was current academic rank (instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, professor, or endowed professor). Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple regression statistics were computed to evaluate associations between the predictors and academic rank. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were computed to identify thresholds for academic promotion. The sample consisted of 324 academic oral and maxillofacial surgeons, of whom 11.7% were female, 40% had medical degrees, and 8% had research doctorates. The h-index was the most strongly correlated with academic rank (rho=0.62, p<0.001). H-indexes of >= 4, >= 8, and >= 13 were identified as thresholds for promotion to associate professor, professor, and endowed professor, respectively (p<0.001).

An index to characterize female career promotion in academic medicine,"Brüggmann, D; Groneberg, DA","Background: Imbalances in female career promotion are a key factor of gender disparities at the workplace. They may lead to stress and stress-related diseases including burnout, depression or cardiovascular diseases. Since this problem cannot be generalized and varies between different fields, new approaches are needed to assess and describe the magnitude of the problem in single fields of work.Methods: To construct a new index, operating figures of female and male medical students were collected for Germany in a period over 15 years and their progression throughout their studies towards specialization and academic chair positions. By the use of different female to male ratios (f:m), we constructed an index that describes the extend by which women can ascent in their academic career by using the field of academic medicine as an example.Results: A medical student f: m ratio of 1.54 (52,366 female vs. 34,010 male) was found for Germany in 2013. In 1998, this f: m ratio was 0.999. In the same year (2013), the OB/GYN hospital specialists' f: m ratio was 1.566 (3347 female vs. 2137 male physicians) and 0.577 (516 female vs 894 male physicians) for ENT hospital specialists, respectively. The f: m ratios concerning chairs of OB/GYN and ENT were 0.105 and 0.1, respectively. Then an index was generated that incorporated these operating figures with the student f: m ratio as denominator and the chair f: m ratio as numerator while the hospital specialist f: m ratio served as a corrector in the numerator in order to adjust to the attraction of a given field to female physicians. As a result, the index was 0.044 for OB/GYN and 0.113 for ENT instead of ideally similar to 1 in a completely gender harmonized situation.Conclusion: In summary, a new index to describe female career advancement was established for academic medicine. By the use of this index, different academic and medical fields can now be compared to each other and future benchmarks could be proposed. Also, country differences may be examined using the proposed index and the success of specific funding programs.",2017,,JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY,12,,1-7,WOS:000406546600001,10.1186/s12995-017-0164-7,,#719,Brüggmann 2017,"",""
Gender diversity in pediatric surgery: academic ranks and scholarly productivity amongst pediatric surgeons,"Mullis, DM; Mueller, C; Bonham, SA; Hunt, E; Uribe, D; Miller, H; Bianco, YK","Purpose: Despite a growing number of women entering medical school, a small proportion of women pursue surgical specialties, including pediatric surgery. This multi-center study assesses gender-based differences in measures of scholarly productivity and distribution of faculty positions. Methods: This is a retrospective web-based study of all pediatric surgeons at twelve large institutions across the United States. Data published by the American Association of Medical Colleges was compiled and analyzed to understand the gender distributions of medical students, general surgery residents, and pediatric surgery fellows. P-values were calculated using two-sided Student's independent t-tests and chi-squared tests. Results: There have been a growing number of women applying into pediatric surgery, but the proportion of women matriculating into these fellowships is not concordant. Women are still underrepresented (28%) amongst the pediatric surgeon workforce. A total of 111 pediatric surgeons were identified for this study, which included 31 women (28%) and 80 males (72%). There was a significant difference in the distribution across academic ranks between genders (p < 0.001).

Promoting Game Jams and Hackathons as more Women-inclusive Environments for Informal Learning,"IEEE; Paganini, L; Ferraz, C; Gama, K; Alves, C","Hackathons and game jams are informal venues to engage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students in practical learning and nurturing interdisciplinary competencies (e.g., programming, design, communication). They also offer rich opportunities for networking and boosting the employability of participants. However, due to the not very inclusive culture created around them, these events may become hostile places for women. The low participation of women in hackathons and game jams may result in a loss of opportunity for them to improve their skills or to find jobs. Little is known about the motivations and perceptions of women participating in hackathons and game jams. We aimed at understanding (1) what are the typical gender-related problems women face in hackathons and game jams and how the perspective of men differ in regards to that problem; (2) how women perceive their motivations and their experience when participating in such events; and (3) what deters some women from participating. In this paper, we surveyed 211 participants of 8 events of this nature targeting higher education students with multidisciplinary backgrounds: 2 game jams (one of them women-focused) and 6 hackathons (one of them women-focused). Additionally, we applied a survey to hear the voice of 47 women who never attended these events to understand their lack of motivation. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we compared the perspectives of men and women who participated in the studied hackathons and game jams. The qualitative data allowed us to investigate different experiences of women who reported discomfort in these events. As contributions of this paper, based on the collected data, we report different perspectives that men and women have about gender issues in these events and highlight the typical sexist behavior (bropriating, mansplaining, etc) of men participating in hackathons and game jams. Results showed that learning is the main motivation for both men and women to join these events. We also map the common reasons for women not being motivated to participate in these types of gatherings. Finally, we propose recommendations so that hackathons and game jams can increase gender equality. Our experience suggests these events, if well planned and executed, may become drivers to change attitudes and stereotypes regarding women in computing. By lowering those barriers, women can be more engaged and stimulated so they can also take advantage of more opportunities for STEAM learning in such informal settings.",2021,,2021 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2021),,,,WOS:000821947700190,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637301,,#723,IEEE 2021,"",""
Faculty Experiences Related to Career Advancement and Success in Academic Medicine,"Han, H; Korte, R; Prakash, V; Hingle, ST","Phenomenon: Faculty career success in academic medicine is complex. Dynamic interactions among faculty and between faculty and their socio-cultural working environments contribute to the mystique of academic advancement. There are few empirical studies that analyze the social practice of faculty career advancement in academic medicine, especially those that focus on relations between individual and environmental contexts. This study aimed to investigate various faculty members' experiences around career advancement in a medical school. Through the analytical lens of Bourdieu's theory of practice, we focused on the relationship among individuals, positions, and environmental contexts. Approach: Following a general process of interpretive grounded theory, we collected faculty members' perceptions and experiences related to their career development and advancement via in-depth semi structured-interviews of 23 faculty at a medical school in the United States. We analyzed the interview transcripts using thematic and constant-comparison analyses, informed by Bourdieu's theory of practice emphasizing the concepts of habitus, field, doxa, illusio, and capital. Findings: While there was a general perception of collaborative success in the school, access to resources seemed to be unequally distributed and linked to faculty positions. Career opportunities, such as leadership and promotion, were mostly granted by leaders based on interpersonal relationships (social capital). Clinical faculty's limited access to professional development activities (cultural capital), including research, limited their likelihood for promotion (symbolic capital) at the school. An institutional emphasis on clinical productivity reinforced clinical faculty's constraints on academic scholarship, which led to perceived inequities by clinical faculty. Participants also perceived subtle gender bias and an unequal distribution of power among the specialties, which contradicted a culture of collaboration and support in the school. Insights: Complex power structures influence faculty career success. Unequal access and differential power among faculty positions resulted in disparities in career advancement. Greater transparency, equity, and inclusivity are obvious suggestions for change to allow all faculty to benefit from essential resources and career building opportunities. Furthermore, building high-quality relationships between leaders and faculty and mutual respect between specialties are essential to sustaining an organizational culture conducive to career success for all faculty. Faculty will benefit from a greater awareness of the structural and normative aspects of a medical school that are less obvious and more difficult to change. This is the value of applying Bourdieu's theory of practice to the socio-cultural dynamics of the medical school.",2023,,TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE,35,5,514-526,WOS:000850864900001,10.1080/10401334.2022.2104851,,#724,Han 2023,"",""

Field notes as well as communications between the study team and community partners were used to design the recruitment strategy and its implementation with a goal of enrolling 50 participants. At its core, the recruitment strategy included community kickoff events to detail the state-of-the-art nature of the mHealth intervention components, the utility of CV health assessments (physical examination, laboratory studies and surveys) and the participants' role in advancing our understanding of the efficacy of mHealth interventions among racial/ethnic minority groups. Detailed recruitment data were documented throughout the study. A self-administered, electronic survey measured sociodemographics, technology use and EHL (eHEALS scale).Results: A total of 50 participants (70% women) from five AA churches were recruited over a one-month period. The majority (>90%) of participants reported using some form of mobile technology with all utilizing these technologies within their homes. Greater than half (60% [30/50]) reported being ""very comfortable"" with mobile technologies. Overall, participants had high EHL (84.8% [39/46] with eHEALS score >= 26) with no differences by sex.Conclusions: This study illustrates the feasibility and success of a CBPR approach in recruiting AAs into mHealth intervention research and contributes to the growing body of evidence that AAs have high EHL, are high-users of mobile technologies, and thus are likely to be receptive to mHealth interventions.",2018,,JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,7,1,,WOS:000432915700020,10.2196/resprot.8842,,#725,Brewer 2018,"",""
The Impacts of Pilates and Yoga on Health-Promoting Behaviors and Subjective Health Status,"Lim, EJ; Hyun, EJ","This study investigates whether Pilates and yoga lead people to adopt generally health-promoting lifestyle elements and feel better about their physical and mental fitness. To this end, we designed an 8 week exercise program of Pilates and yoga reviewed by veteran practitioners and conducted an experimental study through which we collected the data from 90 volunteered adult subjects between ages 30 and 49 (mean age = 35.47), equally represented by women and men without previous experience with Pilates or yoga. In the 8 week long experiment, we assigned the subjects to three groups, where subjects in the two exercise groups regularly took part in either Pilates or yoga classes, and the control group participated in neither exercise classes. All participants completed two surveys, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP II) and the Health Self-Rating Scale (HSRS), before and after their assigned program. In our analysis of pre- and post-treatment differences across the three groups, we ran ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Sheffe test, implemented using SPSS PASW Statistics 18.00. Our results indicate that Pilates and yoga groups exhibited a higher engagement in health-promoting behaviors than the control group after the program. Subjective health status, measured with HSRS, also improved significantly among Pilates and yoga participants compared to those in the control group after the program. The supplementary analysis finds no significant gender-based difference in these impacts. Overall, our results confirm that Pilates and yoga help recruit health-promoting behaviors in participants and engender positive beliefs about their subjective health status, thereby setting a positive reinforcement cycle in motion. By providing clear evidence that the promotion of Pilates or yoga can serve as an effective intervention strategy that helps individuals change behaviors adverse to their health, this study offers practical implications for healthcare professionals and public health officials alike.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18,7,,WOS:000638528900001,10.3390/ijerph18073802,,#726,Lim 2021,"",""
"The association of gender, experience, and academic rank in peer-reviewed manuscript evaluation","Garcia, JA; Montero-Parodi, JJ; Rodriguez-Sanchez, R; Fdez-Valdivia, J","Background: We consider a research model for manuscript evaluation using a two-stage process. In the first stage, the current submission reminds reviewers of previous reviewing experiences, and then, reviewers aggregate these past review experiences into a kind of norm for assessing the scientific contribution and clarity of writing required for a manuscript. In the second stage, the reviewer's norms are imposed on the manuscript under review, and the reviewer's attention is drawn to discrepancies between the norm retrieved from previous similar peer review experiences and the reality for this submission.Methods: Five research hypotheses were integrated into this research model. In our study, we tested these five research hypotheses for statistical differences among reviewers by gender, experience, and academic rank using an online survey. There were 573 respondents.Results: We did not find significant differences among reviewers in their basic behavioral patterns. The only exception was that the low-rank reviewers agreed with the first hypothesis ""H1: Selective norm"" to a greater extent than the high-rank reviewers.Conclusions: The interaction between a reviewer's past review experiences and the actual scientific contribution and writing clarity of the manuscript under review can explain the lack of consistency among different reviews for the same manuscript.",2024,,ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-ETHICS INTEGRITY AND POLICY,,,,WOS:001377706300001,10.1080/08989621.2024.2440098,,#727,Garcia 2024,"",""
Assessment of Differences in Academic Rank and Compensation by Gender and Race/Ethnicity Among Academic Radiation Oncologists in the United States,"Raldow, AC; Siker, ML; Bonner, JA; Chen, Y; Liu, FF; Metz, JM; Movsas, B; Potters, L; Schultz, CJ; Wilson, E; Wang, XY; Romero, T; Steinberg, ML; Jagsi, R","Purpose: Advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion in the physician workforce is essential to providing high-quality and culturally responsive patient care and has been shown to improve patient outcomes. To better characterize equity in the field of radiation oncology, we sought to describe the current academic radiation oncology workforce, including any contemporary differences in compensation and rank by gender and race/ethnicity.Methods and Materials: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) 2018 Financial Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with associate or full professor rank. Compensation was compared by gender and race/ethnicity overall and stratified by rank and was further analyzed using multivariable linear regression models.Results: Of the 858 academic radiation oncologists from 63 departments in the United States in the sample, 33.2% were female, 65.2% were White, 27.2% were Asian, and 7.6% were underrepresented in medicine (URiM). There were 44.0% assistant professors, 32.0% associate professors, and 22.8% full professors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for factors associated with associate or full professor rank did not reveal statistically significant associations between gender or race/ethnicity with academic rank (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.32; P = .48 for gender; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.5-1.30; P = .37 for Asian vs White; and OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.31-1.55; P = .37 for URiM vs White), but CIs were wide due to sample size, and point estimates were <1. Similarly, multivariable linear regression analysis modeling the log relative total compensation did not detect statistically significant differences between radiation oncologists by gender (-1.7%; 95% CI, -6.8% to 3.4%; P = .51 for female vs male) or race/ethnicity (-1.6%; 95% CI, -7.3% to 4.0%; P = .57 for Asian vs White and -3.0%; 95% CI, -12.1% to 6.0%; P = .51 for URiM vs White).Conclusions: The low numbers of women and faculty with URiM race/ethnicity in this radiation oncology faculty sample limits the ability to compare career trajectory and compensation by those characteristics. Given that point estimates were <1, our findings do not contradict larger multispecialty studies that suggest an ongoing need to monitor equity. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Asset map in a Chilean Health Promoting University: 'a strategy for revitalization',"Pérez-Wilson, P; Marcos-Marcos, J; Carrasco-Portiño, M; Ruiz-Cantero, MT; Alvarez-Dardet, C","Health Promoting Universities (HPUs) are more likely to perform actions intended to change habits and increase personal empowerment, than they are to develop community actions. The objective of this research is to create an asset map to visualize collective actions in a Chilean HPU. A qualitative study, based on the ABCD model was conducted. There were 149 people, distributed into 48 semi-structured interviews and 14 focus groups, who participated in this study (students, employees, ex-students and retirees). An asset map was elaborated, identifying the contributions of residents, associations and organizations, local institutions, physical resources, economic assets and local culture and with a new category, 'connecting assets'. These categories show the range of resources in a university. According to the participants, the questions on asset identification were a tool for reflection, and by giving their opinions and discovering or drawing attention to new resources, they gained a better understanding of the assets in the university. Several participants stated that these talks could generate a positive emotional environment, which boosted their wellbeing. There were gender- and group-based differences in how the assets were valued. Students stressed assets related to services and benefits from the institution, green areas, and collective spaces. Employees, retirees and ex-students emphasized assets related to belonging, identity and traditions. Men appreciated openness and privacy in physical spaces. Women highlighted assets related to the institution. The resulting map, displays a range of resources that can help the university develop new possibilities for comprehensive and collective actions that would revitalize the HPU strategy.",2022,,HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL,37,1,,WOS:000755854400001,10.1093/heapro/daab038,,#729,Pérez-Wilson 2022,"",""
Wisibilizalas: Promoting the Role of Women in ICT Among Secondary School Students,"Freire, A; Ruiz-Garcia, A; Oliver, VM","Although technology comprises an important part of our daily life, no matter your gender, women are underrepresented in the overall sector of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). Among several reasons, the recurring stereotype that male students are more suitable for technical studies is the one that stands out. In this context, and with the aim of breaking this stereotype, we introduce Wisibilizalas, a contest addressed to high-school students to show inspirational women to young students, giving global visibility of female ICT professionals and making the students being in touch with technology. Participants have to create a website containing profiles of female ICT professionals. As a requirement, the chosen profiles must correspond to Spanish women who are currently developing their professional career. This way, we promote the active contribution that female engineers have in our current economy and society. OS students in 15 different teams across Spain took part, creating 50 highly-diverse profiles of women in academia, industry or entrepreneurs, and with different levels of seniority. The contest achieved external impact in media and international recognition. Through some questionnaires, we could evaluate the positive impact of the contest in both students and teachers. The sample is equitable in terms of gender, what makes both girls and boys (and female and male teachers) talk about women working in the ICT domain.

Evaluation of Faculty Parental Leave Policies at Medical Schools Ranked by <i>US News & World Report</i> in 2020,"Slostad, J; Jain, S; McKinnon, M; Chokkara, S; Laiteerapong, N","IMPORTANCE Physician parents, particularly women, are more likely to experience burnout, poor family-career balance, adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, and stigmatization compared with nonparent colleagues. Because many physicians delay child-rearing due to the rigorous demands of medical training, favorable parental leave policies for faculty physicians are crucial to prevent physician workforce attrition.OBJECTIVE To evaluate paid and unpaid parental leave policies at medical schools ranked by US News & World Report in 2020 and identify factors associated with leave policies.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional national study was performed at US medical schools reviewed from December 1, 2019, through May 31, 2020, and February 1 through March 31, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All medical schools ranked by US News & World Report in 2020 were included.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of weeks of paid and unpaid leave for birth, nonbirth, adoption, and foster care physician parents. Institutional policies for the number of weeks of leave and requirements to use vacation, sick, or disability leave were characterized. Institutional factors were evaluated for association with the duration of paid parental leave using.2 tests.RESULTS Among the 90 ranked medical schools, 87 had available data. Sixty-three medical schools (72.4%) had some paid leave for birth mothers, but only 13 (14.9%) offered 12 weeks of fully paid leave. While 11 medical schools (12.6%) offered 12 weeks of full paid leave for nonbirth parents, 38 (43.7%) had no paid leave for nonbirth parents. Adoptive and foster parents had no paid leave in 35 (40.2%) and 65 (74.7%) medical schools, respectively. Median paid parental leave was 4 (IQR, 0-8) weeks for birth parents, 4 (IQR, 0-6) weeks for adoptive parents, 3 (IQR, 0-6) weeks for nonbirth parents, and 0 (IQR, 0-1) weeks for foster parents. About one-third of medical schools required birth mothers to use vacation (29 [33.3%]), sick leave (31 [35.6%]), or short-term disability (9 [10.3%]). Among institutional characteristics, higher ranking (top vs bottom quartile: 30.4% vs 4.0%; P =.03) and private designation (private vs public, 23.5% vs 9.4%; P <.001) was associated with a higher rate of 12 weeks of paid leave for birth mothers.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional national study of medical schools ranked by US News & World Report in 2020, many physician faculty receive no or very limited paid parental leave. The lack of paid parental leave was associated with higher rates of physician burnout and work-life integration dissatisfaction and may further perpetuate sex, racial and ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in academic medicine.",2023,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,6,1,,WOS:001059403300002,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.50954,,#731,Slostad 2023,"",""

Rank Equity Index: Measuring Parity in the Advancement of Underrepresented Populations in Academic Medicine,"Fassiotto, M; Flores, B; Victor, R; Altamirano, J; Garcia, LC; Kotadia, S; Maldonado, Y","As educators, researchers, clinicians, and administrators, faculty serve pivotal roles in academic medical centers (AMCs). Thus, the quality of faculty members' experiences is inseparable from an AMC's success. In seeking new methods to assess equity in advancement in academic medicine, the authors developed the Rank Equity Index (REI)-adapted from the Executive Parity Index, a scale previously implemented within the business sector-to examine national data on gender and racial/ethnic equity across faculty ranks. The REI was employed on self-reported demographic data, collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges, from U.S. medical school faculty in 2017, to make pairwise rank comparisons of the professoriate by demographic characteristics and department. Overall results indicated that women did not attain parity at any pairwise rank comparison, while men were above parity at all ranks. Similar results were observed across all departments surveyed: women in the basic sciences had REIs closest to parity, women in pediatrics had the highest representation but had REIs that were further from parity than REIs in the basic sciences, and women in surgery demonstrated the lowest REIs. Nationally, REIs were below 1.00 for all racial/ethnic group rank comparisons except for White and, in one case, multiple-race non-Hispanic/Latinx. Across all analyzed departments, Black/African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and multiple-race Hispanic/Latinx faculty had REIs below parity at all ranks except in 2 cases. In a comparison of 2017 and 2007 data, REIs across both race/ethnicity and gender were lower in 2007 for nearly all groups. REI analyses can highlight inequities in faculty rank that may be masked when using aggregate faculty proportions, which do not account for rank. The REI provides AMCs with a new tool to better analyze institutional data to inform efforts to increase parity across all faculty ranks.",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,12,1844-1852,WOS:000592283100028,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003720,,#733,Fassiotto 2020,"",""
Limitations in Faculty Advancement for Underrepresented Groups in Academic Otolaryngology,"Kim, SG; Russel, SM; Stack, TJ; Frank-Ito, DO; Farzal, Z; Ebert, CS ; Buckmire, RA; Demason, CE; Shah, RN","Objective: Despite the increasing racial diversity of the United States, representation in academic medicine faculty does not reach concordance with the general population and worsens with higher rank. Few studies have examined this within academic Otolaryngology and surgical subspecialties. This project aims to compare rank equity in academic Otolaryngology on self-reported gender and race/ethnicity between the years 2000 and 2020.Methods: Publicly available data were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges under the ""Data & Reports"" section for the years 2000 and 2020. The report comprised of full-time faculty from all U.S. medical schools. To determine parity between faculty ranks across gender and race/ethnicity, rank equity index (REI) was calculated for associate/assistant, professor/associate, and professor/assistant professor comparisons.Results: The percentage of women faculty in Otolaryngology has increased from 21% in 2000 to 37% in 2020; however, they did not achieve parity at all rank comparisons for both years. On the contrary, men were above parity at all rank comparisons. Improvements in rank equity occurred for Black/African American (Black) and Hispanic Latino/Spanish Origin (Latine) faculty between the years 2000 and 2020; however, when accounting for gender, benefits were concentrated among men.Conclusion: Advancement along the academic ladder is limited for women of all racial groups in academic Otolaryngology.

Inclusivity in Leader Selection: An 8-Step Process to Promote Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Leadership,"Holladay, CL; Cavanaugh, KJ; Perkins, LD; Woods, AL","At a systemic level, organizations need to take intentional steps to build inclusion, equity, and diversity at all levels. In accordance with this need, organizations have been catalyzed by national conversations surrounding gender and racial/ethnic discrimination to generate sustainable change that addresses the disenfranchisement of women and racial/ethnic minorities. Although progress toward addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate these inequities has been made in recent years, research indicates that underrepresentation at the leadership level persists in academic medicine. Further, those in more senior roles are more likely to select, sponsor, and/or mentor individuals like themselves, thereby depriving minority populations of experiences directly correlated with career development and advancement. Hence, the authors posit a focus on the characteristics and competencies of a leader along with a structured selection process is an effective intervention to reduce bias and support inclusion by recalibrating the representation of leadership within academic medical centers. To this end, the authors developed a sequential 8-step leader selection process informed by their model of leadership characteristics and competencies. This process includes a policy update, selection of interview panels, training of panelists, screening the candidate pool, structured interview guides, final candidate slates, assessments of final candidates, and development of newly selected leaders. By following this process, the authors' organization has seen an increase in the representation of women and racial/ethnic minority leaders, an increase in employees' favorable perceptions specific to representation, and data indicative of developing and maintaining an internal diverse leadership candidate pipeline. Ultimately, inclusion makes stronger and more resilient organizations. By following a standardized process grounded in leadership characteristics and competencies, academic medical centers can see changes in their leadership that mirror the populations they lead and serve. Using such processes can lead to the kind of systemic change needed to create inclusive environments.",2023,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,98,1,36-42,WOS:000905161600014,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004956,,#736,Holladay 2023,"",""

Individuals with doctorate degrees who applied for either rank were included in the study. Data collected included demographic characteristics, curriculum vitae at time of application, committee score sheets, and deferral and approval decisions. Deferral rates for women compared with men and for URMs compared with non-URMs was the primary outcome. Results: Of 462 people who applied for associate professor, 10% (n=46) were deferred. Those promoted had worked longer at Mayo Clinic (median, 6 years vs 2 years; P=.01), had more mentees vs 30 [24-35]; P<.001), and were more likely to be on a National Institutes of Health or institutional grant (P<.05).

Applicants were asked to rate the importance of various factors as they related to constructing their residency rank list.Main Outcome Measurements: Means and standard deviations were calculated for items included in the survey.Results: A response rate of 26% was obtained, with the responses of 98 applicants (20%) ultimately analyzed. The highest rated factors included ""perceived happiness of current residents,"" ""opportunities for hands-on procedure training,"" ""perceived camaraderie among current residents,"" ""perceived camaraderie among faculty and current residents,"" ""perceived quality of current residents,"" and ""perceived work/life balance among current residents."" Although male and female respondents demonstrated similar ranking preferences, an apparent difference was detected between how genders rated the importance of ""whether the program projects a favorable environment for women"" and ""whether the program projects a favorable environment for minorities."" As compared with previous PM&R applicants, current prospective trainees seem to place greater importance on skill acquisition over didactic teaching.Conclusion: Prospective PM&R residents highly value subjective perceptions of prospective PM&R training programs and the ability to obtain hands-on procedural experience.",2018,,PM&R,10,3,286-292,WOS:000427816500008,10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.08.445,,#738,Auriemma 2018,"",""
Protocol for a systematic review of economic evaluations conducted on gender-transformative interventions aimed at preventing unintended pregnancy and promoting sexual health in adolescents,"Ncube, J; Adom, T; Nkonki, L","Introduction In the context of family planning and reproductive health, a gender-transformative approach involves helping communities understand and challenge the social norms that perpetuate inequalities between men and women, and improving women's access to key services. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesise the best available evidence on economic evaluations of gender transformative interventions targeted at preventing unintended pregnancy and promoting sexual health in adolescents, assess the methodological quality of the economic evaluation studies and identify gaps in the evidence. Methods and analysis We will search the following bibliographic databases for economic evaluations that meet our selection criteria; PubMed, Cochrane, National Health Service EE database, SCOPUS, CINHAL, Web of Science and Paediatric EE Database. We will additionally conduct a grey literature search. The search will be conducted for the period 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2021. Two independent reviewers will conduct the screening, data extraction and quality assessment. We will consider the following outcomes from economic evaluations; relative resource use, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, incremental net benefit ratio or net present value, quality-adjusted life-years and disability-adjusted life-years. Quality assessment will be conducted using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement and the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist. Results will be reported using summary tables and narratively. Attempts will be made to use the Joanna Briggs Institute three-by-three dominance ranking matrix tool to compare relevant cost-effectiveness studies. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required because the review will not use individual patient data, instead publicly available economic evaluation research studies will be used. However, an ethics exemption was obtained from the Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee, Reference No: X21/05/012. The results of the systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a relevant scientific conference.

"The impact of a faculty development program, the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP), on self-efficacy, academic promotion and institutional retention","Tung, J; Nahid, M; Rajan, M; Logio, L","Background Academic medical centers invest considerably in faculty development efforts to support the career success and promotion of their faculty, and to minimize faculty attrition. This study evaluated the impact of a faculty development program called the Leadership in Academic Medicine Program (LAMP) on participants' (1) self-ratings of efficacy, (2) promotion in academic rank, and (3) institutional retention. Method Participants from the 2013-2020 LAMP cohorts were surveyed pre and post program to assess their level of agreement with statements that spanned domains of self-awareness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with work and work environment. Pre and post responses were compared using McNemar's tests. Changes in scores across gender were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Mann-Whitney tests. LAMP participants were matched to nonparticipant controls by gender, rank, department, and time of hire to compare promotions in academic rank and departures from the organization. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine differences. Results There were significant improvements in almost all self-ratings on program surveys (p < 0.05). Greatest improvements were seen in ""understand the promotions process"" (36% vs. 94%), ""comfortable negotiating"" (35% vs. 74%), and ""time management"" (55% vs. 92%). There were no statistically significant differences in improvements by gender, however women faculty rated themselves lower on all pre-program items compared to men. There was significant difference found in time-to-next promotion (p = 0.003) between LAMP participants and controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that LAMP faculty achieved next promotion more often and faster than controls. Cox-proportional-hazards analyses found that LAMP faculty were 61% more likely to be promoted than controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.23, p-value = 0.004). There was significant difference found in time-to-departure (p < 0.0001) with LAMP faculty retained more often and for longer periods. LAMP faculty were 77% less likely to leave compared to controls (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16-0.34, p < 0.0001).

The role of glass ceiling in women's promotion to managerial positions from the perspective of faculty members at Iran University of Medical Sciences,"Ramezani, G; Pourbairamian, G; Goharinezhad, S; Norouzi, A; Keshavarzi, MH; Sohrabi, Z","BACKGROUND: In recent years, many changes have been observed in women's roles in organizations. In Iran, women face challenges to be promoted to high-level organizational positions. The present study aimed to examine the role of glass ceiling in promoting women to managerial positions from the perspective of the faculty members at Iran University of Medical Sciences.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was an applied study in terms of objectives and a descriptive-survey study in terms of data collection, variable monitoring and control, and generalizability. The statistical population of the study encompassed all clinical and basic sciences faculty members at Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2019-2020. The simple random sampling method was adopted, and the study instrument was the standard questionnaire of women's beliefs about glass ceiling developed by Smith (2012). To analyze the data, descriptive and inferential (namely paired-sample t-test and one-sample t-test) statistics were run in the SPSS software.RESULTS: The results revealed that glass ceiling dimensions could predict 48% of the variance of women's promotion to managerial positions. Furthermore, a significant difference was noticed between men and women's perspectives toward glass ceiling (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups of clinical and basic sciences (P > 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Failure to provide appropriate opportunities for qualified women to be promoted to managerial positions would result in nonexploitation of about half of the available capacities and talents.

Personal Statements in General Surgery: An Unrecognized Role in the Ranking Process,"Naples, R; French, JC; Lipman, JM; Prabhu, AS; Aiello, A; Park, SK","OBJECTIVE: Personal statements are a requirement of general surgery residency applications. Yet, their role in an applicant's final rank within a program remains unclear. This study explores the language used in personal statements to differentiate applicants in the general surgery residency ranking process.DESIGN: A textual analysis of general surgery residency applicant personal statements was performed. Using inductive coding and grounded theory, 3 main themes from personal statements were identified: my story, my future, my goals. These themes were utilized to build a dictionary consisting of over 400 descriptive terms in multiple categories. Data was extracted using the Linguistics Inquiry and Word Count program, which can linguistically determine basic characteristics from text. The data was stratified according to final rank and gender for analysis, using correlation and descriptive statistics.SETTING: Large, urban, academic general surgery residency program. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred nineteen personal statements during the 2018 to 2019 application cycle were analyzed. All applicants were interviewed and considered for inclusion on our final rank list. RESULTS: There were 68 (57%) females on the final rank list with no difference in the distribution of gender between those in the top and bottom halves (p = 0.11). Overall, personal statements for the top applicants scored higher in grit than those in the bottom half median 0.42% vs 0.35%, p = 0.03). Males ranked in the top half had less use of agentic (p = 0.04) and efficient/ organized (p = 0.03) words when compared with males ranked in the bottom half. In contrast, females ranked in the top half used more grit words compared to those in the bottom half (median 0.45% vs 0.35%, p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Linguistic differences existed in the personal statements of top- and bottom-ranked applicants to a general surgery residency program.

Barriers to Advancement in Academic Medicine: the Perception Gap Between Majority Men and Other Faculty,"Bateman, LB; Heider, L; Vickers, SM; Anderson, WA; Hood, AC; Jones, E; Ott, C; Eady, S; Fouad, MN","Background According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, women comprise 26% of full professors and 19% of medical school department chairs. African American and Latino faculty comprise 4.6% of full professors and 6.9% of department chairs. Objective Because of the lack of representation of women and racial/ethnic minority faculty at the highest levels of academic medicine, this study examines the perceptions of barriers to advancement by men and women academic medical school faculty of differing races and ethnicities to explore potential differences in perceptions by demographic group. Design Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted between July and September 2017. Participants In order to give all faculty a chance to participate, faculty of all ranks and specialties were recruited from one southeastern medical school to participate in the study. Approach Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by 3 members of the research team using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. Participants were organized into 4 groups for analysis-underrepresented in medicine (URiM) women, majority women, URiM men, majority men. Key Results Sixty-four faculty consented to participate in the study (56.2% women, 34.4% URiM). Subthemes were grouped under three main themes: Perceptions of Barriers to Advancement of Women Faculty, Perceptions of Barriers to Advancement of African American and Latino Faculty, and Perceptions of the Institutional Climate for Diversity. Majority men tended to voice distinctly different perspectives than the other three demographic groups, with the most notable differences between majority men and URiM women. Majority men tended to suggest that the advancement of women and URiM faculty was acceptable or getting better, the lack of URiM faculty in leadership was due mainly to pipeline issues, and women choose not to advance to leadership positions.

The Factors Affecting the Tenured Faculty Member Evaluation Score from the Perspective of Students of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2016,"Hamedi-Asl, P; Saleh, S; Hojati, H; Kalani, N","One of the most commonly used methods in most countries, including Iran, to determine the success rate of a professor in achieving educational goals is the evaluation of professors from the perspective of students. Since the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of this type of evaluation from the viewpoint of professors and students plays an important role in improving the quality of education, the present study aimed to determine the factors affecting the professor evaluation score from the perspective of students in Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2016. The present research was a cross-sectional descriptive study in which 287 students of Different fields studying at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2016 were selected as the sample. The required data were collected using a demographics form and a standard questionnaire on the factors affecting the students' opinions about the evaluation of professors. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (percentage and mean) and inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney U test) in SPSS-21. The results of Mann-Whitney U test showed that there is a significant difference between male and female students about the importance of teaching skills in the professor evaluation (p=0.001). Female students obtained higher scores than males in this regard. In addition, a significant difference was observed between students of different semesters about the importance of individual characteristics, teaching skills, communication skills, and educational rules in the evaluation of professors (p<0.05). The highest score on the quadruple domain was observed in students of the eighth semester. The results also indicated that there is a significant difference between students of different educational levels in terms of the importance of individual characteristics in the evaluation of professors (p<0.05). The highest score on the importance of individual characteristics in the evaluation of professors was related to master students. However, there was no significant difference between single and married students and also students of Different fields about the importance of the quadruple domains in the evaluation of professors (p>0.05). The most important domains affecting students' evaluation of professors included teaching skills (4.07 +/- 0.56), communication skills (3.84 +/- 0.68), educational rules (3.81 +/- 0.78), and individual characteristics (3.33 +/- 0.78), respectively. According to the study results, 75.46% of students believed that teaching skills are the most important domain affecting the evaluation of professors. Communication skills (67.99%), educational rules (63.92%), and individual characteristics (49.58%) ranked second to fourth. The study findings showed that teaching skills are the most important factor for students in the evaluation of professors, and communication skills, educational rules, and individual characteristics are other important factors in this regard. To achieve better and more realistic results in evaluations, it is recommended to correct and improve the evaluation tools and processes.

Gender and academic year as moderators of the efficacy of mobile app interventions to promote physical activity in adolescents: a randomized controlled trial,"Mateo-Orcajada, A; Vaquero-Cristóbal, R; Abenza-Cano, L","No previous study has analyzed the differences in the effectiveness of an intervention with mobile applications, according to gender and academic year, on the level of physical activity, body composition, and physical fitness of adolescents. For this reason, the aim of the present investigation was to establish the differences in the change in level of physical activity, kinanthropometric and derived variables, and fitness with an intervention to promote physical activity base on the use of mobile applications in adolescents according to gender and academic year. A randomized controlled trial was carried out with a 10-week intervention with mobile applications that was promoted by the physical education department of the school. The final sample consisted of 400 adolescents (210 males and 190 females; mean age: 13.96 +/- 1.21 years). A total of 240 adolescents were placed in the experimental group, and 160 were placed in the control group. Physical activity, body composition and physical fitness were measured before (pre) and after the intervention (post). During the intervention, four apps were mandatory used by the adolescents (Strava, Pacer, MapMyWalk, Pokemon Go) a minimum of three times a week. The distance to be traveled increased weekly during the intervention. The control group did not use the apps but continued to perform their physical activities as normal. The results showed that the use of mobile apps was higher in females (p < 0.001; 71.1% females vs 50.0% males) and adolescents in higher academic year (p < 0.001; 74.4% fourth academic year vs 53.8% first academic year). Moreover, the use of the apps prevented the increase of variables related to fat accumulation (body mass index (BMI), fat mass, sum 3 skinfolds, waist, and hips girths). Specifically, the differences between male and female were significant in BMI (p < 0.001; mean diff: -0.352), corrected calf girth (p = 0.008; mean diff: -0.498), fat mass (p = 0.025; mean diff: 0.748), handgrip right (p = 0.002; mean diff: -1.359), handgrip left (p = 0.002; mean diff: -1.103), and countermovement jump (p = 0.002; mean diff: -2.456), while when considering academic year, differences were significant in height (p < 0.001-0.044; mean diff: -1.099 to -0.509), sum of 3 skinfolds (p = 0.046-0.047; mean diff: -3.255), waist girth (p = 0.048; mean diff: 0.584), hip girth (p < 0.001-0.008; mean diff: -1.461 to -0.777), corrected calf girth (p = 0.019-0.029; mean diff: -0.539 to -0.482), and fat mass (p = 0.025-0.046; mean diff: 1.011 to -1.392). It can be concluded that mobile apps can be a great alternative to promote the practice of physical activity, decrease of fat variables, and improve some physical fitness variables, especially in females and adolescents in higher academic year. As a consequence of the above, gender and academic year should be considered in future interventions with mobile apps, as the effects in kinanthropometric and derived variables, and fitness and the follow-up of the intervention by adolescents may be different depending on these factors.

Why so slow? The advancement of females in neurosurgery: a 30-year analysis,Muzyka L.; ; Chapman N.; Limoges N.; Durham S.R.,"OBJECTIVE: As gender parity in medicine improves, neurosurgery lags behind. In pediatric neurosurgery, considered the most ""female-friendly"" subspecialty, determining the extent to which gender disparity has evolved over time, and how it compares to other subspecialties, can serve as an important benchmark for neurosurgery altogether. This study analyzed gender parity across different neurosurgical and subspecialty training stages to understand how female representation varies with training level and leadership positions. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Data spanning from 1990 to 2023 were extracted from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), Accreditation Council for Pediatric Neurosurgical Fellowships (ACPNF), American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS), and American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery (ABPNS) databases and American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) subspecialty websites to examine the proportions of female-identifying trainees and neurosurgeons. Information regarding females in leadership roles was gathered from publicly available sources. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Over the last 30 years, the proportion of female medical school graduates increased from 34.0% in 1990 to 51.9% in 2023 (0.45 graduates/year, R2 = 0.813). Female neurosurgery residency applicants increased from 10.5% in 1990 to 27.9% in 2023 (0.48 applicants/year, R2 = 0.694). Female neurosurgical residents increased from 7.3% in 1990 to 23.7% in 2023 (0.46 residents/year, R2 = 0.909). Female neurosurgeons obtaining ABNS certification increased from 5.0% in 1990 to 17.0% in 2023 (0.23 surgeons/year, R2 = 0.476). Female pediatric neurosurgery fellows increased from 0.0% in 1990 to 25.0% in 2023 (0.74 applicants/year, R2 = 0.369). The number of females obtaining ABPNS certification increased at a rate of 0.42 surgeons/year (R2 = 0.067). In neurosurgical academic leadership, female representation remains low: Society of Neurological Surgeons presidents at 0.98%, AANS presidents at 3.3%, CNS presidents at 0.0%, and departmental chairs at 1.5%. In pediatric neurosurgery, only 10% of division chiefs at top US News & World Report children's hospitals are female. Only 13.3% of past presidents of the AANS/CNS Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery were female; all American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons presidents have been male. There are higher proportions of female directors within ABPNS (33%) and the ACPNF board (43%). Other subspecialties have comparable female leadership representation, with 5.3% in spine, 5.1% in cerebrovascular, 5.9% in tumor, and 14.3% in functional/stereotactic. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Despite encouraging growth in the number of females entering neurosurgery over the past 3 decades, there continues to be significant gender disparity that is most pronounced at advanced career stages-in both academic organized neurosurgery and pediatric neurosurgery. Pediatric neurosurgery, due to a separate fellowship accreditation and board certification, provides the most accurate view within the subspecialties.

Evolution of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Physicians Clinical and Academic Profile by Gender,Wai K.; ; Pollack M.M.; Basu S.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine career trajectory and academic profile of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) physicians, with special focus on gender differences. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study of PCCM fellowship graduates using publicly available data. SETTING: Publicly available databases including National Provider Identifier registry, American Board of Pediatrics, Doximity, official hospital websites, and Scopus. SUBJECTS: Two thousand one hundred twenty-nine PCCM fellowship graduates employed in clinical positions in U.S. practice locations. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physician demographic characteristics included gender and time since fellowship completion. Current career and academic characteristics included employment data, publication productivity (h-index), and academic rank. Data from 2129 career PCCM physicians was included, with recent graduates showing a notable increase in female representation. Workplace characteristics revealed that most PCCM physicians worked in university-affiliated hospitals, with higher percentages of female physicians working in university-affiliated hospitals compared with male physicians. The study also highlighted significant gender disparities in academic metrics, with male physicians having higher h-indices (3 vs. 2; p < 0.001) and more publications (6 vs. 4; p < 0.001) than their female counterparts across various career phases. Additionally, the analysis showed gender differences in academic rank, with a higher proportion of female faculty holding assistant and associate professor ranks (58.2% vs. 47.5%; p < 0.001), while a greater percentage of male faculty held the rank of professor (20.2% vs. 11.1%; p < 0.001). Multiple variable regression analysis identified both male gender and time since fellowship graduation as independently associated with a physician's h-index, while only time since fellowship graduation was linked to current academic rank. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This is the first analysis of career and academic characteristics of practicing PCCM physicians, additionally studying the association of gender and career trajectory.

50950 Childcare responsibilities limit career advancement for female academic dermatologists,Ng J.; ; Dhami R.; Foster E.; Latour E.; Keller J.,"Introduction: Promotion in academic medicine depends on contributions to research, education and service. Gender disparities in leadership, publication and promotion have been identified across medical specialties, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and dermatology is not exempt from this pattern1. We conducted a survey study to evaluate how childcare responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic affected promotional opportunities for academic dermatologists. <ovid:br/>Method(s): After OHSU IRB approval, an anonymous survey was emailed to dermatologists using email listservs of Association of Professors of Dermatology, Women's Dermatologic Society, and OHSU Department of Dermatology (August - October 2022). Data was collected using Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 92 respondents were included for analysis. The majority identified as female (94%), White (75%), were married and lived with a spouse (96%). About half had a partner/spouse that also worked in healthcare. The majority had 1-2 children less than 5 in the household (86%). Respondents felt responsible for half or more of household childcare (89%), cooking/cleaning/other household duties (86%), and household income (76%). A majority agreed that their childcare option has become less reliable as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (67%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): According to our study, female academic dermatologists are still heavily burdened with multiple factors inhibiting their promotional progress in the field of academic dermatology, especially childcare access.

"Convenience behavior in German university students is associated with sociodemographic, study- and health-related factors",Schwab L.; ; Reichel J.L.; Werner A.M.; Schafer M.; Heller S.; Edelmann D.; Beutel M.E.; Letzel S.; Dietz P.; Simon P.; Kalo K.,"Background: The transition from school to university is often accompanied by a change in students' lifestyles. So far little is known whether convenience behavior is an essential factor affecting students' health and social interaction. In a heterogeneous population regard to sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics the Convenience Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) showed a better relationship between convenience-related behavior with overweight and obesity than established questionnaires. Here we assessed convenience behavior in a large well characterized cohort of university students and its association with health-related (mainly sedentary behavior and physical activity), study-related and sociodemographic factors with the Convenience Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). <ovid:br/>Method(s): A total of 4,351 students participated in an online survey, of which 3,983 (23.6 +/- 5.3 years old, 71.3% females) answered the questions concerning convenience behavior. A low value in the CBQ indicates more convenience behavior [Convenience Behavior Index (CBI) range: 3-15]. Differences with regard to sociodemographic (age, gender, body mass index), study-related (semester, degree, field of study) and health-related (physical activity, sedentary behavior) variables were examined with Mann-Whitney-U test or Kruskal-Wallis test and post-hoc tests (Bonferroni). <ovid:br/>Result(s): The CBI of men and women differed significantly (z = -6.847, p < 0.001, r = 0.11). First-year students and students beyond their first year showed significant differences (z = -2.355, p <= 0.05, r = 0.04). Differences were also found in the field of study (Chi2 (6) = 147.830, p < 0.001) and the targeted degree (Chi2 (7) = 79.985, p < 0.001). Furthermore, differences were found in the body mass index (Chi2 (5) = 70.678, p < 0.001), physical activity (Chi2 (2) = 279.040, p < 0.001) and sedentary behavior (z = -4.660, p < 0.001, r = 0.07). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results showed risk groups of convenience behavior among students [men, first-year, students enrolled in ""Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM),"" bachelor].

Gender distribution and NIH funding rank in dermatology leadership: a cross-sectional analysis,Viveiros M.D.; ; Awethe Z.; Kaffenberger J.,"In examining the influence of National Institute of Health (NIH) funding on gender distribution within dermatology leadership roles, a cross-sectional analysis of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited dermatology residencies was conducted. The gender of leadership faculty was verified using online resources, while institutions were categorized by their 2022 NIH dermatology funding status. Results revealed that male dermatologists predominantly occupied department chair roles, whereas female dermatologists were more frequently found in associate program director roles, regardless of funding status. Notably, women held most program director positions in the top NIH-funded group, though this difference was not statistically significant due to a smaller sample size. The overall gender distribution has shown progress from 2021, with a significant rise in female associate program directors and a narrowing gender gap for chairs and program directors. Despite NIH funding rank playing a minimal role in gender distribution, our study underscores positive strides towards gender equality in dermatology leadership.

Gender trends in dentistry: Dental faculty and academic leadership,Kim A.; ; Karra N.; Song C.; Linder P.J.; Bonino F.; Doig P.; Zandona A.,"OBJECTIVES: Gender equality in the healthcare workforce has been a topic of discourse for many decades. In dental academia, women's representation of enrolled students and faculty has risen consistently since the 1980s. However, women in faculty leadership positions may still be lagging when compared to men. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of women who occupy the upper echelons of academic rank and title by analyzing cross-referenced data from the American Dental Association and the American Dental Education Association on women dental school graduates in relation to academic appointments. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Gender distribution in rank, title, and appointments in the decade from 2011 to 2019, as well as percentage of women graduates over the same period, were collected for descriptive statistics. Multiple linear regression analysis, Cochran Armitage, and chi-square tests were conducted to examine trends over the years and to determine significant differences in overall percentages (p < 0.05). <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The total women faculty percentages ranged from 36% to 40%. While the lower-level rank of instructor retained a higher representation of women (56%-65%), the higher rank of professor had disproportionately lower women percentages (18%-26%). Graduates, full-time faculty, lower-level academic ranks, and higher-level academic ranks for women followed similar upward trends that were statistically significant (p < 0.05). When comparing the different groups against each other, the annual increase in women DMD/DDS graduate percentage was higher than women full-time faculty (0.28%), instructor rank (0.92%), professor rank (0.50%), and department chair appointments (0.49%). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our data show that women are still underrepresented at higher academic ranks.

Commitment to inclusion: The importance of collaboration in gender equity work,Lee J.K.; ; Levine R.B.; Yousem D.M.; Faraday N.; Skarupski K.A.; Ishii M.; Daugherty Biddison E.L.; Oliva-Hemker M.,"Despite decades of faculty professional development programs created to prepare women for leadership, gender inequities persist in salary, promotion, and leadership roles. Indeed, men still earn more than women, are more likely than women to hold the rank of professor, and hold the vast majority of positions of power in academic medicine. Institutions demonstrate commitment to their faculty's growth by investing resources, including creating faculty development programs. These programs are essential to help prepare women to lead and navigate the highly matrixed, complex systems of academic medicine. However, data still show that women persistently lag behind men in their career advancement and salary. Clearly, training women to adapt to existing structures and norms alone is not sufficient. To effectively generate organizational change, leaders with power and resources must commit to gender equity.

Women were more likely to be single (44% vs. 27%, p = 0.0423). In terms of scholarly involvement, women more frequently had additional academic pursuits than their male counterparts (92% vs. 60%, p = 0.0195). For training-related challenges, women more often reported different expectations were put on them due to their due to their background, specifically related to gender (70% vs. 33%, p = 0.0356). Women described more challenges with support staff compared to their colleagues (36% vs. 0%, p = 0.0105), and stated that gender was the reason. Women were also more likely to report that their clinical competence was challenged compared to their peers (32% vs. 7%, p = 0.0384). Outside of work, women more often felt a work-life misbalance due to coordinating childcare (64% vs. 27%, p = 0.0085).

The female-to-male ratio changed over time with ratios of 1.1:1 for those in practice over 10 years and 5.8:1 for those less than 10 years. Of providers in practice greater than 10 years, there were significantly more male vs. female full professors (72.3% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.01), less frequent male assistant professors (3% vs.17%, p < 0.01) and a similar percentage of male and female associate professors (24.6% vs. 34.3%, p = 0.2). Among those in practice for less than 10 years, there were no differences in academic rank between males and females.

The female-to-male ratio in academic REI has dramatically changed with time. Even with this shift, the majority of providers believe in a gender disparity regarding academic rank that is due to systemic factors limiting the academic advancement of females.

Exploring Gender Bias in Six Key Domains of Academic Science: An Adversarial Collaboration,Ceci S.J.; ; Kahn S.; Williams W.M.,"We synthesized the vast, contradictory scholarly literature on gender bias in academic science from 2000 to 2020. In the most prestigious journals and media outlets, which influence many people's opinions about sexism, bias is frequently portrayed as an omnipresent factor limiting women's progress in the tenure-track academy. Claims and counterclaims regarding the presence or absence of sexism span a range of evaluation contexts. Our approach relied on a combination of meta-analysis and analytic dissection. We evaluated the empirical evidence for gender bias in six key contexts in the tenure-track academy: (a) tenure-track hiring, (b) grant funding, (c) teaching ratings, (d) journal acceptances, (e) salaries, and (f) recommendation letters. We also explored the gender gap in a seventh area, journal productivity, because it can moderate bias in other contexts. We focused on these specific domains, in which sexism has most often been alleged to be pervasive, because they represent important types of evaluation, and the extensive research corpus within these domains provides sufficient quantitative data for comprehensive analysis. Contrary to the omnipresent claims of sexism in these domains appearing in top journals and the media, our findings show that tenure-track women are at parity with tenure-track men in three domains (grant funding, journal acceptances, and recommendation letters) and are advantaged over men in a fourth domain (hiring). For teaching ratings and salaries, we found evidence of bias against women; although gender gaps in salary were much smaller than often claimed, they were nevertheless concerning. Even in the four domains in which we failed to find evidence of sexism disadvantaging women, we nevertheless acknowledge that broad societal structural factors may still impede women's advancement in academic science. Given the substantial resources directed toward reducing gender bias in academic science, it is imperative to develop a clear understanding of when and where such efforts are justified and of how resources can best be directed to mitigate sexism when and where it exists.",2023,/,Psychological science in the public interest : a journal of the American Psychological Society,24,1,15EP  - 73,641128950,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15291006231163179,37098793,#778,Ceci 2023,"",""
GENDER DISPARITY IN ACADEMIC RANK: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND METAANALYSIS,Gunderson C.; ; Alshaeba S.E.; Grimshaw A.; Marhoffer E.; Holleck J.; Bastian L.; Rudikoff B.,"Background: It is well established that there is a persistent gender gap in promotion in academic medicine despite an equal number of male and female medical students for the past 20 years. Possible mediators of this gender gap include differences between men and women in years on faculty, measures of productivity such as number of publications and grants, leadership positions and direct gender bias. We performed a systematic review of studies that report rates of promotion to full professor between men and women adjusted for potential mediators. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A systematic search of Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, Cochrane Library, ERIC, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted from inception through August 18, 2022. Gender was treated as binary given the limitations of the literature. All studies were included that reported the proportion of faculty that were full professors by gender. The primary outcome was the adjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor stratified by area of medicine (Internal Medicine, Surgery, and other). Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Three hundred and twelve studies met inclusion criteria. The unadjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.35-0.40). Fourteen studies reported adjusted analyses. The overall adjusted odds ratio for promotion of women to full professor was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.45-0.80). The adjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor in Surgery was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.88) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.65-1.21) for studies limited to Internal Medicine. Overall risk of bias was high due to lack of inclusion of important confounders. Statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 83%, p< 0.001). On meta-regression, 84% of the heterogeneity was due to whether the study was from the United States, which reported lower disparity (OR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61-0.92). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Most studies continue to find a lower rate of promotion to full professor of women compared to men, even after adjustment for potential mediators such as number of publications, grants, or years on faculty. Gender disparity is particularly notable in Surgery and in studies from outside the United States. Studies limited to Internal Medicine did not find an adjusted difference in promotion.

We performed a systematic review of studies that report rates of promotion to full professor between men and women adjusted for potential mediators. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A systematic search of Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, Cochrane Library, ERIC, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted from inception through August 18, 2022. Gender was treated as binary given the limitations of the literature. All studies were included that reported the proportion of faculty who were full professors by gender. The primary outcome was adjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor stratified by area of medicine (Internal Medicine, Surgery, and other). Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Three hundred and twelve studies met inclusion criteria. The unadjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.35-0.40). Fourteen studies reported adjusted analyses. The overall adjusted odds ratio for promotion of women to full professor was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.45-0.80). The adjusted odds ratio for promotion to full professor in Surgery was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.88) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.65-1.21) for studies limited to Internal Medicine. Overall risk of bias was high due to lack of inclusion of important confounders. Statistical heterogeneity was high ( I2 = 83%, p<0.001). On metaregression, 84% of the heterogeneity was due to whether the study was from the United States, which reported lower disparity (OR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61-0.92). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Most studies continue to find a lower rate of promotion to full professor of women compared to men, even after adjustment for potential mediators such as number of publications, grants, or years on faculty. Gender disparity is particularly notable in Surgery and in studies from outside the United States. Studies limited to Internal Medicine did not find an adjusted difference in promotion. Our results suggest that differences in promotion are due both to differences in mediators of promotion and possible direct bias. Efforts to improve equity need to address both direct bias as well as the disparity in academic productivity.",2023,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,38,Supplement 2,S99,641880735,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z,,#781,Marhoffer 2023,"",""
Intersectional and place-based barriers to women's advancement in higher education,Crimmins G.; ; Casey S.; Tsouroufli M.,"Background Evidence of persistent barriers to women's advancement in higher education are well-documented. In response, over the past two decades, many Certification and Award schemes (CAS) related to gender equality, diversity and inclusion have emerged in the higher education, research, and industry sectors. The Athena Swan Charter 'is arguably the most prominent and well-known certification system for research organisations' [1]. The Athena Swan Charter was established in 2005 to combat the gender inequities in higher education and research careers faced by women in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM). The Charter's remit expanded in 2015 to encompass gender equality in academia and research in the fields of arts, humanities, social sciences, business and law. As of July 2021, there were 962 active awards in total, with 164 held by institutions and 798 by departments. Notwithstanding the significant role that Athena Swan plays in higher education institutions' gender equity policy and practice, the perceived impact of Athena Swan upon these work experiences, remains under-researched and theorised. Methods We therefore designed a research project where academics and professional staff employed in across 12 schools or units within academic institutions in the UK and Northern Ireland were invited to provide their demographic details and to describe their work experience and career opportunities. Results A total of 207 respondents participated in the survey from various institutions across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Quantitative findings revealed that even in higher education institutions that have been awarded (and thus recognised) for supporting gender equality, a higher proportion of males were: employed in a permanent/ongoing basis; more likely to be promoted, and promoted within a shorter timeframe, than females; more likely to hold a senior professorial and leadership role than females; and less likely to spend 40 hours of more on caring responsibilities than females. Furthermore, Black, and Asian participants were found to have been employed for under 5 years. The recurrent themes that emerged in the qualitative data were: women experience the role of primary carer as a barrier to career success; a gendered allocation of tasks/workload prevent access to promotion; a lack of engagement with, and appropriation of, female 'voice'; and the intersection of religion and gender can reinforce gendered and raced structures. Conclusions Analysis of these findings illuminate that, despite the implementation of gender equity plans, raced and gendered power structures within higher education institutions are maintained through 'everyday sexism' [2] and further suggest that the geographical contexts of higher education institutions not only reflect but appear to constitute intersectional experience. The outcomes demonstrate a multiplicative effect of race/religion and parental responsibility on career opportunities for women, reinforces the need for data collection and analysis that is sensitive to intersectional social identities, and recommendation to use a place-based lens to focus on social locations rather than groups in research and policy development.",2023,/,BMC Proceedings,17,Supplement 15,,643048914,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12919-023-00275-w,,#782,Crimmins 2023,"",""
Gender Disparities in Faculty Rank and Mentorship opportunities Within a Sample of US Academic Infectious Disease Divisions,Hollenberg B.; ; Cawcutt K.; Marcelin J.R.; Zimmer A.J.; Cortes-Penfield N.W.,"Background. Gender inequities in promotion within academic medicine, including academic infectious diseases (ID), are well-documented. Effective mentorship is a key component of career advancement and data show that same-gender mentorship can be valuable for women junior faculty learning to navigate academia. We compared the gender, bibliometrics, and mentorship opportunity distributions of ID faculty at each academic rank (instructor vs assistant, associate, or full professor) across several US medical centers. Methods. We randomly selected five academic medical centers from the US World News & Reports top 100 medical school rankings that had ID division websites including a faculty listing with ranks and years since graduation. We recorded each physician faculty's rank and gender based on the written biography, using a validated tool (genderize.io) to determine gender if not given, and collected each faculty's traditional bibliometric data via Google Scholar. Results. We included 221 faculty (107 women) from five ID divisions (mean 44 faculty). Women accounted for 5/12 (42%) of instructors, 62/109 (57%) of assistant professors, 19/44 (43%) of associate professors, and 21/56 (38%) of full professors. Junior faculty women (instructor or assistant) had a median 0.6 potential same-gender senior mentors per mentee within their divisions versus 1.1 for men; associate professor women had a median 1.0 potential same-gender senior mentor per mentee versus 1.7 for men. Measures of academic productivity, such as annual publications, citations, and h-index growth since graduation from fellowship were similar between men and women. Conclusion. Our findings support published studies demonstrating lower proportions of women in successively senior positions within academic ID divisions despite similar scholarly activity and suggest that fewer within-institution opportunities for senior mentorship might be a contributing factor.",2023,/,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,10,Supplement 2,S482,643250512,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.927,,#783,Hollenberg 2023,"",""
Gender Disparity in Academic Gastroenterology: Beginning of the End of the Underrepresentation of Women?,John J.J.; ; John E.S.; Pioppo L.; Gupta A.; Chokhavatia S.; Tilara A.,"Background: Though there are an increasing number of female medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in academic medicine. There have been several reasons to explain this gender disparity, including marital status, number of children, number of hours worked, job flexibility, perceptions of women as inferior leaders, gender bias, sexual harassment, and unsupportive academic climates. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This study aimed to investigate the relationship between scholarly productivity and the representation of female gastroenterologists in academia. Specifically, scholarly productivity measured by the h-index and academic rank were explored to determine if there were gender disparities in academic productivity and rank in gastroenterology. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Gastroenterology departmental listings were obtained from the Fellowship and Residency Interactive Database of the American Medical Association. The Scopus database was used to record each physician's h-index. Statistical analyses were conducted with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which compared matched samples by academic rank, and ANOVA tests, which compared multiple academic ranks. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Out of 1703 academic gastroenterologists, women account for 25% of academic physicians. Women have statistically lower h-indices at the level of Assistant Professor (p = 0.0012), and at the level of Chair (p = 0.01). There was no difference in h-indices between male and female at the rank of Associate Professor and Professor. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While these results mirror patterns appreciated in other fields of medicine, the results at the rank of Chair may suggest that despite the lower h-index compared to their male counterparts, females are perceived as having strong inherent leadership skills outside of academic productivity that are also conducive to leading a department and may be contributing to their rise to Chair.

Priority strategies to improve gender equity in Canadian emergency medicine: proceedings from the CAEP 2021 Academic Symposium on leadership,McIlveen-Brown E.; ; Morris J.; Lim R.; Johnson K.; Byrne A.; Bischoff T.; Hurley K.; Mann M.; Menchetti I.; Pardhan A.; Pham C.; Sheppard G.; Zia A.; Chan T.M.,"Objectives: Gender inequities are deeply rooted in our society and have significant negative consequences. Female physicians experience numerous gender-related inequities (e.g., microaggressions, harassment, violence). These inequities have far-reaching consequences on health, well-being and career longevity and may result in the devaluing of various strengths that female emergency physicians bring to the table. This, in turn, has an impact on patient healthcare experience and outcomes. During the 2021 Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) Academic Symposium, a national collaborative sought to understand gender inequities in emergency medicine in Canada. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used a multistep stakeholder-engagement-based approach (harnessing both quantitative and qualitative methods) to identify and prioritize problems with gender equity in emergency medicine in Canada. Based on expert consultation and literature review, we developed recommendations to effect change for the higher priority problems. We then conducted a nationwide consultation with the Canadian emergency medicine community via online engagement and the CAEP Academic Symposium to ensure that these priority problems and solutions were appropriate for the Canadian context. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Via the above process, 15 recommendations were developed to address five unique problem areas. There is a dearth of research in this important area and we hope this preliminary work will serve as a starting point to fuel further research. To facilitate these scholarly endeavors, we have appended additional documents identifying other key problems with gender equity in emergency medicine in Canada as well as proposed next steps for future research.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP)/ Association Canadienne de Medecine d'Urgence (ACMU).",2022,/,Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine,24,2,151EP  - 160,2014756199,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43678-021-00245-1,35034336,#787,McIlveen-Brown 2022,"",""
Trends in Racial and Gender Profiles of United States Academic Emergency Medicine Faculty: Cross-Sectional Survey From 2007 to 2018,Shaikh A.T.; ; Lall M.D.; Jalal S.; Raja A.S.; Fares S.; Siddiqi J.; Khosa F.,"Background: Numerous studies have reported existing disparities in academic medicine. The purpose of this study was to assess racial and gender disparity in academic emergency medicine (EM) faculty positions across the United States from 2007 to 2018. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The primary objective was to identify the racial and ethnic and gender distributions across academic ranks in EM. The secondary objective was to describe the racial and gender proportions across different tenure tracks and degrees. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Simple descriptive statistics and time series analysis were employed to assess the trends and relationship between race and gender across academic rank, type of degree, and tenure status. <ovid:br/>Result(s): When averaged, 75% of all faculty members were White physicians and 67.5% were male. Asian faculty members showed an increased representation in the lower academic ranks and underrepresented minority groups demonstrated a small increase. Asian faculty members demonstrated a significantly increasing trend at the level of instructor (t = 0.02; p = 0.034; 95% CI 0.05-1.03). Female faculty members showed a significantly decreasing trend over the study period (t = -0.01; p < 0.001; 95% CI 0.68-0.75). White academic physicians and male faculty members made up most of all degree types and tenure categories. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite an increase in proportional representation, the underrepresentation of female faculty members and those from minority groups persists in emergency medicine.

Gender inequality for tenure as Full Professor of medicine in France,Ziai S.; ; Naudet F.; Laviolle B.; Allain J.-S.,"Introduction: Under-representation of women in high academic and medical positions is reported in many countries. This study aims to compare degrees and careers between men and women tenured as Full Professors of Medicine in recent years in France. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We identified all new tenured French Full Professors between 2017 and 2021 and collected the publicly available data (gender, year of birth, curriculum) from the Bibliographic Agency for Higher Education, a public institution under the aegis of the Ministry for Higher Education Research and Innovation. The primary outcome was the gender difference in age appointment of Full Professors. Secondary outcomes were gender differences in career development. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among 820 Full Professors, only 266 (32.4%) were women.

This will allow for targeted improvements in efforts made to reduce gender gaps within academic pain medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This is a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis study evaluating pain management faculty of various positions at academic institutions across the United States. We utilized publicly available data on faculty positions and sex to analyze research impact, H-index, number of publications and citations through bibliometric and linear regression analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Our analysis found that female faculty had significantly less research output to male faculty. The three research measurement indices used in this study including H-index, number of publications, and number of citations were significantly lower in females than in males among associate and full professor faculty ranking.

Our study found that female pain physicians had a significantly less research output based on the three variables of H indices, number of publications, and number of citations compared to their male counterparts. This has been shown to have the impact on discrepancies in female faculty ranking. Interestingly, these variables were not significantly different between male and female faculty members of the same level of leadership except for program director.

Academic promotion and leadership: 'moving the needle' for the enhancement of gender equality in Tunisian higher education institutional members of the RMEI network following the TARGET framework,Ghiss M.; ; Chouari M.; Zabaniotou A.,"Although job opportunities, recruitment criteria, health insurance and social welfare are equally available regardless of sex, academic promotion at higher education institutions (HEIs) has so far been a challenging issue for women more than men. Even though there are not legislative policies or political strategies proscribing gender discrimination, the under-representation of women in high profile positions is thought-provoking as it was found by this study on collecting segregating data at the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences of Sousse (FAHSS) and to a lesser degree at the National Engineering School of Sousse (ENISO). Given insufficient research in the area under investigation, and despite the shortage of data needed for examination, this study makes use of and analyses the available data collected from Sousse University. Built upon the findings, this paper sets forth to examine impediments as challenges to progress which are encountered by women. Despite the belief that gender parity has been acquired, it is still a challenge to progress to endorse the culture of gender equality at higher education institutions.

The reasons for gender inequities in medicine, including academic EM, are multifactorial and include disadvantageous institutional parental, family, and promotion policies; workplace environment and culture; implicit biases; and a paucity of women physician leader role models, mentors, and sponsors. To address some of the challenges of gender inequities and career advancement for women in academic EM, we established an innovative, peer-driven, multi-institutional consortium of women EM faculty employed at four distinct hospitals affiliated with one medical school. The consortium combined financial and faculty resources to execute gender-specific programs not feasible at an individual institution due to limited funding and faculty availability. The programs included leadership skill-building and negotiation seminars for consortium members.

Gender disparity in dermatologic society leadership: A global perspective,Karol D.L.; ; Sheriff L.; Jalal S.; Ding J.; Larson A.R.; Trister R.; Khosa F.,"Background: In the last half-century, there has been increased representation of women in medicine. Despite this increase, there continues to be underrepresentation of women in medical leadership positions. The objective of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of gender disparity in the leadership of professional societies of dermatology worldwide. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Online databases were used to extract the names of global dermatologic societies. Individual society websites were accessed to obtain information on executive members. Data not available on society websites were obtained through internet searches. Scopus was used to obtain H-indexes and other bibliometric outcomes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Our data collection spanned 92 countries, with 1733 society leaders identified and information available for 1710. In North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East, women were in a minority in dermatology professional society leadership. In South America, Central America, and Africa, women were in a slight majority. Across all professional societies, the role of president was more frequently held by men (n = 95) as opposed to women (n = 75). Female leaders were less likely to hold concurrent academic positions as deans/chairpersons/directors (83.33%) than their male counterparts (92.06%). The median H-index of female leaders (9) was lower than that of men (14). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender disparity exists in leadership positions in professional dermatology societies. Cultural/continental specific factors should be explored further. Enhancement of institutional support, mentorship, and sponsorship for female dermatologists should be encouraged.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020",2021,/,International Journal of Women's Dermatology,7,4,445EP  - 450,2010280414,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijwd.2020.10.003,,#820,Karol 2021,"",""
Unconscious Bias in Speaker Introductions at a Vascular Surgery Meeting: The Impact of Rank and Race,Vavra A.; ; Furlough C.; Guerra A.; Hekman K.; Yoo T.; Yi J.A.; Duma N.; Stewart C.,"Objective: Unconscious bias based on attributes such as race and gender contributes to disparities in academic medicine. Previous work has demonstrated that unconscious bias can manifest in the form of address used during speaker introductions in formal academic settings. Recognition of bias is an essential first step toward addressing it. To examine the potential for bias within vascular surgery, we examined speaker introductions at the Society of Vascular Surgeons Annual Meeting to determine whether such variations in address exist. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An observational study was performed of speaker introductions from the 2019 Vascular Annual Meeting video archives. Of note, no additional years were available for study. Presentations by non-physicians were excluded. A total of six reviewers participated, and two reviewers independently assessed each video. Professional title with either full name or last name was considered a professional address. Race, gender, title, and region of practice were identified for speaker and moderator. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant associations with speaker and moderator characteristics and form of address. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 744 talks evaluated, 336 met inclusion criteria. Whereas moderators were more likely to have a more senior title, both speakers and moderators were similar with regard to gender and race distribution (Table). On multivariable regression, nonprofessional address was more common when the speaker was a trainee (odds ratio, 3.15; P =.043) and when the moderator identified as white vs non-white (odds ratio, 2.45; P =.027). Speaker race, moderator rank, and speaker/moderator geographic region and gender did not significantly impact the form of address used for speaker introduction. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Unconscious bias in vascular surgery exists as evidenced by differential speaker introductions at the Vascular Annual Meeting. Specifically, nonprofessional address was more common when the speaker was less senior in title and when the moderator was identified as white race. Gender was not a significant factor, yet this may reflect the limited sample of female meeting participants that is an additional reflection of systemic disparities. Further work must be undertaken to acknowledge these inequities and actively address these unconscious biases.

Gender Differences in Faculty Rank Among Academic Physicians: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Li B.; ; Jacob-Brassard J.; Dossa F.; Salata K.; Greco E.; Baxter N.; Al-Omran M.,"Objectives: Many studies have examined gender inequity in academic medicine; however, no comprehensive synthesis of the literature has been performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of gender differences in faculty rank among academic physicians. Secondary outcomes included publications, h-index, federal research funding, and salary. <ovid:br/>Method(s): MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, ERIC, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to July 3, 2020. All original studies reporting faculty rank stratified by gender were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers, with a third author resolving discrepancies. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Our search yielded 5897 articles. Overall, 220 studies were included with 992,275 academic physician data points. Most studies were published after 2010 (74%) using North American data (82%). Men were older (median age, 47.7 vs 43.5 years) and practiced for longer (median, 18 vs 12 years). For full professorship, 170 studies were included comparing 643,790 men with 251,501 women. Men were 2.77 times more likely to be full professors (182,271 men vs 30,349 women; odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.57-2.98; P <.00001). This difference persisted when pooling studies that adjusted for number of years in practice, specialty, publications, h-index, and federal research funding (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.04-3.20; P =.03). Subgroup analysis by decade showed improvement over time (Before 2000 [OR, 3.62; 95% CI, 3.27-4.01]; 2000-2009 [OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.36-3.43], 2010-2020 [OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.48-2.80]). Results were similar for countries within and outside of North America. Women were less likely to be full professors across the 24 specialties analyzed, with vascular surgery ranking eighth in achieving gender parity (Table). Men published more papers than women (absolute difference, 17.2 papers; 95% CI, 14.7-19.7; P <.00001) and had a higher h-index (absolute difference, 5.17; 95% CI, 3.97-6.37; P <.00001). Men were also more likely to receive federal research funding (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.41-2.09; P <.00001) and have higher salaries (absolute difference $33,256; 95% CI, $25,969-$40,542; P <.00001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender inequity in academic medicine exists across all specialties and multiple measures of success, including full professorship, publications, h-index, research funding, and salary. The gender gap in faculty rank persists after controlling for experience, academic productivity, and specialty. Of the 24 specialties analyzed, vascular surgery ranks above average in achieving gender parity in full professorship. Although there has been improvement over the past 3 decades, greater efforts are needed to support women in academic medicine.

"Work, life, and the gender effect: Perspectives of ACVIM Diplomates in 2017. Part 1-Specialty demographics and measures of professional achievement",Morello S.L.; ; Colopy S.A.; Chun R.; Buhr K.A.,"Background: Barriers to achieving work-life balance, as well as gender-based differences, exist in the male-dominated surgical specialty in veterinary medicine. Similar information does not exist for the more feminized American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). Hypothesis/Objectives: To provide data on the professional and personal lives of Diplomates of the ACVIM so as to help define the state of the specialty, including gender-related differences, and identify areas requiring intervention to improve work-life balance. Sample: A total of 896 surveys (781 completed) of Diplomates of the ACVIM, including cardiology, large animal internal medicine, neurology, oncology, and small animal internal medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An 82-item online survey was distributed in February 2017 to ACVIM Diplomates via their respective ACVIM listserv. Participation was voluntary. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty percent of the total ACVIM registered membership responded and 26% completed surveys; 25% were men and 75% were women. Specialists in academia worked significantly more hours, with larger numbers of diplomates per specialty section, and made less money compared with those in private practice. Women were less likely to report full-time employment, practice ownership, or higher academic rank, and reported 20% lower income overall (after adjustment for relevant factors) as compared with men. Men and women differed in their subjective assessment of the effect of gender in the workplace. Eighty-three percent of respondents were somewhat satisfied or better with their career.

The proportion of male and female editors in women's health journals: A critical analysis and review of the sex gap,Grinnell M.; ; Higgins S.; Yost K.; Ochuba O.; Lobl M.; Grimes P.; Wysong A.,"Background: Historically, women have been underrepresented in leadership positions in medicine. The reasons for this are multifactorial. In recent years, women's representation in medicine has improved. However, inequities in the proportion of men and women in medical leadership remain, especially with regard to editorial journal boards. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aimed to explore current trends of women in leadership positions on journal editorial boards. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A comprehensive search for women's health journals was performed in collaboration with university librarians in February 2019 using EMBASE, Scopus, SciFinder, and MEDLINE records for journals with relevance to women's health. Each journal was e-mailed to verify the accuracy of the journal editorial boards listed on their respective webpages. Five categories, as well as the totals for each journal, were analyzed for the proportion of women versus men: editor-in-chief, associate editor, deputy editor, and section editor, and other. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Women comprised the minority of positions on women's health editorial boards. Of the total 1440 board members included, 602 members (42%) were women and 838 members (58%) were men. Women occupied 54 of 132 editor-in-chief positions (41%), 257 of 596 associate editor positions (43%), 13 of 42 deputy editor positions (30%), 46 of 120 section editor positions (38%), and 232 of 549 other editor positions (42%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although the sex gap in leadership in medicine is improving, it is still present. Our findings suggest that women are underrepresented as editors at most levels in women's health journals centered on topics such as reproductive health, obstetrics and gynecology, perinatology, gynecological oncology, and breastfeeding. With sponsorship/mentorship for women, flexible scheduling, and considerate thought in leadership appointment, this sex gap will continue to improve.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2020,/,International Journal of Women's Dermatology,6,1,7EP  - 12,2004624892,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijwd.2019.11.005,,#828,Grinnell 2020,"",""
Gender and race trends in academic rank of dermatologists at top U.S. institutions: A cross-sectional study,Stewart C.; ; Lipner S.R.,"Background: Despite growth in the proportion of women and underrepresented minorities in the dermatology workforce, gender and racial differences persist. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study sought to analyze the differences in academic rank between genders and races while controlling for achievement indicators. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data from 15 institutions, selected based on residency program rankings, were analyzed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Women were well-represented as assistant professors (60.7% vs. 37.6% of men; p < .001) and underrepresented as full professors (17.0% vs. 37.6%; p < .001).

Contract Negotiation Skills: A Workshop for Women in Medicine,Simone A.M.; ; Simone M.; Block L.; LaVine N.,"Introduction: Contract negotiation is a high-stakes interaction, yet most physicians are never taught negotiation skills. Studies suggest that women, as compared with men, display a lower propensity to initiate negotiations and negotiate less competitively, highlighting a need for training to help level the playing field for female physicians. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We devised a learner-centered workshop for female physicians that included a mini-didactic on negotiation principles, a question-and-answer time with a lawyer, an interactive role-play on contract negotiation style, and guided reflection. The workshop was intended for women in medicine from the level of medical student to full professor. The workshop was evaluated by pre- and postworkshop surveys with quantitative questions assessing perceived comfort with and knowledge of negotiation skills and strategies, as well as qualitative questions assessing lessons learned and areas for improvement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): After the workshop, participants (n = 34) reported significantly improved comfort with contract negotiation (p < .01) and with negotiation skills and strategies (p < .01). Through qualitative evaluation, we discovered that participants gained an appreciation for the self-advocacy in negotiation, as well as a better understanding of negotiation logistics. We also received positive feedback from participant comments, with most learners reporting that the topic was useful and worthwhile. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): We believe that this workshop fills a gap in the literature regarding contract negotiation training for physicians while also helping to level the playing field with regard to female physicians and the gender pay gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Simone et al.",2020,/,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,16,"(Simone) General Internal Medicine Fellow, Department of Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell; Physician, Internal Medicine, Allina Health(Simone) Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral",10910,632333384,https://dx.doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10910,32656331,#831,Simone 2020,"",""

Gender and academic promotion of Canadian general surgeons: a cross-sectional study,Gawad N.; ; Tran A.; Martel A.B.; Baxter N.N.; Allen M.; Manhas N.; Balaa F.K.,"BACKGROUND: Gender disparities in faculty rank have yet to be studied among Canadian physicians. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in region, training, research productivity and years in practice explain gender differences in academic promotion among Canadian general surgeons. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We developed a cross-sectional database of faculty-appointed general surgeons practising in the hospitals affiliated with the 17 universities within the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada in 2017 using publicly available directories, university and hospital websites, and direct communication. The data were collected between October and December 2018 and included gender, residency completion year, graduate education, fellowships, number of publications and Scopus h-index; faculty lists and professorship status were verified by program administrators or division heads of their respective divisions. The dependent variable was binary: full professor or not. A combined outcome of associate or full professor was also analyzed. We analyzed all variables in a multivariable logistic regression model. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of the 17 institutions contacted, all but 1 confirmed the faculty lists and professorship status. A total of 405 surgeons were included, of whom 111 (27.4%) were women. Sixty-eight women (61.3%) and 120 men (40.8%) were assistant professors, and 9 women (8.1%) and 75 men (25.5%) were full professors. Although on average women had completed residency more recently than men (15.2 yr v. 19.2 yr, p < 0.001), there was no difference between men and women in the mean number of publications as residents (2.98 v. 2.74, p = 0.7) or per year of practice (3.12 v. 2.09, p = 0.2), number of fellowships pursued (p = 0.7) or graduate education (p = 0.2).

Gender distribution in United States anaesthesiology residency programme directors: trends and implications,Gonzalez L.S.; ; Fahy B.G.; Lien C.A.,"The under-representation of women in academic leadership roles, including in anaesthesiology, is a well-documented phenomenon that has persisted for decades despite more women attending medical school, participating in anaesthesiology residencies, and joining academic faculties. The percentage of female anaesthesiologists who hold senior academic ranks or leadership roles, such as chair, lags behind the percentage of female anaesthesiologists overall. Trends towards increasing the numbers of women serving in educational leadership roles, specifically residency programme directors, suggest that there are areas in which academic anaesthesiology has been, and can continue, improving gender imbalance.

Promoting academic women through recognition: Nominations are essential,Press V.G.; ; Scheetz M.H.; Oyler J.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of academic award recipients across medical specialties have been men, a phenomenon documented across multiple fields. Award recognition is critical to promotion, funding, and an indication of regional and national status. Therefore, gender disparities in awards may impact work place inequities. We evaluated gender distribution among award recipients at our hospital fater piloting an award nomination intervention to increase female awardees. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): For this pre/post evaluation we obtained historical lists from our Department of Medicine (DOM) and Biological Sciences Division (BSD) of award recipients and piloted a nomination intervention to identify eligible female nominees. Gender distribution among award recipients was compared pre- intervention and post-intervention years using chi square tests. To account for national trends of decreasing gender disparities, we conducted a sensitivity analysis limiting our preintervention period to the same number of years as the post-intervention period. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Historical awardee lists were available from 2006-2016 (DOM) and 2011-2017 (BSD). Pre-intervention, 39% (range=25- 58%) and 38% (18-57%) of awardees were women in the DOM and BSD, respectively. The intervention was implemented in 2018 (DOM) and 2017 (BSD). The percent of women awardees significantly increased to 56% (25-50%; p=0.02) and 56% (55-65%; p=0.02), in the DOM and BSD post-intervention, respectively. Results remained significant when restricting to similar pre and post number of years (DOM pre-intervention: 33%, [29-37%], p=0.045) (BSD pre-intervention: 34%, [18-43%], p=0.02) in a sensitivity analysis. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): We found that a simple, easily reproducible, low resource intervention significantly increased the number of deserving women receiving awards within our Department and Division. Because we only increased the number of nominated woman and did not implement any interventions with regard to the decision process, it is possible that the low proportion of women awardees prior to our intervention was due, in part, to qualified women being over looked, perhaps due to implicit bias. It is important to note, however, that implicit bias could still impede deserving women from receiving recognition for other awards, such as those that rely on clinical productivity and/or trainee evaluations. Future work can establish whether interventions can successfully address these factors. Since nomination bias, however, is likely pervasive, other programs, sections, departments, and/or divisions could easily develop lowcost, feasible nominating processes at their institutions.",2020,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,35,SUPPL 1,S243,633957790,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-05890-3,,#839,Press 2020,"",""

340 Sex-Based Barriers to the Advancement of Women in Academic Emergency Medicine: A Multi-Institutional Survey Study,Graham E.M.; ; Ferrel M.; Wells K.; Egan D.J.; MacVane C.Z.; Gisondi M.A.; Burns B.D.; Madsen T.E.; Fix M.L.,"Study Objectives: The number of leadership positions held by women within academic medicine remain stagnant despite an increasing number of women entering medicine and in faculty positions. Exploring the unique experiences and challenges faced by women in emergency medicine may provide a framework in which to support and train future leaders. The objective of this multi-institutional survey study was to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect the career trajectories of women in academic emergency medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An IRB-approved, electronic survey was distributed to women faculty members in emergency medicine at eight institutions across the United States. Anonymous responses were collected between November 2019 and January 2020. Survey items assessed five domains: determination, resiliency, career support and obstacles, career aspiration, and sex discrimination. Response options utilized a Likert 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) and analyzed using two-sided t-tests. Responses for each question and category were averaged and deemed significant if the average was greater than or equal to 4 in the affirmative, or less than or equal to 2 in the negative. Additionally, we compared junior faculty (<10 years in practice) and senior faculty (>/=10 years in practice). Demographic questions and others reported as proportions were reassigned into binary format and analyzed using z-score calculations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 109 eligible faculty, 59 participated in the study (54.1% response rate) and 32 were senior faculty members. Years in practice ranged from < 5 years to 35-40 years with a median interval of 10-14 years. Significant findings include a positive categorical average for resiliency, with an average of 4.02. Career obstacles include a lack of confidence during negotiations, with only 27% (16/59) reporting confidence discussing salary, benefits, and promotions. Childbearing and child rearing were not considered significant barriers in career advancement. Of the respondents, 96.6% (57/59) disagreed that being a woman is advantageous in medicine with an average of 2.00. Additionally, 76% (45/59) of participants reported sex discrimination by colleagues or supervisors, and 15% (7/45) of those individuals also reported at least one sexual assault and/or battery by colleagues or supervisors during their careers. Senior faculty were more likely than junior faculty to relocate to advance their careers (p=0.010), to sacrifice career advancement for family (p=0.040), to have been PI of a research study project (19 vs. 7), and to have received a grant (11 vs 7). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this multicenter survey of women emergency medicine faculty, high levels of resiliency likely contribute to career advancement.

47: Sex-based differences in gynecologic surgeon imposter syndrome and leadership and promotion in an academic hospital,Kisby C.K.; ; Mara K.C.; Laughlin S.; Occhino J.A.; Green I.,"Objectives: The failure to internalize success, in the form of imposter syndrome, may be one contributor to the sex-based discrepancies in academic advancement in gynecologic surgeons. Our goal was to explore sex-based differences in imposter syndrome and associations with academic promotion and leadership attainment. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Gynecologic surgeons at one academic institution were surveyed. The survey consisted of the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; higher score indicates higher imposter tendencies), and institutional culture questions using a 5-point Likert scale. Respondents disclosed academic rank and leadership positions (reported as leadership-years). Descriptive statistics are reported as frequencies and percentages or medians and interquartile ranges. The CIPS score, leadership-years, and Likert-type questions were compared between sexes using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Other categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The response rate was 60% (23/35 female, 9/18 male). Median CIPS scores were not statistically different (female 61 [46-72], male 46 [44-51]; p=0.07); however, for 7/20 questions, women had statistically higher imposter tendencies. There was a wide range of female scores regardless of career stage (Figure 1). Men did not score higher in imposter tendencies for any questions. Females exhibited higher imposter tendencies pertaining to fear of living up to future expectations following praise (p=0.03) or success (p=0.01). Women tended to agree with statements such as ""I dread others evaluating me"" (p=0.01) and ""I'm afraid I may fail, even though I generally do well at what I attempt"" (p=0.004). Males reported more growth in confidence since their training (p=0.02) and more strongly disagreed with the statement ""I hesitate prior to declaring a procedure complete"" (male 100% vs female 62%, p=0.003). Male faculty outranked female faculty (p<0.001); however, leadership-years were not statistically different between sexes (females 4 [2-5], males 11 [7-22]; Table 1). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Overall CIPS scores were not statistically different between sexes; certain imposter tendencies were higher in females.

Is Academic Medicine Making Mid-Career Women Physicians Invisible?,Lewiss R.E.; ; Silver J.K.; Bernstein C.A.; Mills A.M.; Overholser B.; Spector N.D.,"In this perspective piece, we describe a multifactorial phenomenon whereby academic women physicians become invisible in the mid-career stage. Barriers, both small and large, cause a cumulative inequity effect, and women may leave academic medicine. Certainly, family and lifestyle choices play a role. And as we describe, so is a situation created where women become discouraged and disillusioned. We describe the growing evidence of subtle disparities, or micro-inequities, that cause women to be less visible and marginalized. Over time, early career women transition to mid-career with an accumulation of these micro-inequities. Women have more difficulty in building their academic portfolios and curriculum vitae-core components of academic promotion. They comprise greater than 50% of the health care workforce; yet, they are underrepresented in top leadership positions. For example, only 22% of full professors, 18% of department chairs, and 17% of medical school deans are women. Macro-inequities, which are observable and measurable, are also well documented. For example, women receive less compensation than men for the same job. We examine the contributing and causative processes and offer suggestions on how to promote equity among highly qualified mid-career women as they graduate from training and move beyond the early career stage.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2020,/,Journal of Women's Health,29,2,187EP  - 192,630976801,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.7732,31593525,#847,Lewiss 2020,"",""
Gender Differences in Retention and Promotion Among Generalists Who Graduated From Research-Intensive Fellowships,Chaiyachati K.H.; ; Liao J.M.; Weissman G.E.; Hubbard R.A.; Morgan A.U.; Buehler A.; Shea J.A.; Armstrong K.A.,"Background: Generalists who pursue research-intensive fellowships develop research skills and mentor-mentee relationships. Whether gender disparities in retention and promotion exist among this research-trained cohort is understudied. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): We measured whether disparities exist among graduates of research-intensive fellowships and how mentorship influences them. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We surveyed generalists (internal medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, combined internal medicine-pediatrics) between July and August 2016 who graduated from research-intensive fellowships. Generalists (""mentees"") were asked whether they remained or were promoted, and to name up to 10 influential mentors during or within 5 years of fellowship. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between mentee gender and retention and promotion. Next, we separately included 3 network characteristics: (1) mentee degrees (number of mentors reported per mentee); (2) mean mentor betweenness centrality (importance of each mentor within the network); and (3) largest community membership (mentee status in the largest interconnected mentor-mentee group within the network). All models adjusted for generalists' race, specialty, fellowship institution, and publications. <ovid:br/>Result(s): One hundred sixty-two graduates (51%) representing 19 institutions responded. In adjusted analyses, compared to men, women were as likely to remain in academic medicine (odds ratio [OR] 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-4.89; P = .20), but less likely to be promoted within 5 years of fellowship (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.09-0.80; P = .018).

"Gender Differences in Authorship in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia: A 28-Year Analysis of Publications Originating From the United States, 1990-2017",Pagel P.S.; ; Freed J.K.; Lien C.A.,"Objective: Gender-based differences in scholarship among cardiothoracic anesthesiologists have not been studied. The authors examined the gender distribution of authorship of original research articles, case reports, review articles, and editorials in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (JCVA) originating from the United States during four 3-year intervals to determine temporal changes in productivity of women in cardiothoracic anesthesiology. The authors tested the hypothesis that scholarly output of women has increased progressively in JCVA over time concomitant with greater participation in first, last, and corresponding author roles. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Observational study. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): Internet analysis. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Authors of research articles, case reports, review articles, and editorials published in JCVA in 1990-92, 1999-2001, 2008-10, and 2015-17. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): None. <ovid:br/>Measurements and Main Results: The gender of each author was determined by inspection of the first name. If gender could not be established easily, the author's institutional website was examined or an internet search using the Google search engine was conducted. First, last, and corresponding authors as well as coauthors were noted for each article. A total of 1,195 publications with 4,982 authors (1,032 women; 20.7%) were examined. Gender was identified positively in 98.5% of authors. Women were first, last, and corresponding authors on 22.4%, 10.3%, and 14.6% of publications, respectively. The percentage of women who were authors increased from 12.1% in 1990-92 to 20.9% in 1999-2001 (p < 0.05), but plateaued in 2008 to 2010 (22.3%) and 2015 to 2017 (22.9%). Greater percentages of women were first authors (26.2%), senior authors (11.8%), and corresponding authors (16.6%) in 2015 to 2017 compared with 1990 to 1992 (9.6%, 7.0%, and 8.7%, respectively; p < 0.05 for each). The contributions of women to research articles and case reports were primarily responsible for these observed increases, although women also made a substantial impact with review articles in 2015 to 2017. The percentage of publications that included at least 1 female author in any capacity increased in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05) from 31.0% (1990-1992) to 74.4% (2015-2017). The proportion of female first or last authors (35.0%) appearing in JCVA during 2015 to 2017 was modestly higher than the current percentage of female cardiothoracic anesthesiologists practicing in departments with accredited fellowship programs (29.1%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results indicate that scholarly output of women rose in JCVA over time, but gains in productivity have plateaued more recently.

Military Medicine and the Academic Surgery Gender Gap,Herrick-Reynolds K.; ; Brooks D.; Wind G.; Jackson P.; Latham K.,"INTRODUCTION: Gender disparity in academic medicine has been well described in the civilian sector. This has not yet been evaluated in the military health system where hundreds of female surgeons are practicing. Military service limits factors such as part time work and control over time spent away from family, which are often cited as contributors to the pay and promotion gap in civilian academic medicine. The military has explicit policies to limit discrimination based on gender. Pay between men and women is equal as it is based on rank and time in rank. One would expect to see less disparity in promotion through the academic ranks for military female surgeons given this otherwise equal treatment. This has not previously been objectively tracked or reported. It is beneficial to characterize the military academic medicine gender gap and benchmark against national data to define the academic gender gap and lay the groundwork for future work to identify factors contributing to the observed difference. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was granted exemption from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) Internal Review Board (IRB). The Uniformed Services University (USU) Department of Surgery academic appointment list was reviewed to assess female representation in the categories of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Other. Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) were assessed for total numbers of female surgeons on active duty, and numbers were compared with nationally published Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) data using a logistic regression model. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There was a higher proportion of women in academic positions in the civilian cohort than in the military cohort (OR: 1.84; CI: 1.53-2.21, p < .0001). This difference was observed at every level of academic achievement. A higher percentage of women were observed at lower levels of professorship than at higher levels; instructors were more likely to be women than assistant professor (OR: 1.44, CI:1.16-1.79), associate professor (OR: 2.24, CI: 1.77-2.84), or full professor (OR:4.61, CI: 3.57-5.94). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Fewer female surgeons in military medicine hold academic appointment when compared with their counterparts in civilian medicine. Similar to the civilian sector, military academic surgery also demonstrates less likelihood of female representation in higher academic stations. This discrepancy in representation follows a linear trend over the different ranks. This discrepancy has not been previously documented. The military offers a unique opportunity to study the issue of gender imbalance in academic promotion practices given its otherwise equal treatment of males and females. Additional studies will be necessary to understand uniformed female surgeons' barriers to academic advancement.<ovid:br/>Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.",2019,/,Military medicine,184,9-10,383EP  - 387,628516897,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz083,31241143,#853,Herrick-Reynolds 2019,"",""
Identifying Gender Disparities and Barriers to Measuring the Status of Female Faculty: The Experience of a Large School of Medicine,Kuo I.C.; ; Levine R.B.; Gauda E.B.; Bodurtha J.; Clements J.; Fivush B.; Ishii L.,"Background: Women in academic medicine are not attaining parity with men in several domains. This issue is not only one of fairness; some funding agencies are requesting data on gender benchmarking. However, most published reports on gender disparities have not included examination of trends or actionable recommendations to address them. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): The Dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine charged the Committee on the Status of Women (CSW) with conducting a comprehensive review of gender equity. In 2014, the CSW identified key domains important for academic success and created a sustainable framework to monitor trends by gender. Utilizing data from multiple key sources, the CSW measured differences in the domains of academic promotion, leadership, and satisfaction. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Gender differences were present in each domain. Data were not centralized and not readily available for most domains. The CSW recommended strategies to address gender disparities and created a set of measurable recommendations to monitor progress. The recommendations include requiring detailed descriptions of departmental organizational leadership charts; diverse compositions of both search committees and applicant pools; increased proportion of female faculty in top-tier leadership positions; and transparent departmental promotions criteria and processes. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To maintain progress, we recommend that data be readily and easily accessible from a central institutional registry rather than come from multiple sources, that data be analyzed on a regular basis, and that results be shared across the institution to ensure transparency and accountability.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",2019,/,Journal of Women's Health,28,11,1569EP  - 1575,629881708,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2018.7610,31268398,#858,Kuo 2019,"",""

Gender Equity and Career Advancement: Implications for Hospice and Palliative Medicine (TH352),Johnson K.S.; ; O'Mahony S.; Chen H.; Hingle S.; Moyer D.,"Objectives: *Describe disparities in the experience of female physicians compared to their male counterparts.*Describe specific challenges more commonly faced by female physicians and potential consequences with case examples.*Illustrate strategies for addressing gender disparities and promoting gender equity. Over the last 25 years, the proportion of physicians who are women has doubled from 17% to 36%. Furthermore, 46% of physicians in training and over half of U.S. medical students are women. While this significant increase in gender diversity has rapidly changed what the physician work force ""looks like"", there is a significant and persistent gap in the experience of female physicians. Compared to their male counterparts, studies show that female physicians are paid less across specialties and are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positons despite their increasing representation in the physician workforce. Women may also experience lack of mentorship, workplace discrimination, gender bias, sexual harassment and challenges related to work-life integration based on their roles outside of the workplace. While gender equity is a salient issue across all specialties, efforts to improve the experience of women are especially important to the field of hospice and palliative medicine where women make up two-thirds of the total workforce, 47% of physicians, and over 60% of HPM fellows in training-proportions considerably larger than in general physician workforce. Given the important contribution of women to the field of hospice and palliative medicine not only in terms of the volume of clinical care provided but also related to leadership, education, and research, addressing gender equity is essential to efforts to ensure that the field is able to meet the demands of the growing population of seriously ill patients and their families.

Promoting risk identification and reduction of cardiovascular disease in women through collaboration with obstetricians and gynecologists: A presidential advisory from the American Heart Association and the American college of obstetricians and gynecologi,Brown H.L.; ; Warner J.J.; Gianos E.; Gulati M.; Hill A.J.; Hollier L.M.; Rosen S.E.; Rosser M.L.; Wenger N.K.,"In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of Science) published a seminal monograph, Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?,1 describing the importance of both sex and gender on human biology and physiology. Gender-specific medicine, which recognizes gender differences and similarities in cardiovascular disease recognition, prevention, and management, has exerted a powerful salutatory effect on women. Significant improvement in mortality and morbidity rates in women have been seen over the past 2 decades, in part as a result of initiatives such as the American Heart Association's (AHA's) Go Red For Women movement. Go Red For Women initially focused on raising awareness of heart disease as the No. 1 killer of women. This campaign expanded gender-focused research and the development of gender-based guidelines that led to a significant reduction in the rates of death among women. Despite these advances, gender-based inequalities continue, with women being less likely to receive guideline-recommended diagnostic testing and therapies. Furthermore, despite the above-stated declines in mortality, more recently there has been an increase in mortality rates in women.2 Despite significant efforts to raise awareness about heart disease, the most recent data show that only 45% of women identify heart disease as their leading cause of death and that fewer than half of primary care physicians consider cardiovascular disease to be a top concern in women, after breast health and weight.3 A majority of women consider their obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) to be their primary care physician, particularly women during their childbearing years, and we know that many of the life-span milestones for women impart unique effects on cardiovascular health, particularly pregnancy and menopause. Shaw et al4 use the term healthcare team for women to describe the importance of collaboration among clinicians who care for women in order to improve quality and equitable healthcare gaps in women. We now know that 90% of women have at least 1 risk factor for developing heart disease and that optimal prevention strategies (eg, the AHA's Life's Simple 7) begin decades before clinical heart disease is apparent. For these and many other reasons, a partnership with an OB/GYN to optimize early identification and modification of risk factors for heart disease and stroke can be a critical element in improving women's health.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9;2018 American Heart Association, Inc.",2018,/,Circulation,137,24,e843EP  - e852,624067512,https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000582,29748185,#866,Brown 2018,"",""

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of Board certified academic MFM physicians. Physicians were identified in July 2017 from the websites of academic institutions in the U.S. with MFM fellowship programs. Academic rank and NIH funding were compared by gender. Data on potential confounders were collected including years since Board certification, region of practice, additional degrees (PhD or Masters degree), number of publications, and h-index (a metric of scholarly productivity that combines the number of publications with the number of times the publications have been cited). Categorical variables were compared with the Chisquare test of independence, nonparametric continuous variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank-sum as appropriate, and multivariate logistic regression was used to generate adjusted odds ratios. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): We identified 659 MFM physicians (312 (47.3%) male and 347 (52.7%) female) at 72 institutions.

Is there a gender or racial promotion disparity in academic urology?,Breyer B.; ; Fang R.; Anger J.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Over the past decade, increasing numbers of women are entering academic urology, promoting more gender balance in a field long dominated by men. Reports have shown that women advance along academic promotion in many fields of medicine and surgery more slowly than men for unclear reasons. Timely promotion and assessment is important for retention of faculty and has implications for salary parity and job satisfaction. We sought to better understand promotion time lines across gender and race/ethnicity and how academic output impacts promotion. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We examined data from the 2017 AUA Census. A subset cohort that endorsed having an academic appointment were asked questions regarding their promotion time line. We obtained demographic and academic output information including the number of peer-reviewed articles published and types of grants obtained (NIH, DOD, PCORI, other federal agencies and foundationfunded grants). Complex survey weights were used to make population projections. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 554 urologists endorsed having an academic appointment, representing 2,991 urologists in academic medical centers in the United States. Among those 2,991 academic urologists, 12.6% of them are women, 80.3% are white, 6.5% are Hispanic. On average, women took 1.2 years longer than men to advance from Assistant to Associate Professor,7.3 years (95% CI 6.8-7.8) vs 6.1 years, 95% CI 5.7-6.5, p<0.001). Advancement from Associate to Professor was similar in women and men (6.0 years (95% CI 5.1-6.9) vs. 6.4 (95% CI 5.8-7, p<0001). The time line for promotion was not statistically different across race/ethnicity. Women were less likely to be a principal investigator (PI) on a federal grant than men, although this did not reach statistical significance (33.5% (95% CI 24.1-44.4% vs 47.5% (95% CI 42.4-52.6%, p=0.893). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Women took 1.2 years longer to reach Associate Professor than men, while there was parity in promotion to Professor. Race/ethnicity did not appear to impact the number of years to promotion. Further research is needed to elucidate whether child rearing, gender bias, or other factors are associated with a delay in promotion of women in urology.

Sex differences in academic achievement and faculty rank in academic infectious diseases,Manne-Goehler J.; ; Kapoor N.; Blumenthal D.; Stead W.,"Background. Sex differences in faculty achievement in academic medicine have been described, but little is known about these differences in infectious diseases (ID). This study assesses differences in faculty rank between female and male infectious disease faculty with academic appointments at US medical schools. Methods. We analyzed a complete database of US physicians with medical school faculty appointments in 2014. This database consists of a linkage between the American Association of Medical Colleges faculty roster and a comprehensive physician database from Doximity, a professional networking website for doctors and includes physician age, sex, years since residency completion, publications, National Institutes of Health grants, and registered clinical trials for all academic physicians by specialty. We estimated sex differences in key metrics of academic achievement, including publications and faculty rank, among faculty physicians within ID. Multivariable regression models with medical school-specific fixed effects were used to assess sex differences in full professorship by specialty and the relationship between these factors and achieving the rank of full professor within ID. Results. Among 2,016 academic ID physicians [Female: 742 (37%)], women accounted for 48.1% of assistant professors, 39.7% of associate professors, and 19.2% of full professors, when compared with men at each level. Women faculty members were younger than men (mean: 48.4 years vs. 54.0 years, P < 0.001) and had fewer total (mean: 24.1 vs. 37.8, P < 0.001) and first/last author publications (mean: 16.7 vs. 32.2, P < 0.001). In adjusted models, the rate of full professorship (vs. assistant or associate) among female compared with male infectious disease physicians was large and highly significant (absolute adjusted difference =-8.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-11.9% to-4.1%). This adjusted difference was greater in ID than in cardiology (-4.7%, 95% CI:-7.9% to-1.3%), hematology (-1.5%, 95% CI:-6.2% to 3.2%), or endocrinology (-0.2%, 95% CI:-4.9% to 4.6%). Conclusion. Significant sex differences in publications and achieving the rank of full professor exist in academic ID, after adjustment for multiple factors known to influence these outcomes.

Endorectal advancement flaps for anorectal fistula in Crohn's disease in the era of immune therapy,Ganyo M.T.; ; Trinidad S.; Ramamoorthy S.; Parry L.; Lopez N.; Steinhagen R.; Eisenstein S.,"Purpose/Background: Anorectal fistulae resultant from Crohn's disease (CD) are a unique clinical challenge. Current treatments remain unsatisfactory due to recurrent fistulae and incomplete closure. Seton drainage is typically the initial treatment and select patients may undergo second stage repair utilizing several surgical procedures. The advent of immune therapy (IT) for CD has altered the way in which CD fistulae have responded to treatment. Some patients have complete resolution solely with IT, yet many still require surgical closure. We have employed ERAF as our second stage procedure for anorectal fistulae in CD patients and report our outcomes in 39 patients. Methods/Interventions: The surgical database of 8 colorectal surgeons was queried for patients who underwent ERAF from 2007-2017 at The University of California in San Diego and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Charts were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of CD, use of IT, fistula characteristics, surgical treatment and outcomes. Significance was determined using the student's T-Test. Results/Outcome(s): 557 ERAFs were performed over a 10-year period, 41 (7.4%) in 39 patients with perianal CD with an average follow up of 797 days. There were no significant differences in age, gender, presence of small bowel disease, fistulae characteristics, number of prior Seton or surgical procedures between patients who had recurrences and those that did not. There were significantly fewer recurrences in patients who had been diverted prior to surgery (p=0.003). See Table 1. 73.2% (n=30) of patients were on IT at an average of 380 days prior to surgery. 8% (n=11) of patients were taking zero agents, 43.9% (n=18) were on one agent and 29.3% (n=11) were on two agents. There were no differences in fistulae recurrence for patients taking one or two agents, however the duration of one agent therapy had significantly fewer recurrences (p=0.03). 17% (n=7) of patients used a combination of Infliximab +Thiopurines. None of these patients had recurrent fistulae (p=0.006). The overall recurrence rate after ERAF was 19.5% (n=8) with an average of 64.5 days until recurrence was diagnosed. Of the 8 patients who had a recurrence, 6 underwent a variety of secondary techniques for fistula closure and 5 were successful. The salvage rate for recurrent fistulae was 63% (n=5). In combination with the patients who did not have a recurrence, the overall healing rate was 92.7%. Conclusions/Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the largest series of CD patients undergoing ERAF for the treatment of anorectal fistula. This study helps point to several factors that may improve fistula closure for these patients. Diversion prior to surgery and patients who were on Infliximab + Thiorpurine did not have a fistulae recurrence. Patients who were on IT longer prior to surgery were more likely to achieve successful closure. There is clearly a benefit to adding IT to ERAF when addressing Crohn's fistula.

Sociodemographic Factors Differentiating the Consumer and the Motivations for Functional Food Consumption,Kraus A.; ; Annunziata A.; Vecchio R.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the (1) role of gender, age, and education in the evaluation of multidimensional criteria of the purchase of functional products, which were (a) quality and organoleptic attributes, (b) attributes of packaging and labeling, (c) healthful properties, (d) functional components, (e) base product (carrier) and (2) most important motives for the purchase and consumption of functional food among consumers of different sociodemographic profiles. <ovid:br/>Design(s): The data were collected in direct interviews. The sample (n = 200) consisted of 137 women and 63 men age 18-60 years. The research tool was a questionnaire divided into 4 sections. The first one included quality attributes. The second one included healthful properties, functional components, and carriers. The third one concerned the motives for purchasing functional food and included the consequences and values. In the fourth section the participants were asked about gender, age, and education. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Gender, age, and education differentiated the criteria influencing the decision to purchase functional food. Women, older people (35-60 years), and those with university education attach the greatest importance to naturalness, nutritional value, freshness, food safety, and quality guarantee. Clear differences between men and women appear in the field of functional components, which are significantly more important for women than for men. Gender, age, and education essentially differentiate the preferences for base product (carrier). Young men prefer meat products in the role of functional carriers. In turn, women and older men prefer cereal products as basic functional carriers. Young consumers are more open to high-technology food processing. Motivations are differentiated by age and gender. Young men, as opposed to women and older men, attach less importance to functional and psychological consequences: improvement of health, healthy eating, conscious choice, and health promotion. Women and older men are more interested in health safety and are more responsible for their health. Among young men, lower self-esteem can be found. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The analysis conducted revealed that groups of consumers are significantly different from each other in the evaluation of the significance of each of the variables in the selection of functional food.

Females in academia with the female mentors have a decreased likelihood of promotion: Results from a network analysis of academic generalists,Chaiyachati K.H.; ; Liao J.M.; Weissman G.E.; Hubbard R.; Morgan A.U.; Buehler A.; Shea J.A.; Armstrong K.,"BACKGROUND: While mentorship is critical for academic careers, the association between academic promotion and mentorship attributes is poorly understood. Moreover, we hypothesized that mentor attributes may affect the known gender disparities in promotion. We used network analysis methods to explore the relationship between mentorship and promotion among academic generalists trained in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Through online searches and contacting programs, we identified graduates of generalist-oriented fellowships (e.g., general medicine, RWJ Clinical Scholars Program) between 2002-2007. We manually extracted PubMed publication data and electronically surveyed graduates to obtain information about grants, academic rank, and their top 10 most influential career mentors at the 5-year mark post-fellowship. With respondent mentees and nominated mentors represented as vertices, and mentor relationships as edges, we constructed a generalist community graph and generated 2 network measures: percent of common gender dyads (i.e., gender concordant menteementor pairs) and mentor centrality (i.e., how connected a mentor is to other network mentees). Using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for respondent and training institution characteristics, we evaluated the impact of common gender dyads, mentor centrality, and the interaction between the two on promotion to associate professor or higher, 5 years post-fellowship. We also calculated ""gender assortativity"" for the community graph, a composite measure of mentee preference for the same gender mentors [range: -1 (pref. for opposite-gender) to 1 (pref. for same-gender)]. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In total, 162 graduates representing 19 institutions completed our survey (51% response rate). Among the 136 who remained in academia 5 years post-fellowship, the majority were female (65%) and white (67%). At the 5-year mark, respondents reported a median of 3 mentors (IQR 3-5) and 10 peer reviewed publications (IQR 4-18). Thirty-nine percent reported < $500 K in grants and 13% achieved associate professor or higher. In multivariable analysis, neither gender nor percent of common gender dyads independently predicted promotion. However, the association between common gender dyad and promotion differed formen and women respondents with an odds ratio (OR) of 8.61 for men and 0.06 for women (interaction term p-value = 0.03). Other significant associations with promotion included mentor centrality, publications, and grant dollars. The assortativity of the mentorship graph was 0.11 (p < 0.001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): We identified facets of mentorship that may affect early career promotion. While more work is needed, we found the relationship between promotion and common gender dyads varied by gender-female mentees are less likely to be promoted with more female mentorship compared to males mentees with more male mentorship. Educators should consider mentorship disparities to help generalists, irrespective of gender, achieve academic promotion.",2017,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,32,2 Supplement 1,S192EP  - S193,615582377,,,#883,Chaiyachati 2017,"",""

The impact of self-esteem on career advancement among women and underrepresented minorities in academic medicine,Manne-Goehler J.M.; ; Freund K.; Raj A.; Kaplan S.E.; Terrin N.; Breeze J.L.; Carr P.,"BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to advance gender equality among physicians, differential career outcomes by gender persist in academic medicine. One factor unexplored as a reason for gender differences in career outcomes is the impact of self-esteem on physician outcomes. This is the first study to quantify the impact of self-esteem on subsequent key metrics of career achievement in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The National Faculty Study (NFS) is a longitudinal survey of career outcomes among female and male faculty, across the United States. The first National Faculty Survey was conducted in 1995 among a stratified random sample of 1814 faculty members, over sampling among women and minority faculty, at 24 medical schools. In 2012-13, we conducted a longitudinal follow-up among the sub-sample willing to participate in follow up studies. In the original survey, self-esteem was measured by the 4 item Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which was normalized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1.0 for these analyses. The follow up survey inquired about four major domains of career achievement: 1) number of peer-reviewed publications as a measure academic productivity, 2) academic rank of full Professor, 3) senior leadership including dean and department chair and 4) retention in an academic career. For non-respondents to the follow up survey, we supplemented our database from publically available sources. We assessed the impact of self-esteem in 1995 on career outcomes in 2012-13 in bivariate analyses, and then in multivariate regression models. We utilized logistic regression for all analyses except that of refereed publications, for which a negative binomial model was utilized. All multivariate models included gender and race/ethnicity (dichotomized as white versus minority, both underrepresented and non-underrepresented), and used backward selection for the following additional potential covariates: specialty, effort distribution across domains of teaching, clinical, research and administration, and years since first appointment. Because we hypothesized that gender differences in outcomes may be related to self- esteem, we repeated the analyses with interaction terms between gender and self-esteem. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The analytic sample was 1235, of whom 50 % were women and 71%were white. The mean self-esteem score in 1995 was significantly lower for women (-.119) than men (+.118, p < .0001). In unadjusted models, higher self-esteem in 1995 was positively associated with attaining the rank of Professor (odds ratio (OR) 1.36; 95 % confidence interval (CI, 1.20, 1.55), senior leadership (OR 1.28; CI 1.09, 1.50), number of peer-reviewed publications (OR 1.17; CI 1.10, 1.25), and retention (OR 1.29; CI 1.11, 1.50) in academic medicine. In multivariate regression models, female gender and minority race / ethnicity were negatively associated with all outcomes. In the multivariate models adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity, self-esteem retained its independent positive association with rank (OR 1.22; CI 1.05, 1.55), leadership (OR 1.22; CI 1.04, 1.43), refereed publications (RR 1.11; CI 1.04, 1.18), and retention (OR 1.31; CI 1.12, 1.53). There were no significant interactions between gender and self- esteem for any of the career outcomes. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Women reported lower self-esteem as compared to men in 1995. While higher self-esteem had a positive association with subsequent outcomes of retention, referred publications, rank and leadership, there was no confounding of this association by gender or race/ ethnicity and there was no significant interaction between selfesteem and gender. This indicates that the impact of self-esteem on career advancement was similar for women and men and for majority and underrepresented minority faculty, even though membership in these groups was associated with decreased odds of career advancement as measured by the metrics above. While self-esteem appears to be important for career advancement, it does not explain gaps in career advancement for women or minority faculty.",2016,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,31,2 SUPPL. 1,S424EP  - S425,72288753,,,#885,Manne-Goehler 2016,"",""
"Gender matters: Assessing disparities and promoting equity through improved resident communication, leadership, and negotiation",Mustapha M.; ; Rogers E.A.; Duffy B.; Gladding S.,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Gender disparities persist in academic medicine across leadership roles, promotion, and pay. Women comprise about half of US medical students, still academic medical centers have yet to close the gender gap that exists in associate and full professor ranks. Multiple studies have documented persistent gender disparities in academia: across senior level positions, promotion decisions, and salaries. Studies suggest that women who participate in leadership development curricula are more likely than their peers to attain deanships, department chairmanships, or full professorship. Despite these well documented needs, medical residents are rarely targeted for early interventions. To meet this need, we developed a resident curriculum addressing the interplay between gender and communication, leadership and negotiation. The overall curricular objective is to provide career development support to residents and promote career satisfaction and equity. By sharing our work, we hope attendees will be able to: 1) Recognize the need to address the influence of gender in GME 2) Perform an assessment for gender disparities amongst their own learners 3) Identify resources for building and delivering a curriculum to address needs SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents in Internal Medicine (90), Med-Peds (40) and Med-Derm (10) at the University of Minnesota (UMN). The curriculum is delivered during mandatory educational conferences and optional conferences. DESCRIPTION: In a needs assessment conducted among UMN medicine-pediatrics residents in spring 2015 (26 respondents of 39 total residents, 16 female), males more often than females reported positive experiences in communicating with ancillary staff (p = 0.02), and females more often than males had negative experiences in communicating with both consulting services and ancillary staff (p = 0.03 for each). There was a trend toward a difference in leadership, with males more often feeling their gender positively influenced opportunities for leadership and their teams' response to their own leadership style (p = 0.1). Overall, males felt their gender more positively affected their work experience (p = 0.001). From this assessment, we found that the male vs female difference was strongest for communication and leadership. Based on these data and literature review, we have developed and are implementing a resident curriculum that addresses the interplay between gender and communication, leadership, and negotiation. Our overall objective is to provide career development support to residents with a goal of promoting career satisfaction and equity. Our curriculum is innovative in two key ways: 1) designed specifically for residents instead of practicing physicians; 2) delivered to all residents-male and female- for broadening gender discussions, instead of many existing programs exclusively delivered to women. The curriculum includes interactive seminars in communication, leadership, and negotiation, focusing on knowledge acquisition, skill development, self-reflection and goal setting. Communication sessions focus on: different historical gender-based communication styles; strengths and weaknesses of these styles; and how clinical communication is affected by gender-based expectations. During leadership sessions, all residents complete a personality/skills assessment (StrengthsQuestTM) followed by an interactive ""debriefing"" on their individual results., Participants then create their own learning goals to implement during their next clinical rotations. In follow-up, senior residents attend an interactive workshop focused on different leadership styles to discuss their own experiences in leading a medicine team since their first leadership assessment. EVALUATION: The pilot phase of our curriculum focuses on the first two levels of Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model-measuring Reaction (how trainees react to the training) through individual post-session evaluations, and measuring Learning (how trainee knowledge has increased) through a pre-post curriculum knowledge assessment. Future assessments will study longer term learner outcomes. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Our needs assessment surprised us in a few ways. Though we expected gender disparities in communication and leadership, we were surprised that our small sample would reflect this so clearly. Additionally, several residents wrote about a lack of female role models, though the educational leadership in Medicine, Pediatrics, and Med-Peds is dominated by women. Male trainees also acknowledged disparate treatment based on gender and difficulty reconciling how to approach this disparity. The needs assessment data focused us on the topics of communication and leadership, but also clarified that the curriculum needed to include all genders, and it needed to include specific skill building and culture change. Initial seminar attendees have discussed intrinsic biases, ways in which both men and women can become victim to stereotype, and ways that individuals and groups can mitigate these disparities.",2016,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,31,2 SUPPL. 1,S821EP  - S822,72289520,,,#886,Mustapha 2016,"",""
"Letter to the Editor in response to ""publication performance of women compared to men in German cardiology"" by Boehm et al.

(2014) report better success of female vs male cardiologists publishing in journals with an impact factor >=5. However, only 25% of conference abstracts were submitted by women, perhaps suggesting a paucity of women in academic cardiology. In this 'letter to the editor' we review gender statistics in the medical field using Germany and the US as examples. While women are well represented in early career stages, only fewfull professors are women. This reflects a wasted opportunity to benefit from the best of both genders. Recent gender research has shown that subtle gender bias may play a role. To change the gender statistics in academic medicine a multifaceted approach is necessary. This will ultimately lead to a more equal representation of women in senior roles, and bring science, medical care, and leadership to a new level.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2015,/,International Journal of Cardiology,182,"(Weismann) Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, LLCI 302, New Haven, CT, United States(Colson, Shapiro) Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, United States",227EP  - 228,603871797,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.12.077,,#892,Weismann 2015,"",""
Mentoring in general surgery in Switzerland,Kaderli R.M.; ; Klasen J.M.; Businger A.P.,"BACKGROUND: Mentorship has been found as a key factor for a successful and satisfying career in academic medicine and surgery. The present study was conducted to describe the current situation of mentoring in the surgical community in Switzerland and to evaluate sex differences regarding the impact of mentoring on career success and professional satisfaction., METHODS: The study was designed as an anonymous national survey to all members of the Swiss Surgical Society in 2011 (820 ordinary and 49 junior members). It was a 25-item questionnaire addressing mentor-mentee relationships and their impact on the professional front., RESULTS: Of the 869 mailed surveys, 512 responses were received (response rate: 58.9%). Mentor-mentee relationships were reported by 344 respondents (68.1%) and structured mentoring programs were noted in 23 respondents (6.7%). Compared to individuals without mentors, male mentees exhibited significantly higher subjective career advancement (5.4+/-1.2 vs. 5.0+/-1.3; p=0.03) and career development (3.3+/-1.9 vs. 2.5+/-1.7; p<0.01) scores, but the differences for female mentees were not statistically significant (4.7+/-1.1 vs. 4.3+/-1.2, p=0.16; 2.5+/-1.6 vs. 1.9+/-1.4, p=0.26; respectively). The pursuit of an academic career was not influenced by the presence of a mentor-mentee relationship for female (p=0.14) or male participants (p=0.22)., CONCLUSIONS: Mentor-mentee relationships are important for the career advancement of male surgeons. The reason for the lack of an impact on the careers of female surgeons is difficult to ascertain. However, mentoring also provides lifelong learning and personal development.

"Gender differences in research productivity, academic rank, and career duration among U.S. Academic gastroenterology faculty",Enestvedt B.; ; Diamond S.; Thomas C.; Desai S.; Jagsi R.; Schmitt C.,"Introduction: Female representation in academic medicine is increasing without a proportional rise in the representation of women at senior academic ranks. Research productivity is a critical component of academic promotion. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): We hypothesize that male academic gastroenterologists have higher publication productivity and achieve higher rank than their female counterparts. We aimed to describe the gender representation in academic gastroenterology (GI), and compare publication productivity, academic rank, and career duration between male and female gastroenterologists. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Of 161 ACGME-accredited GI training programs in the U.S., we examined all faculty at 114 academic programs (affiliated with a University hospital or medical school). All data was collected from publicly available websites. Number of publications, H-index (a measure combining publication number and scholarly impact of an author's publications), career duration, and m-index (H index corrected for career duration) were recorded. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 2,486 academic faculty members evaluated, 1,894 (76%) are men and 592 (24%) are women. Fifty percent (50%) of men hold a senior faculty position (full or associate professor) compared to 29% of women (p< 0.001). Male faculty have longer career duration (median 20 years vs. 8 years for female, p<0.001), more publications (median 24 (range 0-949) vs. 9 (0-438); p< 0.001) and significantly higher H-indices, (8 vs. 4 (p <0.001)) than female faculty. Higher H index correlated with higher academic rank in both men and women (p<0.001). No difference was found in the H index between men and women faculty at the same rank for professor, associate professor and instructor (Figure 1). There was no difference in the m-index between men and women (0.5 vs. 0.46 respectively; p=0.214). These trends in the H index and m index were found in all regions of the country. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A gender gap exists in the number and proportion of women in academic GI, however after correcting for career duration, the productivity metrics of women faculty are equal to those of male gastroenterologists. Furthermore, women holding senior faculty positions are equally productive as their male counterparts.

Subspecialty Selection Impacts Research Productivity and Faculty Rank of Academic Orthopaedic Surgeons.,Haimowitz S; Veliky J; Forrester LA; Ippolito J; Beebe K; Chu A,"BACKGROUND: Faculty promotion and research productivity are important for the overall career trajectory of academic orthopaedic surgeons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role that subspecialty and demographic factors play in research productivity and academic advancement among orthopaedic surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of academic rank among orthopaedic surgeons in 2018. We identified academic orthopaedic programs in the United States from the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) and collected publicly available data for surgeons, including fellowship training, gender, faculty rank, geographic region, and years since residency, from institutional websites. Research productivity was defined with the Hirsch index (h-index) from Scopus, and the m-index was calculated from the surgeon's h-index and the date of the first publication. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the variables that are associated with associate professorship, full professorship, and the h-index. RESULTS: In this study, we identified and included 2,879 academic orthopaedic surgeons. Completion of a fellowship in foot and ankle (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.45 [1.17 to 5.15]), sports medicine (2.15 [1.12 to 4.15]), trauma (2.83 [1.42 to 5.66]), hand and upper extremity (2.20 [1.13 to 4.28]), musculoskeletal oncology (3.28 [1.49 to 7.21]), or upper-extremity reconstruction (3.20 [1.31 to 7.81]) was associated with associate professorship. Completion of a trauma fellowship was associated with full professorship (2.93 [1.27 to 6.77]). Completion of a fellowship in adult reconstruction (difference in least-squares means [95% confidence interval]: 5.01 [1.22 to 8.81]), sports medicine (4.52 [1.00 to 8.04]), spine (5.40 [1.63 to 9.18]), or upper-extremity reconstruction (10.64 [6.15 to 15.12]) or the completion of multiple fellowships (5.12 [1.27 to 8.94]) were independently associated with a higher h-index. Women had significantly lower h-indices than men at the assistant (median [interquartile range]: 3 [1 to 6] versus 4 [2 to 8]) and full professor (17 [12 to 26] versus 22 [13 to 34]) levels. There were no differences in the m-index between men and women at any academic rank. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic subspecialty selection is independently associated with research productivity and academic rank. The differences in research productivity may be important to consider when evaluating orthopaedic surgeons for promotion.

Diversity in Academic Laryngology: An Evaluation of Academic Advancement and Research Productivity.,Kollu T; Giutashvili T; Uppal P; Ruffner R; Mortensen M,"BACKGROUND: Diversity within the medical profession with respect to sex and racial minorities has been shown to have a positive effect on health and healthcare. Characterization of a field is key to evaluating trends and the advancement of diversity in an otolaryngology subspecialty. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: A comprehensive list of all the academic laryngologists was compiled from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited otolaryngology residency programs in 2020. The last 20 past presidents of the American Laryngological Association (ALA) and American Broncho-Esophogological Association (ABEA) were analyzed. Academic rank and years in practice were determined from departmental websites, with online search tools used as secondary resources. The h-index was utilized as a measure of research productivity. Regression analysis was performed to analyze these variables. RESULTS: There are 184 academic laryngologists in the 124 programs. The majority of the population is Caucasian 76.6% (141/184), followed by Asian 16.3% (30/184), African American 4.34% (8/184), and then Hispanic 1% (2/184). There are 47 full professors with 83% Caucasian, 14.1% Asian, and 2.1% African American and 91.5% male and only 8.5% female. Past ALA presidents were 90% male and for the ABEA 75% male.

Using the Rank Equity Index to measure emergency medicine faculty rank progression.,Hobgood C; Fassiotto M,"BACKGROUND: Faculty diversity is a high-priority goal for academic emergency medicine (EM). Most administrators currently monitor faculty diversity using aggregate data, which may obscure underrepresentation by rank. We apply the Rank Equity Index (REI) to EM faculty data to assess rank progression. METHODS: We calculated the REI (% faculty cohort higher rank/% faculty cohort lower rank) for EM faculty. We performed REI analyses by faculty gender (women, men) and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian). We compared professor/assistant professor, professor/associate professor, and associate professor/assistant professor to establish rank parity for gender and race/ethnicity. Parity is an REI of 1.0. RESULTS: REI analysis by gender demonstrates that women faculty did not achieve parity at any rank comparison in any study year. REI analysis by race/ethnicity demonstrates that all faculty of color are below parity at the assistant to associate professor promotion. Latinx faculty are at parity for associate professor to professor, but Asian and Black faculty do not achieve parity in any comparison. Intersecting gender and race/ethnicity in the REI analysis demonstrates that Asian women have the lowest REIs among all faculty ranks and races/ethnicities. Men of all races/ethnicities achieved parity in two of three rank comparisons, except for Black men, who did not achieve parity in any comparison. CONCLUSIONS: REI analysis demonstrates EM women faculty and faculty of color are not achieving rank parity and are disadvantaged at the first tier of promotion. A preliminary longitudinal trend analysis suggests little progress. Asian women and Black men experience the most rank inequity. REI analysis identifies a need for focused faculty development to enhance our most vulnerable faculty's rank progression, suggesting that targeted recruitment and retention efforts of women faculty of all races/ethnicities and faculty of color, in particular, will improve diversity at every tier of faculty rank.",2021,Sep,Acad Emerg Med,28,9,966-973,,10.1111/acem.14268,33909327,#911,Hobgood 2021,"",""

Advancement of prognostic models in breast cancer: a narrative review.,Min N; Wei Y; Zheng Y; Li X,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a reference for clinical work and guide the decision-making of healthcare providers and end-users, we systematically reviewed the development, validation and classification of classical prognostic models for breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from breast cancer have different prognosis for its high heterogeneity. Accurate prognosis prediction and risk stratification for breast cancer are crucial for individualized treatment. There is a lack of systematic summary of breast cancer prognostic models. METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search with keywords ""breast neoplasm"", ""prognostic model"", ""recurrence"" and ""metastasis"", and screened the retrieved publications at three levels: title, abstract and full text.

CONCLUSIONS: Combining prognostic-related variables with long-term clinical outcomes, researchers have developed a series of prognostic models based on clinicopathological parameters, genomic assays, and medical figures. The discrimination, calibration, overall performance, and clinical usefulness were validated by internal and/or external verifications. Clinicopathological models integrated the clinical parameters, including tumor size, histological grade, lymph node status, hormone receptor status to provide prognostic information for patients and doctors. Gene-expression assays deeply revealed the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer, some of which have been cited by AJCC and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.

Gender-based Barriers to the Advancement of Women in Academic Emergency Medicine: A Multi-Institutional Survey Study.,Graham EM; Ferrel MN; Wells KM; Egan DJ; MacVane CZ; Gisondi MA; Burns BD; Madsen TE; Fix ML,"INTRODUCTION: Leadership positions occupied by women within academic emergency medicine have remained stagnant despite increasing numbers of women with faculty appointments. We distributed a multi-institutional survey to women faculty and residents to evaluate categorical characteristics contributing to success and differences between the two groups. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved electronic survey was distributed to women faculty and residents at eight institutions and were completed anonymously. We created survey questions to assess multiple categories: determination; resiliency; career support and obstacles; career aspiration; and gender discrimination. Most questions used a Likert five-point scale. Responses for each question and category were averaged and deemed significant if the average was greater than or equal to 4 in the affirmative, or less than or equal to 2 in the negative. We calculated proportions for binary questions. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 55.23% (95/172). The faculty response rate was 54.1% (59/109) and residents' response rate was 57.1% (36/63). Significant levels of resiliency were reported, with a mean score of 4.02. Childbearing and rearing were not significant barriers overall but were more commonly reported as barriers for faculty over residents (P <0.001). Obstacles reported included a lack of confidence during work-related negotiations and insufficient research experience. Notably, 68.4% (65/95) of respondents experienced gender discrimination and 9.5% (9/95) reported at least one encounter of sexual assault by a colleague or supervisor during their career.

Promotion and Tenure Policies and Practices at U.S. Medical Schools: Is Tenure Irrelevant or More Relevant Than Ever?,Mallon WT; Cox N,"Promotion and tenure (P&T) have been common mechanisms to support and nurture faculty at higher education institutions and, therefore, have been of continual interest to medical school faculty and administrators. In the last decade, significant changes in the academic medicine sector have occurred, including new medical schools, mergers and acquisitions of academic hospitals and health systems, and institutional and societal efforts to address systemic racism and inequality. In addition, societal controversies have revived long-dormant concerns about academic freedom for medical school faculty, a bedrock principle of U.S. higher education for more than a century. These developments raise the question of whether tenure at medical schools is increasingly irrelevant for large numbers of full-time faculty or more relevant than ever.Using a 2022 survey of 118 medical schools, a review of P&T policies at 37 other medical schools, and an analysis of Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster data, the authors review the prevalence of tenure systems at U.S. MD-granting medical schools; trends in the use of such systems for full-time basic science and clinical faculty; models of including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) criteria in P&T standards; and alterations to introduce greater flexibility into the P&T process.The authors' analysis shows that, although tenure systems remain well established at U.S. MD-granting medical schools, the percentage of full-time faculty on tenured or tenure-eligible tracks declined over the last 4 decades. Troubling gaps in tenure-eligible appointments persist between men and women faculty and among faculty by race and ethnicity. Medical schools have begun to deploy a variety of tactics in P&T processes focused on DEI to address these systemic inequities.

Compensation and advancement of women in academic medicine: is there equity?,Ash AS; Carr PL; Goldstein R; Friedman RH,"BACKGROUND: Women have been entering academic medicine in numbers at least equal to their male colleagues for several decades. Most studies have found that women do not advance in academic rank as fast as men and that their salaries are not as great. These studies, however, have typically not had the data to examine equity, that is, do women receive similar rewards for similar achievement? OBJECTIVE: To examine equity in promotion and salary for female versus male medical school faculty nationally. DESIGN: Mailed survey questionnaire. SETTING: 24 randomly selected medical schools in the contiguous United States. PARTICIPANTS: 1814 full-time U.S. medical school faculty in 1995-1996, stratified by sex, specialty, and graduation cohort. MEASUREMENTS: Promotion and compensation of academic medical faculty. RESULTS: Among the 1814 faculty respondents (response rate, 60%), female faculty were less likely to be full professors than were men with similar professional roles and achievement. For example, 66% of men but only 47% of women (P < 0.01) with 15 to 19 years of seniority were full professors. Large deficits in rank for senior faculty women were confirmed in logistic models that accounted for a wide range of other professional characteristics and achievements, including total career publications, years of seniority, hours worked per week, department type, minority status, medical versus nonmedical final degree, and school. Similar multivariable modeling also confirmed gender inequity in compensation. Although base salaries of nonphysician faculty are gender comparable, female physician faculty have a noticeable deficit (-11,691 dollars; P = 0.01). Furthermore, both physician and nonphysician women with greater seniority have larger salary deficits (-485 dollars per year of seniority; P = 0.01). LIMITATIONS: This is a cross-sectional study of a longitudinal phenomenon. No data are available for faculty who are no longer working full-time in academic medicine, and all data are self-reported.

Prior studies have largely focused on individual-level solutions. To identify systems-based interventions, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) formed the Research Equity Task Force in 2018 with members from multiple academies (the Academy of Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine [AACEM], the Academy of Academic Administrators in Emergency Medicine [AAAEM], the Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine [AWAEM], and the Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine [ADIEM]) and sought recommendations from EM departmental leaders. METHODS: The task force conducted interviews containing both open-ended narrative and closed-ended questions in multiple phases. Phase 1 included a convenience sample of chairs of EM departments across the United States, and phase 2 included vice-chairs and other faculty who lead promotion and advancement. The task force identified common themes from the interviews and then developed three-tiered sets of recommendations (minimal, target, and aspirational) based on participant responses. In phase 3, iterative feedback was collected and implemented on these recommendations from study participants and chairs participating in a national AACEM webinar. RESULTS: In findings from 53 interviews of chairs, vice-chairs, and faculty leaders from across the United States, we noted heterogeneity in the faculty development and promotion processes across institutions. Four main themes were identified from the interviews: the need for a directed, structured promotion process; provision of structured mentorship; clarity on requirements for promotion within tracks; and transparency in salary structure. Recommendations were developed to address gaps in structured mentorship and equitable promotion and compensation. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations for AEM departments have the potential to increase structured mentorship programs, improve equity in promotion and advancement, and reduce disparities in the AEM workforce.

Career advancement for women faculty in a U.S. school of medicine: perceived needs.,McGuire LK; Bergen MR; Polan ML,"PURPOSE: The percentage of women faculty at the professor level has remained at approximately 11%. The medical community could benefit from knowing what is required to attract, retain, and advance women in the academy. METHOD: The Committee on Women in Medicine and Science at Stanford University School of Medicine was charged with improving career success and well-being of women faculty. In 2001-02, a survey instrument including both needs and perceived school climate was sent to 309 women faculty. Responses were analyzed using one-way analyses of variance with Tukey follow-up tests. RESULTS: A total of 163 (53%) faculty responded. The highest ranked needs were a flexible work environment without negative consequences for women with young children (mean = 4.37 on a five-point scale); a three-month sabbatical from clinical and administrative duties (mean = 4.15); departmental mentoring for academic career development (mean = 4.13); and school/departmental administrative secretarial support for grant and manuscript preparation (mean = 4.11). Climate data obtained in 2002, compared to data from similar surveys in 1994 and 1995, showed a nonsignificant decrease in mean ratings for sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and gender insensitivity in the intervening years. Mean ratings for positive climate and cohesion increased between 1994 and 1995 but remained stable from 1995 to 2002. Results of the survey were presented to the dean, faculty, and staff of the medical school. CONCLUSION: Women faculty members were able to clearly indicate specific interventions that would improve their career success and sense of well-being. Since administrators are committed to serious consideration of these recommendations, this was a key step in advancing women's careers in academic medicine at Stanford.",2004,Apr,Acad Med,79,4,319-25,,10.1097/00001888-200404000-00007,15044163,#957,McGuire 2004,"",""
Can the Language of Tenure Criteria Influence Women's Academic Advancement?,Marchant A; Bhattacharya A; Carnes M,"BACKGROUND: Women are not advancing to leadership positions in academic medicine at rates predicted by their representation in medical school over the past 20 years. The prejudice persists, often as an unconscious mental model, that leaders should be men. We examined whether the presence of the word ""leader"" in written tenure criteria may have a differential impact on promotion of men and women in elite medical schools. METHODS: We used a retrospective, descriptive design to study 24 academic medical centers top-ranked in both NIH funding and Carnegie classification. The main outcome measure was the slope of regression fit to 7-year annual data on percent faculty who are tenured women (1998-2004) relative to the median slope of all 24 institutions. RESULTS: Medical schools with the word ""leader"" in tenure criteria were more likely to have slopes below the median slope than schools without the word ""leader"" (OR = 6.0; CI = 1.02, 35.37; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Being a leader is associated with stereotypic male-gendered traits. Achieving tenure is a key gatekeeping point in advancement toward leadership in academic medicine.

"Gender differences in academic advancement: patterns, causes, and potential solutions in one US College of Medicine.",Wright AL; Schwindt LA; Bassford TL; Reyna VF; Shisslak CM; St Germain PA; Reed KL,"PURPOSE: The influx of women into academic medicine has not been accompanied by equality for male and female faculty. Women earn less than men in comparable positions, progress more slowly through academic ranks, and have not attained important leadership roles. This study tested hypotheses about why gender disparities exist in salary, rank, track, leadership, and perceptions of campus climate at one academic center, the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson. METHOD: Salary, rank, and track data were obtained from institutional databases for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. A structured, online questionnaire was made available to 418 faculty members to collect information about their goals, attitudes, and experiences. RESULTS: A total of 198 faculty members completed the questionnaire. The data showed significant gender differences in faculty salaries, ranks, tracks, leadership positions, resources, and perceptions of academic climate. On average, women earned US dollars 12777 or 11% less than men, after adjusting for rank, track, degree, specialty, years in rank, and administrative positions (p <.0003). Of female faculty, 62% were assistant professors (49% of women were non-tenure-eligible assistant professors), while 55% of male faculty were promoted and tenured. Almost a third of women reported being discriminated against, compared with only 5% of men (p <.00001).

"Women and the Decision to Leave, Linger, or Lean In: Predictors of Intent to Leave and Aspirations to Leadership and Advancement in Academic Medicine.",Ellinas EH; Fouad N; Byars-Winston A,"BACKGROUND: The Association of American Medical Colleges reports continued low rates of female faculty as professors and in leadership positions. While attrition and discrimination have both been proposed as explanations, recent literature has suggested that women's professional motivations, ingrained behavior, and perceptions of organizational support may also play a role. METHODS: The authors employed a series of scales informed by the turnover theory (which predicts intent to leave an organization), previously validated and used in business and engineering studies, but rarely used in academic medicine. The authors proposed and tested a multiple regression model to assess predictors (role strain, work-life balance, and organizational climate) for three outcome variables: seeking promotion, seeking leadership, and intent to leave. RESULTS: Survey results from 614 faculty members indicated that gender significantly influenced both promotion and leadership seeking, but not intent to leave. Perceived work-family conflict was negatively correlated with leadership seeking for women, but not for men. Positive views of organizational support and commitment were associated with promotion seeking and persistence for all participants. Role strain was positively correlated with desire for promotion and leadership, as well as with intent to leave. CONCLUSIONS: Female faculty may not be leaning in to promotion and leadership roles because of increased role conflict, work-life concerns, and organizational factors; this seems to be more of a factor for female clinical rather than research faculty. Work-family conflict affects male and female faculty differently and should be addressed in efforts to retain faculty and to remove barriers for female faculty seeking leadership opportunities.",2018,Mar,J Womens Health (Larchmt),27,3,324-332,,10.1089/jwh.2017.6457,29048981,#967,Ellinas 2018,"",""
The Female Global Scholars Program: A mixed-methods evaluation of a novel intervention to promote the retention and advancement of women in global health research.,Cordeiro AA; Walsh KF; Sundararajan R; Reif LK; McNairy M; Mathad J; Downs JA; Fahme SA,"Fewer than 25% of global health leadership positions worldwide are held by women, adversely impacting women's health and widening gendered health disparities. The Female Global Scholars (FGS) Program, established in 2018 at Weill Cornell Medicine, is a two-year hybrid training and peer-mentorship program that promotes the retention and advancement of early-career female investigators conducting health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the FGS Program on individual career advancement, academic productivity, and research self-efficacy. This mixed-methods study followed an explanatory sequential design. Participants completed an electronic survey collecting information on demographics, academic milestones, and research skill competency. Survey data were descriptively analyzed using R (Version 1.4.1106). In-depth interviews explored perceptions of the impact of the FGS Program on career development. The authors independently reviewed and thematically analyzed de-identified transcripts using NVivo (Version 13). In June 2022, twelve participants completed the survey. The median age was 40 years; 90% carried an MD, PhD, or other post-graduate degree. Since joining the FGS Program, respondents achieved a combined total of eight awarded grants, five academic promotions, 12 oral scientific presentations and 35 first-author peer-reviewed publications.

Stanford Network for Advancement and Promotion: The impact of a community building-focused leadership development program on the success of underrepresented groups in academic medicine.,Fassiotto M; Jerome B; Stefanac L; Oaiya O; Quihuis G; Maldonado Y; Harris O,"BACKGROUND: Leadership can be an isolating experience and leaders from underrepresented groups (URGs) may experience even greater isolation and vulnerability because of lack of representation. Given the collaborative nature of medicine, leadership programs for physicians need to address isolation. Social support is one mechanism to combat this isolation; however, most leadership programs focus exclusively on skills building. PURPOSE: The Stanford Network for Advancement and Promotion (SNAP) program was developed to reduce isolation among physician leaders from URGs in academic medicine leadership by building a supportive network of peers. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Ten women physicians from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds were invited to participate in SNAP. Annual surveys were administered to participants to assess the effectiveness of SNAP on decreasing feelings of isolation and increasing professional leadership growth. The authors charted the expansion and adaptation of the program model across gender and in additional settings. RESULTS: SNAP effectively created a sense of community among the physician leaders. Participants also reported feeling challenged by the program and that they had grown in terms of critical thinking, organizational knowledge, and empowerment as leaders. Participants found community building to be the most valuable program component. Because of this success, the SNAP model has been adapted to create 10 additional cohorts.

DESIGN/SETTING: The authors analyzed responses to a 55-part questionnaire sent to all full-time general internal medicine faculty at the major teaching hospitals in the United States. Unadjusted means were generated for men versus women faculty in demographics, training background, hours of work, professional time allocations, institutional support, professional self-assessment, research performance, academic rank, and compensation. Means were recalculated after adjusting for other variables using multivariate methods. RESULTS: The authors found no significant difference in the frequency of fellowship training between men and women faculty. Women and men perform similar professional activities, but even after multivariate adjustment, women devote less time to research and perceive less research skill and institutional support for their research, but have similar numbers of grants, abstracts, and publications in refereed journals and have similar academic ranks. Women faculty, however, receive lower compensation than do men faculty, even after adjustment.

The present study was aimed at the evaluation of the health promotion status in specialized hospitals associated with Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). METHODS: This applied study was conducted in two Hamadan specialized hospitals in the Hamadan city. The health promotion status was evaluated using a self-assessment checklist designed by the World Health Organization's HPH. The evaluation was done in five standards including management policy, patient assessment, patient information and intervention, promotion of a healthy workplace and continuity and cooperation. RESULTS: The results showed that both the hospitals studied had a poor status in terms of promoting a healthy workplace (average = 31.24%) and management policy standards (average = 35.29%) in comparison with the other relevant standards: patient assessment (53.12%), patient information and intervention (62.5%), continuity and cooperation (65.78%)). The results of the standards and sub-standards status displayed better performance in the cardiovascular hospital (53.67%) compared to the women and parturition hospital (42.64%). CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that HPH standards are very low in the studied hospitals.

Multivariate models were used to relate academic rank and salary to 16 independent variables. RESULTS: Significantly fewer women than men achieved the rank of associate professor or higher. For both men and women, higher salaries and ranks were related to greater academic productivity (more publications and grants), more hours worked, more institutional support of research, greater overall career satisfaction, and fewer career problems. Less time spent in teaching and patient care was related to greater academic productivity for both sexes.

Research indicates that until a critical mass of women with sustained success as leaders is achieved, it is unlikely that this deficit will be corrected. METHODS: To promote the attainment of a critical mass of women leaders, the authors integrate two approaches to advancing women--the concept of a leadership continuum and a framework of practical approaches for moving toward gender equity at all ranks. RESULTS: An institutional guide is presented that can be used to promote dialogue about gender equity, noting areas of success and opportunities for additional improvement as well as an assessment of progress.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multiple variables from cephalometry and SVF including the length of the soft palate, retropalatal space, retrolingual space, and mouth opening angle were evaluated during sleep events with or without the MAD between success and nonsuccess group. RESULTS: The soft palate was significantly longer in the nonsuccess group than in the success group. The retropalatal and retrolingual airway spaces and mouth opening angle were not different between 2 groups. Application of the MAD increased the retrolingual space and decreased the length of the soft palate and the mouth opening angle significantly in both success and nonsuccess groups. However, retropalatal space was widened only in the success group, which showed that retropalatal space may be important in determining treatment response of the MAD.
