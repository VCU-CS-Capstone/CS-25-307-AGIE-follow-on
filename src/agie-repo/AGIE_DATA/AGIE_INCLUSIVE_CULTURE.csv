Lesbian and Heterosexual Women’s Implicit Responses to Gender Figures,"da Silva, José Cláudio Rodrigues; de Almeida, Rodrigo Vianna; Bortoloti, Renato","This study explored how heterosexual and lesbian women differ in their implicit sexual responses. Previous research indicates that heterosexual women have physiological and implicit responses to both genders, whereas lesbian women show stronger responses to their preferred gender. This study used two implicit measures: the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Function Acquisition Speed Test (FAST), both of which were novel in this context. We recruited 33 heterosexual and 25 lesbian women. Both IRAP and FAST were successful in differentiating the two sexual orientations as a group. The results confirmed that heterosexual women exhibit positive responses to both genders, while lesbian women show stronger, category-specific responses to their preferred gender. These findings align with previous research and provide further insight into the nuanced differences in sexual orientation responses among women.",2024,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,53,10,3925-3943,3132729344,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-024-02972-9,,#1,daSilva 2024,"",""
Assessing the impact of climate change on reproductive health: A content analysis of climate journalism coverage,"Yuvaraj, Bharath R; Masilamani, Vaageessan; Saravanan, M; Karthikeyan, Harie; Moses, Fenn; Abraham; Kumar, Ravi P; Manjula, K","This research explores the intricate relationship between climate change and reproductive health through an analysis of 1000 global news articles from 2018 onwards.

"Implicit Gender Role Theory, Gender System Justification, and Voting Behavior: A Mixed-Method Study","Stanziani, Marissa; Cox, Jennifer; MacNeil, Elizabeth; Carden, Keisha","IntroductionGender roles are pervasive and impact all areas of modern society. Implicit gender role theory is one perspective on understanding individual perceptions of gender roles and how these perceptions influence behavior. This mixed-method study explored the association between implicit gender role ideology and support for “gendered legislation” (i.e., legislation with the potential to differentially impact individuals depending on their gender identity).MethodsQuantitative data (N = 558) collected from 2017 to 2018 demonstrate the association between implicit gender role ideology and six different pieces of gendered legislation. Participant individual interviews (N = 20), collected from 2017 to 2018, allowed for a more comprehensive and nuanced exploration of individual gender role attitudes and perceptions of two specific bills.ResultsIndividuals who believe gender roles are fixed and immutable are more likely to justify a patriarchal gender system and support legislation that differentially impacts individuals due to gender identity. Males are also more likely to identify with masculine traits and feel that their gender is central to their identity, while females are more likely to shed femininity in favor of agency to gain power and respect. Finally, qualitative themes highlight a general lack of nuanced understanding regarding gender roles, gender identity, sex, and sexual orientation.ConclusionMales and individuals who believe gender roles are fixed were more likely to justify a patriarchal gender system. Males, particularly those who believed gender roles are fixed, were also more likely to identify their gender as central to their identity.Policy ImplicationsRegardless of political orientation, gender role attitudes and participant sex may influence the ways in which people perpetuate or challenge the patriarchal gender system. Thus, perpetuation of the current gender system, or moving toward gender equality, may stem from interventions at the individual level.",2024,,Sexuality Research & Social Policy,21,3,1151-1170,3084984983,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-024-00966-9,,#3,Stanziani 2024,"",""
The Role of Feminism and Gender in Endorsement of Hookup Culture among Emerging Adults,"Martino, Rachel M.; Roberts, Savannah R.; Maheux, Anne J.; Stout, Claire D.; Choukas-Bradley, Sophia","Hookup culture has transformed the sexual behavior of emerging adults. Feminism, a movement that has advocated for liberating women from sexual repression, may be associated with hookup endorsement attitudes. This study explores the associations among multiple dimensions of feminism, gender, and hookup culture endorsement. Participants included 318 emerging adults (46% women; Mage = 22.2 years; 51% White, 27% Asian, 5% Hispanic/Latinx, 9% Black, 1% Middle Eastern, 1% American Indian, 6% Multiracial) from five Anglophone countries (62% U.S., 23% United Kingdom, 9% Canada, 5% Australia, 1% New Zealand), who completed the Feminist Beliefs and Behavior Scale and Endorsement of Hookup Culture Index via an anonymous, online survey. Participants were categorized according to their feminist identity label (feminist, non-feminist) and feminist belief system (hold feminist beliefs, hold non-feminist beliefs). A series of ANCOVAs was conducted, revealing that women who identified as feminist and/or held feminist beliefs reported significantly higher endorsement of hookup culture compared to non-feminist women with non-feminist beliefs. Neither dimension of feminism predicted hookup culture endorsement in men. When comparing feminist-identifying women and men, the gender disparity in hookup culture endorsement was eliminated. Together, these findings highlight how social movements, such as feminism, may be associated with young women’s attitudes towards hookups, and may ultimately shape their sexual experiences.",2024,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,53,5,1621-1632,3056953517,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-024-02841-5,,#4,Martino 2024,"",""
Essential Aspects of Gender-inclusive Computer Science Education,"SäLivin, Lisa; Öberg, Lena-Maria; Mozelius, Peter","Computer science is a higher education domain that still show a significant male dominance. Many research studies have highlighted the importance of diversity and gender balance in computer science related areas such as software engineering and system development. However, there is still a well-identified problem that university programmes and courses on computer science fail to attract the female audience. The objective of this study is to investigate the concept of gender-inclusive computer science (CS) education with the aim of broadening participation in CS courses and programs. This is conducted through a literature study, initially focusing on keywords and research areas, and subsequently searching into existing research. The research question that guided the study was: ""What concepts can be found in literature to make computer science education more gender-inclusive?"". Data were analysed thematically in a two-step analysis process inspired by the grounded theory methods of Open coding and Axial coding. Findings suggest that there is significant room for learning in this field, particularly from Critical CS education studies. The Open coding analysis showed that the findings can be categorised into eight main themes. In the Axial coding the themes were merged, refined, renamed, and centred around the main axial theme of 'Epistemological pluralism'. Other essential themes that all are related to the axial main theme were: 'Design and creativity', 'Bias awareness and ethics', 'Collaboration and communication', 'Self-regulated learning', 'Real-world applications', and 'Role models and mentorship'. The result of this study is presented through a visual model that illustrates essential aspects of inclusive computer science education. The paper also proposes various directions for future research.",2024,,International Conference on Gender Research,,,339-346,3082337761,,,#5,SäLivin 2024,"",""
Gender as a Moderator of the Double Bias of Mistakes: Knowledge Culture and Sharing Effects,"Kucharska, Wioleta; Kopytko, Aleksandra","There is no learning without mistakes. The essence of the double bias of mistakes is the contradiction between an often-declared positive attitude towards learning from mistakes, and negative experiences when mistakes occur. Financial and personal consequences, shame, and blame force desperate employees to hide their mistakes. These adverse outcomes are doubled in organizations by the common belief that managers never make mistakes, which makes the contradiction even more harmful. Double bias affected leaders select only easy tasks to secure their positions, and those who want to be promoted hide their mistakes to maintain the image of a ""perfect employee"". Avoiding the risk of failure is generally not wrong as long as doing so does not block organizational growth. It has been proven that the double bias of mistakes can present a serious hurdle for organizational learning and collective intelligence building. This study explores whether the double bias of mistakes is gender-related and how it affects tacit and explicit knowledge sharing. To do so, it is based on a sample of 183 Polish knowledge workers affected by the double bias of mistakes. The analysis method was ordinary least squares regression, which was conducted with SPSS PROCESS software. Results show that the double bias of mistakes generally causes more problems for female specialists than male specialists and more for male managers than female managers. Regarding managers, male managers probably tend to focus more on control at work. In contrast, women focus on supporting learning (they accept mistakes as a source of knowledge and share knowledge gained from them). Considering current challenges relating to collective intelligence building, women seem to have the potential to be better mentors and probably also better leaders than men. Such formulated conclusions are based on indirect inferences, so further research is necessary.",2024,,International Conference on Gender Research,,,190-199,3082337696,,,#6,Kucharska 2024,"",""
Co-creating Inclusive Intersectional Democratic Spaces across Europe (CCINDLE): Counteracting Anti-gender through Feminist Knowledge,"Lombardo, Emanuela; Caravantes, Paloma","The construction of feminist democratic societal projects relies on the production of feminist knowledge and ideas within social movements, as well as academic, professional, and institutional settings.

"‘You don’t like this blood? Well, too bad!’ Alternative cultures of menstruation and the performativity of disgust",Guilló-Arakistain Miren,"This article explores the ‘performativity of disgust’ as a feminist strategy that takes place in various instances of menstrual activism. The analysis is based on an ethnographic study in Spain, which focused on alternative politics and cultures of menstruation that question the negative hegemonic Western vision of menstruation. By analysing the debates around gender, feminism, and corporality that arise in this field, the article highlights alternative corporal and menstrual imaginaries. The article contributes to and extends critical menstruation studies by exploring how feminist activists who engage in menstrual politics produce an aesthetic of disgust by reappropriating the abject, and in so doing, question the politics of menstrual disgust and gender inequalities. Paying special attention to collective initiatives that take place in public space, viewed as a place of social transformation, the article sheds light on how challenging the notion that ‘menstruation is disgusting’ can help us question gender and social inequalities, and promote social transformation.",2024,,The European Journal of Women's Studies,31,1,104-120,3015092316,https://doi.org/10.1177/13505068241238909,,#8,Guilló-ArakistainMiren 2024,"",""

Predicting risk of the subsequent early pregnancy loss in women with recurrent pregnancy loss based on preconception data,"Yang, Xin; Wang, Ruifang; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Yanting; Wang, Fang","BackgroundFor women who have experienced recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), it is crucial not only to treat them but also to evaluate the risk of recurrence. The study aimed to develop a risk predictive model to predict the subsequent early pregnancy loss (EPL) in women with RPL based on preconception data.MethodsA prospective, dynamic population cohort study was carried out at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. From September 2019 to December 2022, a total of 1050 non-pregnant women with RPL were participated. By December 2023, 605 women had subsequent pregnancy outcomes and were randomly divided into training and validation group by 3:1 ratio. In the training group, univariable screening was performed on RPL patients with subsequent EPL outcome. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic regression were utilized to select variables, respectively. Subsequent EPL prediction model was constructed using generalize linear model (GLM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and deep learning (DP). The variables selected by LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression were then established and compared using the best prediction model. The AUC, calibration curve, and decision curve (DCA) were performed to assess the prediction performances of the best model. The best model was validated using the validation group. Finally, a nomogram was established based on the best predictive features.ResultsIn the training group, the GBM model achieved the best performance with the highest AUC (0.805). The AUC between the variables screened by the LASSO regression (16-variables) and logistic regression (9-variables) models showed no significant difference (AUC: 0.805 vs. 0.777, P = 0.1498). Meanwhile, the 9-variable model displayed a well discrimination performance in the validation group, with an AUC value of 0.781 (95%CI 0.702, 0.843). The DCA showed the model performed well and was feasible for making beneficial clinical decisions. Calibration curves revealed the goodness of fit between the predicted values by the model and the actual values, the Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 7.427, and P = 0.505.ConclusionsPredicting subsequent EPL in RPL patients using the GBM model has important clinical implications.

Do Virtual Environments Close the Gender Gap in Participation in Question-and-Answer Sessions at Academic Conferences?

This gap in participation in scientific discourse may perpetuate the status quo. The current research examines whether this gender gap in participation in Q&A sessions extends to virtual conferences, which have become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to shifts in conference formats to enable asynchronous, anonymous, and/or simultaneous participation, we examined whether virtual conferences are more inclusive, and mitigate the gender gap in Q&A participation. Across four virtual conferences that varied in gender representation and Q&A structured format, men continued to take a disproportionate amount of time and space in Q&A sessions. Disproportionate participation did not significantly vary between in-person and virtual formats and did not systematically vary by how the Q&A session was organized. In an all-chat virtual conference, gender differences in volubility were attenuated among higher status academics.

Care and Constraints in the Climate Crisis: An Intersectional Rhetorical Analysis of News Comments about the El Dorado Fire,"Bloomfield, Emma Frances; Rice, Rebecca M","In September 2020, a gender reveal party started the El Dorado Fire in southern California. We analyzed comments on news coverage of the fire from two outlets with different political leanings to evaluate how the rhetorical process of assigning guilt is influenced by interlocking systems of power, making an intersectional lens useful for analyzing responses to environmental crises. Some comments evoked scapegoat ecology, which is a response to guilt that narrows the scope of climate change to the igniters of the wildfire. Other comments evoked what we call ecological transcendence, which replaces scapegoating with attention to systems-level concerns. In analyzing ecological transcendence, we outline differences between collective action mobilized by inclusive care and seemingly unifying discourses of selective care that foster marginalization and oppression.

"A Culture of Consent: Legal Practitioners’ Experiences of Representing Women Who Have Been Misidentified as Predominant Aggressors on Family Violence Intervention Orders in Victoria, Australia","Reeves, Ellen","There is currently unprecedented attention in Australia on the misidentification of women victim-survivors as family violence ‘predominant aggressors’—this focus has largely been oriented towards the role of the police. Less research has considered court responses to misidentification and specifically, the role that legal practitioners play in recognising and responding to clients who have been misidentified. This article addresses this key gap in the literature through an exploration of 18 legal practitioners’ experiences of representing misidentified clients in the civil protection order system in the Australian state of Victoria. The findings suggest that legal practitioners face a number of challenges when representing clients who have been misidentified and that the magistrates’ courts are ill-equipped to respond to misidentification.

Women (n = 281) and men (n = 300) enrolled in advanced degree programs in the United States completed implicit (session 1) and explicit (session 2) measures of work and parent identity strength. Women identified more strongly with the parent role on the implicit measure, but with the career role on the explicit measure. The degree to which their identities shifted across measures predicted how much conflict they anticipated in navigating parent and professional roles. Anticipated conflict in turn predicted poorer outcomes on an aggregate measure of health and well-being and accounted for (mediated) the gender difference on this outcome. Having a mother who worked, and perceiving greater equality in gender roles, were associated with lower levels of expected role-conflict for women students.

Don’t Be My Neighbor: Exploring Social and Value Predictors of Sexual Prejudice Expressed by Those Who Fully Accept Sexual Minorities,"Davoudpour, Shahin","It is without a doubt that acceptance of sexual minorities is growing across the globe. Two major narratives are commonly assumed to be true about this increased acceptance. First, this acceptance is increased by proximity to the stigmatized. Second, this acceptance is enduring. These might not be entirely true as multiple attitudinal datasets frequently show a diversity among the accepting population, especially for those who express full acceptance of the stigmatized while refusing neighboring proximity to them. This inconsistency in acceptance is the main focus of this study. Using rejection of neighboring proximity to sexual minorities as a case for stigma and data from the Integrated Values Surveys (n = 52,796; 48.15% male), this study explores the similarities and differences between those who fully accept sexual minorities and those who express heightened sexual prejudice when rejecting neighboring proximity to sexual minorities. Logistic regression models show those in the accepting population who reject neighboring proximity to sexual minorities are more likely to be men, lower educated, highly religious, hold a traditional gender-related belief, and are attracted to right-wing political ideologies. While those with extreme sexual prejudice share sex, age, and traditional gender-related beliefs in rejecting neighboring proximity to sexual minorities, no effects for educational attainment and political ideology were discovered.

"How to Ensure Inclusivity in Large-Scale General Population Cohort Studies?

M.","Despite recent advances in the measurement of sex, gender, and sexual orientation in large-scale cohort studies, the three concepts are still gaining relatively little attention, may be mistakenly equated, or non-informatively operationalized. The resulting imprecise or lacking information hereon in studies is problematic, as sex, gender, and sexual orientation are important health-related factors. Omission of these concepts from general population cohort studies might dismiss participants’ identity and experiences and pushes research on sexual or gender minority populations toward purposive sampling, potentially introducing selection bias. It also reinforces the unintentional notion of irrelevance of these concepts to health research, ultimately disadvantaging sexual and gender minority populations. Similarly, a lack of uniform measures on sex, gender, and sexual orientation hampers multi-cohort studies in which data from multiple studies are combined, facilitating increased statistical power. This paper discusses the encountered pitfalls and lessons learned on including and assessing sex, gender, and sexual orientation in large-scale general population cohort studies, exemplified by the Dutch Lifelines Cohort Study.

When patients feel stigmatized, they are more likely to delay seeking help and it affects patient cooperation and compliance, thus undermining therapeutic efficacy itself. We examined knowledge and attitude toward LGBT+ people among Hungarian (n = 743) and foreign (n = 130) medical students of the four Hungarian medical universities and 188 students from other faculties. Homonegativity and inadequate knowledge about sexual minority individuals are correlated with male gender, conservative political views, religiosity, religious behavior, and the absence of LGBT+ acquaintance. Medical students show more negative attitudes than students from other disciplines, although foreign medical students were more accepting than Hungarian program students. Further investigation of sexual minority-related content of the Hungarian medical education and revising the written and hidden curriculum would be desired, as well as collecting data from postgraduate students, physicians, and wide range of university faculties.",2023,,Journal of Homosexuality,70,7,1386-1410,2800400876,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2030615,,#20,Török 2023,"",""
Bollywood as a Site of Resistance: Women and Agency in Indian Popular Culture,"Yadav, Sheetal; Jha, Smita","This article evaluates the contemporary Indian redefinition of gender norms, subjectivity, and practices by analyzing Bollywood films as a major influence upon its global audiences. This study explores how Indian cinema redefines women's status and promotes gender-neutral entertainment by harnessing the powerful energies of current movements such as #MeToo. The article closely examines the textual and conceptual features of current women-focused movies like Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga (2019), Thappad (2020), and Paglait (2021). This examination focuses on key insights from popular Bollywood actresses' critical feminist roles to understand their assertions of women's power, agency, and equality. Additionally, this research explores the evolving trope of the male liberator, who dominated past Bollywood and the popular culture imagination but is now being revised in a way that deconstructs patriarchal norms. This paper first explores traditional portrayals of women in Bollywood and then critiques these films to look at how resistance is portrayed in contemporary cinema.

The tweets went viral, receiving international news coverage. The public attack by the task force director runs contrary to Harvard’s stated academic freedom principles, yet no disciplinary action was taken, nor did any university administrators publicly support my right to express my views in an environment free of harassment. Unfortunately, what happened to me is not unusual, and an increasing number of scholars face restrictions imposed by formal sanctions or the creation of hostile work environments.

The Cancer of Cancel Culture: Spreading “Correct” Scientific Ideologies Across North American Academia,"Pfaus, James G.","The spread of “cancel culture” related to sex and gender controversies in North America is examined as part of a larger movement to politicize sex research findings and certain sex and gender narratives as “correct” and “incorrect” from a so-called social justice standpoint. This binary is then used by academic administrators and empowered individuals or self-interest groups to reward or punish scholars for their viewpoints. The cases described by Meyer-Bahlburg, Lowrey, and Hooven are concrete examples of a growing “sexual McCarthyism” where empirical results are challenged by offended social justice “warriors” and embellished on social media into ad hominem attacks, to the point that it can damage—or even cancel—the careers of productive sexual scientists. This occurs largely out of fear on the part of academic administrators and lawyers charged with protecting the university from “brand damage” that might occur if the offending scholar is not dealt with. Sexual scientists are being vilified for research on sex differences, sex/gender assignment and subsequent causes for transitioning and/or de-transitioning, research that shows few or no untoward social or psychological effects of viewing pornography, research that debunks the notion of porn or sex “addiction,” research showing the efficacy of medications to treat sexual desire disorders in women, research on “minor attracted persons” and even animal research that dares to show homologies to human sexual behavior.

Review of Health Insurance Policy Inclusivity of Gender Nonconforming and Nonbinary Individuals Seeking Gender-Affirming Health Care,"Bond, Stephanie M; Fouche, Tom; Smith, Jesse R; Garza, Rebecca M","Background: An increasing number of individuals who present to health care professionals identify as transgender, gender nonconforming (GNC), and gender nonbinary (NB). GNC/NB individuals experience higher rates of discrimination in health care settings compared with their binary (e.g., trans male and trans female) counterparts. Outdated language excludes the nuances of gender identity. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether current terminology found in health insurance policies may be a barrier to gender-affirming health care for GNC/NB individuals.Methods: Health insurance policies for a diverse subset of government (n=4) and private (n=6) payers were obtained in May 2020. Policies were reviewed independently by two members of the research team to determine whether each was supportive or unsupportive to GNC/NB individuals. An arbitrary scoring system was designed that allowed the reviewers to assign a specific number of points to each policy based on the aggregation of mention, coverage, and inclusivity.Results: Most policies performed poorly as indicated by a support score less than zero. It was also noted that most policies used binary, gendered language, and terminology that excludes the unique gender identities of many GNC/NB individuals.Conclusions: Most policies currently failed to provide clear, inclusive coverage to GNC/NB individuals for relevant and important aspects of their care. In their current state, these policies are a source of confusion, uncertainty, and discouragement for these individuals, which can present as a barrier to accessing quality, inclusive, gender-affirming health care.",2022,,Transgender Health,7,6,484-496,2744917904,https://doi.org/10.1089/trgh.2020.0146,,#24,Bond 2022,"",""

Advanced Strategic Platform for Inclusive Research Environments (ASPIRE): A Tool for Change,"Pinho, Mariana; Colston, Belinda; Mitchell, Alison; Bayley, Julie; Salmon, Udeni","In recent years, organisations have been striving to adopt a proactive approach towards reducing discrimination and enhancing inclusion. Research performing organisations, in particular, have made substantial investments and adopted a number of policies, programmes and interventions to combat gender inequality. Despite the progress achieved, gender equality in research and higher education institutions deems to be particularly difficult to attain, with the same challenges remaining prevalent for decades. Among the contributors to the perpetuation of gender inequality in academia, is the inability of gender equality initiatives to challenge gendered norms. Partly because the focus of such initiatives remains on normative constructions of gender, and their implementation is based on the assumption of culture change through instrumental drivers. Consequently, as long as success and impact of equality initiatives remains solely associated with the introduction of new policies, rather than the transformation of entrenched behavioural and culturally-prescribed norms, significant, continuous and integrated change is unlikely to occur. To address these issues, the Advanced Strategic Platform for Inclusive Research Environments (ASPIRE) offers an innovative and evidence-based framework aimed at accelerating meaningful change in attitude and behaviour towards diversity and facilitating inclusive research environments. ASPIRE encourages the focus of enquiry to expand from the (re)production of inequalities and adoption of solutions that centre on improving staff statistics and performance metrics, to long-term interactive processes of change that can generate structural and embedded impact on organisational culture. ASPIRE provides a dynamic web-based platform for implementation, adoption and sustained Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) practice. It goes beyond the current EDI approaches by taking a holistic and intersectional perspective, that does not only address issues of gender, but accounts for other personal characteristics that contribute to unique experiences of discrimination. It appropriately guides and measures the implementation of EDI initiatives across institutions, linking such measurement with indicators of change in attitudes and culture, and providing recommendations for future and further action.",2022,,International Conference on Gender Research,,,"186-192,XIV",2681920867,,,#28,Pinho 2022,"",""
A “Chillier” Climate for Multiply Marginalized STEM Faculty Impedes Research Collaboration,"Griffith, Eric E; Mickey, Ethel L; Dasgupta Nilanjana","Research collaboration is key to faculty career success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Yet little research has considered how faculty from multiply marginalized identity groups experience collaboration compared to colleagues from majority groups. The present study fills that gap by examining similarities and differences in collaboration experiences of faculty across multiple marginalized groups, and the role of department climate in those experiences. A survey of STEM faculty at a large public research university found that faculty from underrepresented groups – in terms of gender, race, and sexual orientation – had more negative experiences with department-level research collaborations. Moreover, faculty with multiply marginalized identities had worse collaboration experiences than others with a single marginalized identity or none. They also perceived their department climate to be less inclusive, equitable, and transparent; and felt their opinions were less valued in their department than colleagues from majority groups. Negative department climate, in turn, mediated and predicted less hospitable experiences with department-level research collaborations. These data suggest that multiply marginalized faculty, across different identity groups, share some common experiences of a “chilly” department climate relative to their peers from majority groups that impede opportunities for scientific collaboration, a key ingredient for faculty success. These findings have policy implications for retention of diverse faculty in university STEM departments.",2022,,Sex Roles,86,3-4,233-248,2624601083,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-021-01259-w,,#29,Griffith 2022,"",""

We examined an existing—and often-used—contact intervention in pre-existing groups in an educational setting and assessed its effectiveness in reducing different forms of LGBT negativity. We focused particularly on modern LGBT negativity: a relatively subtle form of prejudice, involving ambivalence, denial, and/or the belief that there is too much attention for LGBT prejudice. We used a mixed design in which condition (experimental vs. control group) was the between-participants factor, which was randomized at the group level, and time (pretest vs. posttest vs. follow-up) was the within-participants factor (N = 117). Interventions were video recorded and the behavior of LGBT educators and participants was coded. Participants responded positively to the intervention, especially to the LGBT educator’s “coming-out story.” Exploratory analysis of the video data indicated that the perceived effectiveness of the intervention was higher in groups where participants were more engaged, although caution is necessary in interpreting this finding. The most important measure indicated that modern LGBT negativity decreased in the intervention groups directly after the intervention, but returned to baseline levels one week later. However, in the control condition, modern LGBT negativity had increased over time. Taken together, this suggests that an actual reduction in modern LGBT negativity was short-lived (i.e., the intervention effect disappeared within 7 days).",2021,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,50,7,3035-3051,2591866512,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02046-0,,#31,Cramwinckel 2021,"",""

Participants completed a survey on their experiences with gender discrimination, school connectedness, math and science achievement motivations, and the gender-science implicit association test. Results demonstrated that girls who experienced more gender discrimination reported lower levels of school connectedness.

Facilitating Gender Inclusivity in the Engineering Profession,"Baruah, Bidyut; Zhang, Yu","UK has one of the lowest percentages of female engineering professionals in Europe, representing only 24% of the total UK STEM workforce. The logistics show that women in technical roles have increased from merely 15.7% in 2009 to 16.4% in 2019.

Building an Inclusive Talent Pipeline: A Study on Women of the Indian Informational Technology Sector,"Alok, Swati; Banerjee, Sudatta; Khan, Mohammed A Rahman","Of the many women that are a part of the Informational Technology (IT) workforce, very few make it to senior roles. Occupational commitment measured as affective (AC), normative (NC), and continuance (CC) as well as career satisfaction (CS) are considered to be crucial in understanding this pattern of women not making it to senior roles. AC explains one's emotional attachment to their career, NC is the obligation to stay the course in a career, and CC explains the opportunity cost to transfer from one career to the next. This study aims to understand the role of individual determinants (career identity, career adaptability) and occupational culture fit (the concept of screening potential candidates that is focused on aligning employees and employers with shared values, beliefs, and attitudes). This study also focuses on forms of organizational support (managerial support, job autonomy) that either act as enablers or barriers to sustaining commitment and satisfaction in IT occupations. Data collected from 200 IT women with at least 5 years of experience working in top 20 NASCOM companies were regressed to test the hypotheses. The result indicated that women with high scores in occupational culture (i.e., greater congruence with IT occupational demands) show higher career satisfaction (CS), affective commitment (AC), and normative commitment (NC). This indicates that there is a chance for organizations to actively improve women's occupational demand of long, late, and erratic work schedules by looking at their safety and providing flexi-timing to help them manage a work-life balance. A performance evaluation system that focuses on results, rather than hours of effort, and that allows women flexibility to attend to certain late-night commitments at home could go a long way in helping them achieve a better culture fit. Women with strong career identities show higher AC and CC. Women that have high career identities are intrinsically motivated and place a high value on their work; hence, they continuously seek skill improvement opportunities. Employers can utilize this knowledge to proactively identify female employees with high career identities early in their professional journey then engage them in tasks that are meaningful and aligned with their interests and values. Further, results indicated that job autonomy-a person's ability to have an influence over what happens in their work environment, in particular, the ability to influence matters that are relevant to their personal goals-led to higher CC; higher managerial support leads to career satisfaction, thereby indicating that managers can provide support by providing a participative decision-making mechanism and flexible timing for better work-life balance.",2021,,"Journal of International Women's Studies, suppl.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate: (1) the rate of pregnant expectancy/planning of children; (2) whether the Chinese cultural influence of son preference still exists, and factors effecting sex preference; and (3) whether artificial reproductive technology plays a role in parents giving birth to a child of their preferred sex. We used the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study dataset at six-months, which included 21,248 babies born in 2005. More mothers than fathers reported this pregnancy as unexpected (29.0% vs. 20.5%).

However, among those who showed a preference, significantly more preferred sons than daughters (son preference, mothers: 24.8%, fathers: 24.3%; daughter preference, mothers: 22.5%, fathers: 19.9%). Additionally, structural equation modeling found that parents who had planned their pregnancy were more likely to prefer sons and less likely to prefer daughters. Parents who used artificial reproductive technology for conception were more likely to prefer and conceive sons.

It is not new even in African cultures. Christians in the Bible also talk about the Book of Proverbs to show that they have existed from time immemorial. They have the old wisdom of a group of traditional people. They derive from beliefs, attitudes, emotions, values and the whole system of thought and feeling. Although they contain truth about life in general and human nature in particular, some of them do not feature nowadays. In some cases, they discriminate against women whereas according to The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996), no one must be discriminated against. The Constitution of the South Africa (1996) identifies injustices of the past and put them right to satisfy everybody. Their use in daily conversations is slowly declining.

Women Leaders in Engineering: The Role of Career Orientation and Work Environment,"Schmitt, Miriam","The number of women holding management positions in engineering professions in Germany is very low. Gender stereotypes, male-dominated networks and hierarchical organizational structures make it difficult for women engineers to find access to higher management. Companies in engineering are therefore characterized by the division of their structures into male and female and are strongly 'gendered organizations' (Acker, 1990). In this paper, Schein's career anchor model (1975) is used to explore the career goals and interests that lead women engineers to strive for leadership positions. As the match between career orientation and work environment helps to reach positive career outcomes, organizational structures can enable, but also limit women to pursue their career goals. This leads to the following research questions: (1) what are the career orientations of women leaders in engineering and (2) how do the women's interests correspond to their work environment? For this purpose twelve qualitative expert interviews with women engineers in management positions in Germany were conducted. The content analysis of the interviews reveals that the women embody a combination of different career orientations. Hereby, the hierarchical career advancement is not the only goal for the women. They are more concerned with the desire for responsibility and participation, search for challenge, and compatibility of career and family. A highly intrinsic work motivation goes hand in hand with a subjective striving for career success, which finally leads to the attainment of leadership positions. While mechanical engineers are influenced by the organizational structures of their companies they work for, architects benefit from the flexibility of their self-employment. With regard to a gendersensitive organizational management these insights can be used to adapt women's individual needs to organizational structures and to make leadership positions in engineering more attractive for women.",2020,,International Conference on Gender Research,,,"220-227,XII",2398216909,https://doi.org/10.34190/IGR.20.025,,#45,Schmitt 2020,"",""
Sexual Attraction to Both Genders in Ambiphilic Men: Evidence from Implicit Cognitions,"Snowden, Robert J; Fitton, Ellen; McKinnon, Aimee; Gray, Nicola S","Ambiphilic (or bisexual) men describe feelings of sexual attraction to both men and women. However, physiological measures of arousal have failed to show a consistent pattern of arousal to both genders. We measured men’s automatic associations between the concept of sex (represented by words) and the concepts of men versus women (represented by images) via the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and a priming task. On the IAT, gynephilic men (N = 32) were faster for women-sex pairings, androphilic men (N = 18) were faster for men-sex pairings, while ambiphilic men (N = 20) showed no bias toward either gender. We then isolated the concepts of “men” and “women” by comparing them separately against neutral images. In contrast to both the gynephilic or androphilic men, ambiphilic men showed sexual associations to both men and women. On the priming task, ambiphilic men showed faster responses to sex words, but slower responses to not-sex words, when primed with pictures of either men or women compared to when primed by neutral images. The results from all the experimental tasks suggest that ambiphilic men have a pattern of sexual association that is different from both gynephilic and androphilic men and represents a sexual attraction to both men and women.",2020,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,49,2,503-515,2358230710,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-019-01552-6,,#47,Snowden 2020,"",""

Meeting to transgress: The role of faculty learning communities in shaping more inclusive organizational cultures,"KerryAnn O’Meara; Nyunt, Gudrun; Templeton, Lindsey; Kuvaeva, Alexandra","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the role faculty learning communities (FLCs), a common ADVANCE intervention, play in retention and advancement; and the ways in which FLC spaces foster professional interactions that are transformative and support the careers of women, underrepresented minority (URM) and non-tenure-track (NTT) faculty in research universities.Design/methodology/approachThe authors employed a mixed methods case study approach set at a large, research-intensive institution, which had received an NSF ADVANCE grant to focus on issues of gender equity in the retention and advancement of STEM faculty. Land Grant University implemented retention and advancement efforts campus-wide rather than only in STEM areas, including five FLCs for women, URM faculty and NTT faculty. The primary sources of data were retention and promotion data of all faculty at the institution (including the FLC participants) and participant observations of the five FLCs for five years.FindingsThe analysis of retention and advancement data showed that participation in FLCs positively impacted retention and promotion of participants. The analysis of participant observations allowed the authors to gain insights into what was happening in FLCs that differed from faculty’s experiences in home departments. The authors found that FLCs created third spaces that allowed individuals to face and transgress the most damaging aspects of organizational culture and dwell, at least for some time, in a space of different possibilities.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors suggest additional studies be conducted on FLCs and their success in improving retention and advancement among women, URM and NTT faculty. While the authors believe there is a clear professional growth and satisfaction benefit to FLCs regardless of their effect on retention and advancement, NSF and NIH programs focused on increasing the diversity of faculty need to know they are getting the return they seek on their investment and this line of research can provide such evidence as well as enhance the rigor of such programs by improving program elements.Practical implicationsFLCs offer higher education institutions a unique opportunity to critically reflect and understand organizational conditions that are not inclusive for groups of faculty. Professional interactions among colleagues are a critical place where academic and cultural capital is built and exchanged. The authors know from the authors’ own research here, and from much previous social science research that women, URM and NTT faculty often experience exclusionary and isolating professional interactions. FLCs should be created and maintained alongside other more structural and cultural interventions to improve equity for all faculty.Originality/valueThe study’s contribution to the literature is unique, as only a few studies have tracked the subsequent success of participants in mentoring or networking programs. Furthermore, the study reveals benefits of FLCs across different career stages, identity groups and position types (women, URM and NTT) and suggests the investment that many NSF-funded ADVANCE programs have made in funding FLCs has the potential to produce a positive return (e.g. more women and URM faculty retained).",2019,,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",38,3,286-304,2202722216,https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-09-2017-0184,,#49,KerryAnnO’Meara 2019,"",""

Effects of Interventions Addressing School Environments or Educational Assets on Adolescent Sexual Health: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Peterson, Amy J; Donze, Melissa; Allen, Elizabeth; Bonell, Chris","CONTEXT: School-based interventions that aim to modify sexual health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors have mixed and often unsustained effects on adolescent sexual health outcomes. However, observational evidence suggests that broader school-related factors, such as school climate and academic attainment, can influence outcomes. METHODS: Nine databases were searched in July 2017 for randomized and quasi-experimental evaluations of interventions addressing school-level environment or student-level educational assets, to examine whether such interventions can promote young people's sexual health. Searches were limited to studies published since 1990 but were not restricted by language. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and synthesized narratively and meta-analytically. RESULTS: Searches yielded 11 evaluations, published from 1999 to 2016, of interventions related to school-level environment or student-level educational assets. Because of inconsistent reporting, the risk of bias was not clear for most studies, and meta-analysis was possible for only one outcome. The meta-analysis of three randomized trials provided some evidence that school-environment interventions may delay sexual debut (pooled odds ratio, 0.5). Narrative synthesis of the remaining outcomes found mixed results, but suggests that interventions addressing school-level environment may delay sexual debut and that those addressing student-level educational assets may reduce risk of pregnancy and STDs.

Ideological Inequalities: Khmer Culture and Widows' Perception of Remarriage,"Lee, Susan Hagood","To explain the enduring persistence of gender inequality, structural explanations alone are not sufficient. One must look at the realm of cultural ideas to understand the entrenched nature of female subordination. Ideological inequalities embedded in cultural beliefs and practices sustain and perpetuate structural inequalities. This article explores ideological inequalities in Cambodian culture as an explanation for the reluctance of rural widows to remarry, despite the economic benefits that a new husband would likely bring. Using concepts from the theory of the social construction of reality, two cultural sources for widows' reluctance are considered, the beliefs and practices of Khmer Buddhism and the chbab srey, an influential moral code for women. The article theorizes that widows shy away from remarriage because Khmer religious and social customs place women into an ideologically subordinate position in the household. Widows fear that in a new marriage, they would lose control over their household and their children's lives. By remaining widows, they have cultural space to reject female subordination, maintain control of their household, and focus on their role as mothers to earn religious merit for their next life. Instead of ideological inequalities that subordinate women, modified cultural arrangements can create ideological equalities that nurture both men and women.",2018,,Journal of International Women's Studies,19,5,29-44,2057939534,,,#59,Lee 2018,"",""

"Training reproductive health professionals in a post-conflict environment: exploring medical, nursing, and midwifery education in Mogadishu, Somalia","Yalahow, Abdiasis; Hassan, Mariam; Foster, Angel M","Following two decades of civil war, Somalia recently entered the post-conflict rebuilding phase that has resulted in the rapid proliferation of higher education institutions. Given the high maternal mortality ratio, the federal government has identified the reproductive health education of health service professionals as a priority. Yet little is known about the coverage of contraception, abortion, pregnancy, childbirth, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in medicine, nursing, or midwifery. In 2016, we conducted a multi-methods study to understand the reproductive health education and training landscape and identify avenues by which development of the next generation of health service professionals could be improved. Our study comprised two components: interviews with 20 key informants and 7 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 48 physicians, nurses, midwives, and medical students. Using the transcripts, memos, and field notes, we employed a multi-phased approach to analyse our data for content and themes. Our findings show that reproductive health education for medical and nursing students is inconsistent and significant content gaps, particularly in abortion and SGBV, exist.

What is a True Gamer? The Male Gamer Stereotype and the Marginalization of Women in Video Game Culture,"Paaßen, Benjamin; Morgenroth, Thekla; Stratemeyer, Michelle","Women and men play video games in approximately equal numbers. Despite this similarity, video gaming is still strongly associated with men. A common justification for this stereotype is that, although women might play games, they should not be considered ""true"" or ""hard-core"" gamers because they play more casually and less skillfully compared to their male counterparts. In this contribution, we review the existing literature on gender and gaming to investigate the male gamer stereotype in terms of its accuracy, persistence, effects, and future perspective. We conclude that the stereotype varies in accuracy depending on the definition of ""gamer."" We further argue that the persistence of this stereotype can be explained by the fact that almost all professional and highly visible figures in gaming culture are male. On the other hand, female players who achieve a moderate level of competence are rendered invisible or are actively marginalized. We argue that the effects of the male gamer stereotype can be harmful to women, precluding them from the positive outcomes of video game play such as enhanced access to fields of science, technology, and engineering.",2017,,Sex Roles,76,7-8,421-435,1877731692,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y,,#66,Paaßen 2017,"",""

We conducted two studies to investigate whether family-supportive policies and/or culture influenced organizational attractiveness, whether gender differences exist, and three theoretically based reasons why they might exist: (a) women anticipating or experiencing greater work-to-family conflict, (b) women having stronger family values, and (c) women expecting to benefit more from family-supportive practices than do men. In Study 1, 195 undergraduate students rated their attraction to a firm using a 3 (Type of Policy: dependent care assistance, flexible work arrangements, control) x 3 (Work-Family Culture: supportive, unsupportive, control) x 2 (Participant Gender) between-subjects design. A supportive work-family culture was associated with higher ratings of organizational attractiveness than was an unsupportive culture, and the effect was stronger for women. The effect of culture on organizational attractiveness was partially mediated by anticipated work-family conflict, but this mediation did not explain gender differences. In Study 2, we surveyed 255 job-seeking and working adults about the importance of family-supportive policies and culture to job choice. Participants rated a family-supportive culture as more important than policies to job choice, and women valued culture more than did men. The gender difference was explained by women's stronger belief that they would benefit from a family-supportive culture rather than differences in values or work-family conflict.

Previous studies of fictional scientists have argued that women are often depicted as less scientifically capable than men, but these have largely taken a simple demographic approach or focused exclusively on female scientist characters. By examining both male and female scientists (n=222) depicted over the first 50 years of Doctor Who, our study shows that, although male scientists significantly outnumbered female scientists in all but the most recent decade, both genders have consistently been depicted as equally competent in scientific matters. However, an in-depth analysis of several characters depicted as extremely scientifically non-credible found that their behavior, appearance, and relations were universally marked by more subtle violations of gender expectations. Incompetent male scientists were largely depicted as effeminate and lacking in masculinity. In addition, many incompetent male and all incompetent female scientists served regimes that were problematically effeminate, collectivist and pacifist, or male-rejecting and ruled by women. Although Doctor Who avoids overtly treating women and men unequally, strong codes of masculine capability and prowess nevertheless continue to influence representations of scientific competence, pointing to the continued pervasiveness of such associations within wider Western culture. Professionals working to encourage gender-inclusive practices in science should look to subtle discourses about the masculine culture of science in addition to institutional and structural impediments to participation for women and gender minorities.",2016,,Sex Roles,75,3-4,79-94,1802427946,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0597-y,,#70,Orthia 2016,"",""

It was located beside El Cuartel General del Ejercito del Peru, aka El Pentagonito, which owes its name to its namesake, the Pentagon in Washington. This is the Lima that Ricardo Uceda, a Peruvian journalist, described in his book, Muerte en el Pentagonito: Los Cementerios Secretos del Ejercito Peruano (Death in the little Pentagon: The Secret Cemeteries of the Peruvian Army). In his book, Uceda documented the assassinations and incinerations that took place during the administrations of Alan Garcia (1985-1990) and Alberto Fujimori (1990-2001), many of which took place inside the Pentagonito, the Peruvian military headquarters. Since 1985, under the pretext of national security, the Peruvian army and police force have killed thousands of peasants, Indigenous people, students, and professors accused of being Shining Path or Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac Amaru (mrta) collaborators. According to Uceda, ""Basically, the modus operandi was the same: the arrest of people close to their home by agents of the army's intelligence service, detention in the Army Headquarters' basement (Pentagonito) and subsequent execution and incineration in the furnace that existed for that purpose in that military unit"" (cited in Godoy).

Overall, the self-affirmation intervention benefited some aspects of school-related adjustment for adolescents of immigrant and non-immigrant descent.

Building an Inclusive Pedagogy in Synchronous Online Learning Environments Focused on Social Justice Issues: A Case Study,"Schreder, Karen A.; Alonzo, Julie; McClure, Heather","In the spring of 2020, a global pandemic caused an immediate transition to online, synchronous learning platforms in much of the world. In discussion-based classrooms, where students construct learning from the material and their interactions with each other, the shift posed new challenges to educators and students. This mixed methods action research case study focused on the challenges and successes of teaching a university class about sensitive issues in the area of educational equity using a web-based platform. Over the course of two semesters, forty-eight pre-credential teacher education students were surveyed regarding their experiences taking part in equity-focused discussions over a synchronous Zoom platform. Semi-structured interviews with four instructors and five student volunteers were conducted to add depth to the survey data. A key finding is that Students of Color were significantly less comfortable discussing issues of race, gender, and equity with their cameras on than were White students. Additional findings pointed to race- and gender-based preferences in modes of engagement with the class material; the use of a multi-component pedagogy including anonymous discussion boards, chat posts, and group breakouts are suggested approaches for reaching all students when engaging an online class in discussions about race, gender, and sexuality.",2023,,International Journal of Technology in Education,6,1,1-18,2844758304; EJ1378689,,,#80,Schreder 2023,"",""
Inclusive Learning Environments Can Improve Student Learning and Motivational Beliefs,"Li, Yangqiuting; Singh, Chandralekha","We discuss an investigation of students' motivational beliefs and performance on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) in a calculus-based introductory physics course at a large public university in the U.S. We investigated how students' perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment (including perceived recognition, perceived effectiveness of peer interaction, and sense of belonging) predicts students' FCI scores and physics motivational beliefs (including self-efficacy, interest, and overall physics identity) at the end of the course after controlling for students' high school performance and their FCI scores and motivational beliefs at the beginning of the course. We find signatures of noninclusive learning environment in that female students' mean scores in physics motivational beliefs and perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment were lower than male students', and the gender gap in students'self-efficacy increased from the beginning to the end of the course. Using structural equation modeling, we find that the gender differences in students' motivational beliefs and FCI scores were mediated by the different components of students' perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment. In particular, students' perceived recognition, e.g., by instructors, was an important predictor of their overall physics identity, and their sense of belonging predicted their self-efficacy and FCI scores.

We analyzed institutional data to explore who participates in research and who does not. We also specifically sampled a group of students who expressed an interest in research experiences but who never actually participated for our student survey (N=96). Additionally, we conducted five focus groups with students, staff, and faculty (N[approximately]30). We found positive results in the analysis of patterns of participation and found no significant or substantial differences between students who did or did not participate in undergraduate research in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, or first-generation status. The undergraduate researcher population did have significantly more STEM majors and Pell grant recipients. The qualitative analysis identified barriers to participation in research in the following areas: access to research opportunities, programmatic structures, research culture and norms, and campus climate.

Queering Your Culture: The Importance of Gender Diversity and Inclusion in The Classroom,"Hennessy, Terri; Bloomberg, Sara","Forty-two percent of LGBT youth say the community in which they live is not accepting of LGBT people (Human Rights Campaign). That's 4 out of 10. And lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people are almost five times more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to have attempted suicide. It is very, very hard for an LGBTQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual) child to grow up in a society that tells them that who they are is wrong or ignores who they are or pretends that people like them don't exist. (And yes, this is true for all marginalized communities.) By making their school or classroom inclusive, educators have the very amazing power to change those numbers and the lives of the children they teach. Schools should be a safe space for people--students, families, teachers, staff--to feel comfortable being themselves. To do this, educators need to actively cultivate a culture that embraces and teaches gender diversity and inclusion. Teaching peace means teaching equity. It means having an anti-bias, anti-racist (ABAR) curriculum in place and a culture that supports educators' ABAR curriculum and models equity. In this article, Terri Hennessy and Sara Bloomberg discuss why educators need to break the gender binary and how and why it is important to communicate with parents/caregivers about what topics are being discussed in the classroom and what language is being used.

How to Foster the Formation of STEM Identity: Studying Diversity in an Authentic Learning Environment,"Singer, Alison; Montgomery, Georgina; Schmoll, Shannon","Background: STEM identity has been shown to have a powerful role in an individual's success in educational environments, as well as on their career goals and trajectories. Historically, however, STEM identity formation for underrepresented students has been hampered by the lack of representation of in STEM fields, which predominantly consist of white males. One educational challenge is diversifying STEM classrooms, both in terms of the students themselves and also in terms of the science and scientists they learn about. Methods: We piloted a 4-credit History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science course at Michigan State University. Students were tasked with creating exhibits focused on themes of diversity and inclusion in science for a real client. Using a STEM identity survey, we assessed students' attitudes towards the sciences, issues of diversity in science, and their sense of belonging to their educational communities. We also had the students respond to various short-answer questions throughout the semester to better understand their experiences working on a collaborative authentic learning task. Results: Our results suggest that authentic learning experiences based around ideas of diversity and inclusion can help students develop sense of belonging and positive STEM identities. Students demonstrated shifts in their self-identities as scientists, focusing more on the intersection between their gender, ethnicity, and self-perception as a scientist. Through qualitative analysis of short-answer questions, we were able to ascertain that working in groups in an authentic learning environment helped the students improve their communication and collaboration skills. Conclusions: Students' increased focus on gender and ethnicity suggests that they are thinking critically about how their personal identities intersect with their scientific identities. Additional research would help us better understand if the coupling of authentic learning and inclusive teaching practices have significant impacts on the formation of students' STEM identities.",2020,,International Journal of STEM Education,7,,,2488219505; EJ1273983,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-020-00254-z,,#85,Singer 2020,"",""

Diversity under the microscope: Lessons for building belonging in interdisciplinary spaces from the Women in Imaging + Industry bootcamp,"Esbin, Meagan; Blackmon, Lena","As scientific projects and labs benefit from increasingly interdisciplinary expertise, students and trainees find themselves navigating a myriad of academic spaces, each with its own workplace culture and demographics. A clear example is the interdisciplinary field of optics and biological microscopy which bridges biology, physics and engineering. While Biology PhDs are now >50% women, men in physics and engineering fields still significantly outnumber women, resulting in an imbalance of gender representation among microscopists and other ‘tool innovators’ in the interdisciplinary field of biological microscopy and biomedical optics. In addition to the cultural and cognitive whiplash that results from disparate representation between fields such as Biology, Engineering, and Physics, indifference from institutional leaders to implement equity-focused initiatives further contributes to cultures of exclusion, rather than belonging, for women. Here we elaborate on the motivation, structure, and outcomes of building a specific affinity-based bootcamp as an intervention to create an inclusive, welcoming learning environment for women in optics. Considering the presence of nonbinary, trans and other gender minoritised scientists, we recognise that women are not the only gender group underrepresented in biological microscopy and biomedical optics; still, we focus our attention on women in this specific intervention to improve gender parity in biological microscopy and biomedical optics. We hope that these strategies exemplify concrete paths forward for increasing belonging in interdisciplinary fields, a key step towards improving and diversifying graduate education. © 2023 Royal Microscopical Society.",2024,,Journal of Microscopy,295,1,6-13,,10.1111/jmi.13188,,#87,Esbin 2024,"",""

Engineering climate for marginalized groups: Connections to peer relations and engineering identity,"Davis, Susannah C.; Nolen, Susan Bobbitt; Cheon, Naeun; Moise, Elba; Hamilton, Eric William","Background: A better understanding of departmental climate and its relationship to engineering identity is needed to diversify engineering and improve marginalized students' experiences. Purpose/Hypothesis: We investigated whether undergraduate engineering students from 16 social identity groups perceived departmental climate differently from one another and examined psychological and behavioral factors contributing to these perceptions and their relationship to engineering identification. Design/Method: We surveyed 398 undergraduate engineering students about departmental climate and engineering identity, testing structural models across race and gender. Qualitative analysis of open-ended items complemented quantitative results. Results: Students rated climate for dominant identities (White, male, and/or US-born) as more welcoming than for 14 nondominant identities, broadening the notion of ""nondominant"" identities in engineering. In structural models, invariant across race and gender, students' perceptions of bias, safety, and faculty support predicted climate ratings; peer relations and microaggressions predicted engineering identity. There were mean differences in perceptions across intersections of race and gender, but students in all groups perceived a climate gap favoring dominant identities. Open-ended responses highlighted students' desire for a more diverse, inclusive program and the importance of peer relations. Conclusions: Departmental climate can be less welcoming for engineering students with many different nondominant identities. Attending to both students' own social positioning and their perceptions of climate for other students can open opportunities for change in engineering departments.

The results show that both female and male students' physics self-efficacy and interest decreased from physics 1 to physics 2, while there was no statistically significant change in students' perceived recognition and identity. We found signatures of an inequitable and noninclusive learning environment in that not only was there a gender difference in students' motivational beliefs disadvantaging women, but the gender difference in perceived recognition increased from physics 1 to physics 2. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the predictive relationships among students' motivational beliefs in physics 1 and physics 2. Analysis revealed that perceived recognition from others, e.g., instructors and teaching assistants, was the largest predictor of physics identity in both courses, and the role played by perceived recognition was even more important in physics 2 for predicting identity and mediating the gender difference in self-efficacy. Our findings suggest that perceived recognition is very important for the development of students' physics identity in both physics 1 and 2.

Investigating society’s educational debts due to racism and sexism in student attitudes about physics using quantitative critical race theory,"Nissen, J.M.; Many Horses, I.H.; Van Dusen, B.","The American Physical Society calls on its members to improve the diversity of physics by supporting an inclusive culture that encourages women and Black, Indigenous, and people of color to become physicists. In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students’ attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey.

However, contrary to the culturally responsive literature addressing approaches to ""colorblindness,"" engineering faculty believe they should treat all students equally. Purpose: This study explored conceptions of equity and privilege present within the culture of engineering education, particularly the White male population. Method: This longitudinal qualitative study investigated the experiences of one longtime engineering professor, an insider to the culture of engineering confronted with conceptions of his own privilege. We analyzed interview, focus group, and field note data to evaluate shifts in our participant's perspective while he was enrolled in a doctoral program that challenged his views of race, privilege, and equity. Results: Our participant was initially opposed to conceptions of his own privilege. Through repeated challenges to his beliefs about privilege coupled with reflections on his experiences and positioning in society, his beliefs shifted toward recognizing inequities based on class and race. Conclusions: In a discipline with an overrepresentation of White men, there can be resistance to addressing topics of equity and privilege.

In particular, we focus on the discourse of ability hierarchy-reflecting dominant values of sorting and ranking students based on perceived academic abilities-and the discourse of individual blame-reflecting dominant framings of educational problems as solely the responsibility of individual students or families. We aim to understand how these discourses surface in teachers' reasoning about teaching engineering.MethodWe interviewed 15 teachers enrolled in an online graduate program in engineering education. Utilizing critical discourse analysis, we analyzed how teachers drew on discourses of blame and ability hierarchy when reasoning about problems of practice in engineering.ResultsTeachers drew on engineering education concepts to reinforce dominant discourses (echoing specific language and preserving given roles) as well as to disrupt (utilizing different language or roles that [implicitly] challenge) dominant discourses. Importantly, teachers could also retool discourses of ability hierarchy (arguing for a more equitable distribution of resources but problematically preserving the values of ranking and sorting students).ConclusionsK-12 schooling's sociohistorical context can shape how teachers make sense of engineering in ways that implicate race, gender, disability, and language, suggesting a need to grapple with how discourses from schooling-and engineering culture-maintain marginalizing environments for students. © 2024 ASEE.",2024,/,Journal of Engineering Education,113,1,30-52,,10.1002/jee.20563,,#97,DeLucca 2024,"",""
Gendered patterns in the construction of physics identity from motivational factors,"Kalender, Z.Y.; Marshman, E.; Schunn, C.D.; Nokes-Malach, T.J.; Singh, C.","Students’ intentions to persevere and their career choices in science, technology, engineering, and math fields can be impacted by their physics identities.

Therefore, it is particularly difficult for women who do not fit the description of a stereotypical physicist to develop a physics identity. Thus, understanding the factors underlying physics identity in introductory physics classrooms is important for creating an equitable and inclusive physics learning environment and has the potential to at least partly explain the current underrepresentation of women in physics-related majors and careers. In this study, we examined physics identity and several other motivational constructs of male and female students by administering a survey in introductory calculus-based physics courses at a large research university.

Prior research suggests that the imbalances between science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields may be partly due to greater male interest in things and greater female interest in people, or to off-putting masculine cultures in some disciplines. To seek more detailed insights across all subjects, this article compares practising US male and female researchers between and within 285 narrow Scopus fields inside 26 broad fields from their first-authored articles published in 2017. The comparison is based on publishing fields and the words used in article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The results cannot be fully explained by the people/thing dimensions. Exceptions include greater female interest in veterinary science and cell biology and greater male interest in abstraction, patients, and power/control fields, such as politics and law. These may be due to other factors, such as the ability of a career to provide status or social impact or the availability of alternative careers. As a possible side effect of the partial people/thing relationship, females are more likely to use exploratory and qualitative methods and males are more likely to use quantitative methods.

Some of these actions are focused on increasing the representation of historically underrepresented groups and investing in creating a culture where all employees can reach their potential. Moreover, there are sectors in which the lack of inclusive environments is more critical. In particular, in the engineering and technology sectors, there is a lack of diversity related to gender and race. This problem is present in all worldwide regions, despite vary from one to another. Regarding the gender gap, governments and organizations put their efforts into reducing it in engineering and technology through actions mainly focused on engaging more women into these areas, avoiding dropping out during STEM studies, and joining the labor market. In this context, we have developed a project to mainstream gender within this framework and foster diversity in computer engineering studies. The project has two main objectives: prepare students to introduce diversity and inclusion as part of the software development processes; and build work environments that follow the principles of diversity and inclusion. In order to improve the actions related to both objectives, this study collects the perception of students regarding the gender gap in computer engineering studies to answer two questions: R1 What kind of support do computer engineering students have before starting their university studies?; R2 - Are there differences between the perception of the students in Brazil and Spain related to the social, academic, and professional context? The results show that almost half of the participants had not received any support before studying Computer Engineering. On the other hand, mothers are the principal support in both countries. Finally, the results show that Spanish participants have more awareness of the lack of women in the engineering and technological sector and the need to work on this issue. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

Welcome to engineering: Gender equality in learning and integration among first year students,"Torres, Manuel; Ferreira, Sara; Sousa, Armando; Moreira, Luciano; Torres, Raquel","The presented research explores four years of newcomer engineering students at FEUP, one of the largest faculties of engineering in Portugal. The students are surveyed in a mandatory course common to all engineering programs at the mentioned faculty, totalling an involvement of about four thousand. This research explores the perceptions of 1198 newcomer students regarding learning and satisfaction, workload, integration into academic work environment and institutional support whilst trying to find gender differences regarding the following variables: engineering program, academic year and change of residence. The questionnaire used in the presented research was validated and its internal consistency was excellent. The findings reveal that students' perceptions on learning and satisfaction as well as on institutional support (two out of four factors) are consistently similar between genders throughout the four years of the study. The differences found between male and female students on integration and workload, however consistent, are small if not marginal. The study is significant because it shows the relevance of the optimization efforts for integration (in the academic work environment) introduced in a mandatory course at the start of engineering degrees in order to bridge the gap between male and female students. This research shows that we are walking towards gender equality in engineering, but we feel that there is still some effort to be done, namely through inspiring scholars to analyse and act upon academic contexts and higher education governance without prejudice and with an open mind: a commitment that is as hard as necessary. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",2018,,International Journal of Engineering Education,34,1,45-55,,,,#104,Torres 2018,"",""
Teaching About Racial Equity in Introductory Physics Courses,"Daane, A.R.; Decker, S.R.; Sawtelle, V.","Even after you have decided to tackle a problem like racial equity, it may seem daunting to broach the subject in a physics classroom. After all, the idea of a (typically White) instructor in power tackling a sensitive topic such as social justice can be scary in any (mostly White) classroom. Not only that, but physics is typically viewed as a “culture with no culture.” The physicist’s quest for objectivity, along with a general focus on a fixed set of laws and formulae, support the treatment of this subject as untouched by people. Sometimes it is easier to ignore the problem and just focus on the Conservation of Energy Principle. However, ignoring the striking underrepresentation of ethnic/racial minorities and women in both the physics classroom and the field at large is a great disservice to all our students. We take the position that the persistence of representation disparities in physics is evidence that culture plays a role in who and what is involved in physics. Instructors have an opportunity to explicitly address the absence of equitable circumstances in classrooms and highlight the obstacles that contribute to the disparity (e.g., varied access to learning opportunities and support structures, dominant cultural norms, stereotype threat, implicit bias, hidden curricula, etc.). We acknowledge that incorporating these discussions in a physics classroom is fraught with difficulty, but we also believe that trying to lead these discussions is better than ignoring the problem. Furthermore, a set of resources for teachers interested in leading these discussions has been developing in the physics teacher community. Rifkin offers resources for leading a two-week unit on equity designed for secondary science classrooms. Here we describe another possible pathway for integrating a shorter equity unit into the traditional content of a (predominantly White) university physics classroom, addressing racial inequity and sharing common student responses that may arise.",2017,,Physics Teacher,55,6,328-33,,10.1119/1.4999724,,#105,Daane 2017,"",""

Male and female mental health differences in built environment undergraduates,"Scott-Young, Christina M.; Turner, Michelle; Holdsworth, Sarah","The construction industry faces skills shortages and growing mental health issues which have stimulated a research focus on the underrepresentation of female employees and on its tough macho-culture and stressful working conditions. Evidence of sex differences in construction workers’ mental health is starting to emerge, with women and younger workers experiencing the greatest levels of distress. This study takes an upstream perspective on construction human resources to explore sex differences in mental health and resilience in the early career pipeline of emerging built environment (BE) professionals. A survey of 384 BE undergraduates was conducted using the DASS-21 measure of mental health and the Resilience at University scale to explore the psychological adjustment of first and final year student cohorts. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and regression. Compared to first year students, female students’ mental health appeared to have deteriorated across the four-year degree, whereas, male students’ overall mental health improved. The results suggest that the construction classroom may be operating as a microcosm of the cultural environment faced by women in society in general and in the construction industry with its macho culture filtering back into the university sector. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to sex and gender differences in mental health. It is recommended that construction educators and employers partner together to proactively affect culture change by addressing gender bias early, by consciously creating a female-friendly, inclusive culture which emphasises a sense of belonging, and by providing gender-appropriate support systems and resilience training for emerging construction professionals. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,,Construction Management and Economics,38,9,789-806,,10.1080/01446193.2020.1748213,,#107,Scott-Young 2020,"",""
Analysis of Strategies to Attract Female Talent in the Software Development Industry,"Negrier-Seguel, M.; Hochstetter-Diez, J.; Dieguez-Rebolledo, M.; Caceres-Senn, M.; Cadena-Martinez, R.","Historically, activities related to software development have been led by men, with weak participation from women.

Examining measurement invariance of an ICT literacy self-efficacy scale across gender: a comparative study,"Al-Nuaimi, M.N.","Purpose Despite the ever-increasing importance of cultivating information, communication and technology literacy skills among college students, they have yet to be related to comprehensive measuring instruments. A glance at the empirical literature reveals that most pertinent scales have been confined to measuring Internet literacy skills, whereas educators in the 21st century advocate an inclusive conceptualization of ICT literacy. Such a comprehensive conceptualization embodies technical, critical, cognitive and emotional competencies. Additionally, more empirical evidence is needed to indicate gaps in testing measurement invariance of ICT literacy scales across genders or cultures. To that end, the current study aims to adapt and cross-validate an ICT literacy self-efficacy scale across gender by testing the measurement invariance using a multiple-sampling confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA). Furthermore, the current study aims to verify the ICT literacy self-efficacy scale's psychometric properties to establish its construct validity and understand the scale's underlying factorial structure. Design/methodology/approach The current study has administered the scale to a cross-sectional sample of 3560 undergraduate students enrolled in six universities in the Sultanate of Oman. Findings The results have revealed that the ICT literacy self-efficacy exhibits satisfactory indices of construct validity. On the other hand, the results of MCFA demonstrate that the differences in the goodness of fit indices between the nested models and the baseline model were below the cut-off criterion of 0.01, indicating invariance. Therefore, the scale has proved to be amenable for comparing genders on their ICT literacy self-efficacy using an one-way multivariate analysis of variance. Originality/value The study has several implications for research and pedagogical practices. The study provides empirical evidence for establishing ICT literacy self-efficacy as a distinct high-domain construct of task-specific self-efficacy beliefs.",2023,/,Performance Measurement and Metrics,24,3/4,176-94,,10.1108/PMM-03-2021-0014,,#109,Al-Nuaimi 2023,"",""
Measuring underrepresented student perceptions of inclusion within engineering departments and universities,"Lee, Walter C.; Matusovich, Holly M.; Brown, Philip R.","Despite efforts made by the engineering community, the struggle to increase racial and ethnic diversity continues. As women and ethnic minorities make up a larger percentage of the United States labor force, academic departments need to support the development of students from these talent pools. To improve the retention of these students, engineering departments need to be inclusive, allowing students to feel welcomed, valued, respected, and supported. The overall purpose of this study was to develop and pilot a survey instrument, grounded in Tinto's Model of Institutional Departure, to provide engineering educators and administrators with a tool that can be used to investigate how underrepresented engineering students rate the level of inclusion within engineering departments, paying close attention to gender and race/ ethnicity. Herein we specifically report on the instrument development and the initial findings through data collected from two public, predominately White research institutions with high undergraduate engineering student enrollment. Our results demonstrate that the Engineering Department Inclusion Level (EDIL) survey can yield valid and reliable scores with the population of interest. Before embarking on further data collection to continue developing the survey, we wanted to determine what value the survey might have. Results indicate no differences between men and women from underrepresented populations but that African-Americans rated the same environments less inclusive than other racial/ ethnic groups across all of the scales. Finally, PhD students scored University Pride lower than participants at other academic levels. Moreover, based on initial data results, we suggest further research on feelings of inclusion as an important aspect to creating a diverse environment.",2014,,International Journal of Engineering Education,30,1,150-165,,,,#110,Lee 2014,"",""
"Exploring the Link Between Social Media Engagement, Social Anxiety, and Environmental Preferences in University Students","Wang, Lan; Zhang, Xia; Xie, Aolin","As mental health issues become increasingly prominent, social anxiety is prevalent among university students and significantly affects their social behaviors and environmental preferences. With the increasing reliance on social media, understanding how these behaviors shape preferences for physical social environments is crucial for designing supportive campus spaces. This study investigates the relationship between social anxiety, social media usage, and environmental preferences in campus settings. We aim to identify the key environmental factors that can promote healthier social interactions for students with varying levels of social anxiety and social media use. Data were collected from university students through a structured questionnaire assessing demographic characteristics, online and offline behavior, social media usage intensity, social anxiety level, and environmental preferences. Using K-means clustering, participants were grouped into four clusters based on their social media usage and social anxiety levels. ANOVA and Multivariate Multiple Regression (MMR) were conducted to examine differences in environmental preferences across these clusters. Significant differences in environmental preferences were observed across the four clusters. Gender and grade influenced social anxiety levels, with females and undergraduate students reporting greater anxiety. Individuals with high social media use, regardless of their anxiety levels, generally exhibited stronger preferences for various environmental dimensions, including openness, convenience, facility provision, safety/comfort, and cultural landscape. However, individuals with higher social anxiety tended to prefer enclosed, facility-rich, and more controlled environments. The relationship between social anxiety and preferences for convenience, safety/comfort, and cultural landscape was minimal or non-significant. This study highlights the importance of considering both behavioral and psychological factors when designing university social environments. By identifying specific environmental preferences of students with high social anxiety, the findings offer evidence-based recommendations for creating more inclusive and supportive campus spaces that promote positive social interactions and well-being. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Buildings,14,10,,,10.3390/buildings14103284,,#111,Wang 2024,"",""
Visual Ethnographic Evaluation of Construction Programs at Public Universities: Who is Valued in Construction Education?,"Burgoon, J.; Arneson, E.; Elliott, J.W.; Valdes-Vasquez, R.","The US construction management profession has failed to recruit and retain women and underrepresented racial-ethnic minorities (URMs) in the workforce, despite growing industry demand for college-educated graduates due to skilled-labor shortages. Women and URM students in four-year construction education programs are more likely to change majors or drop out when they are unable to develop a sense of belonging in their degree program, exacerbating the lack of diversity and labor shortages in the construction industry. Students' physical learning environment on campus can convey nonverbal messages regarding belonging, and can therefore influence student retention and persistence. This study systematically evaluated 140 physical artifacts (art, signs, photographs, etc.) on display in three construction education programs at US land-grant universities. Utilizing an existing visual anthropological taxonomy designed to interpret equity messages communicated by artifacts, researchers explored nonverbal messages relating to the question of who is valued and who belongs' in construction education. White men were regularly named and represented in positions of power and leadership in the evaluated artifacts. In contrast, women and URMs were typically underrepresented and unnamed, with people of color overly portrayed in construction manual labor roles. Results suggest that construction education programs can foster more inclusive student learning environments by diversifying and updating physical artifacts on display within department public spaces and classrooms.",2021,07/01,Journal of Management in Engineering,37,4,04021025 (12 pp.),,10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000899,,#112,Burgoon 2021,"",""
How does parenthood affect an ICT practitioner’s work?

The studies indicate that mothers and fathers working in the software industry had to reconcile homework, work activities, and child care. Objective: This study investigates the impact of parenthood on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and how the fathers perceive the mothers’ challenges. Recognizing their difficulties and knowing the mothers’ challenges can be the first step towards making the work environment friendlier for everyone. Method: We surveyed 155 fathers from industry and academia from 10 different countries, however, most of the respondents are from Brazil (92.3%). Data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. We employed Grounded Theory to identify factors related to (i) paternity leave, (ii) working time after paternity, (iii) childcare-related activities, (iv) prejudice at work after paternity, (v) fathers’ perception of prejudice against mothers, (vi) challenges and difficulties in paternity. We also conduct a correlational and regression analysis to explore some research questions further. Results: In general, fathers do not suffer harassment or prejudice at work for being fathers. However, they perceive that mothers suffer distrust in the workplace and live with work overload because they have to dedicate themselves to many activities. They also suggested actions to mitigate parents’ difficulties. Conclusions: Despite some fathers wanting to participate more in taking care of their children, others do not even recognize the difficulties that mothers can face in the work. Therefore, it is important to explore the problems and implement actions to build a more parent-friendly work environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Empirical Software Engineering,29,6,,,10.1007/s10664-024-10534-9,,#113,Rocha 2024,"",""
Influential factors on e-learning adoption of university students with disability: Effects of type of disability,"Yildiz, Gizem; Sahin, Ferhan; Doan, Ezgi; Okur, Muhammet Recep","The number of studies providing empirical evidence on e-learning in the field of special education is limited. From this point of view, the aim of this study is to examine whether the factors influencing the e-learning adoption of university students with disability differ according to the type of disability and gender. The participants of the study consist of 809 university students with a single disability (orthopaedic, visual or hearing). Confirmatory factor analysis and two-way ANOVA were used in the analysis of the study. The factor analysis showed that validity and reliability of the measurement tool was established and the model fit was good. The results revealed that for all dependent variables (social influence, self-efficacy, compatibility and facilitating conditions), students with orthopaedic disability and visual impairment had higher scores than students with hearing impairment. On the other hand, contrary to expectations, there was no difference between students with orthopaedic disability and students with visual impairment in any of the factors according to the type of disability. In addition, none of the factors differed by gender. The findings provide empirical evidence that can contribute to the planning of online education processes of students with disability by revealing the similarities and differences in the use of e-learning systems according to the type of disability. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The field of special education deals with the special needs of individuals and frequently uses technology to provide the support they need. It is observed that educational processes have been moved to online environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the field of education nowadays and e-learning systems in online environments have become indispensable for students with special needs. With their flexible structure, e-learning systems create universal and inclusive learning environments for all students. Accessibility and special education adaptations are needed for individuals with special needs to use e-learning systems effectively. For this, first of all, the effects of the disabilities of these individuals in using e-learning systems should be determined. What this paper adds The results showed that social influence, self-efficacy, compatibility, and facilitating conditions all differed significantly by type of disability. The research findings revealed that all factors differed significantly in terms of orthopaedic and visual impairment versus hearing impairment. The main contribution of the study can be summarized as investigating the relationships between technology adoption and types of disability with empirical evidence and the fact that the implications and inferences made for theory and practice have the potential to make critical contributions to technology acceptance and use of individuals with special needs. It can be stated that the tool adapted in this study offers a valid and reliable tool for future studies with university students with special needs. Implications for practice and/or policy There is a need for considering the individual differences of participants and adaptations for hearing in the adoption of e-learning systems. Individual differences should be taken into account in the designs of e-learning systems, and user-oriented designs should be given priority. It can be mentioned that providing subtitle support for live lessons and recorded videos for the hearing impairment and adding sign and text support to the audio stimuli, providing screen readers for the visual impairment in the e-learning system can make valuable contributions to improving the quality of education. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.",2022,,British Journal of Educational Technology,53,6,2029-2049,,10.1111/bjet.13235,,#115,Yildiz 2022,"",""

An exploratory study of instructors' perceptions on inclusion of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education,"Kumi-Yeboah, Alex; Amponsah, Samuel","The rapid growth of diverse learners in online learning has made it imperative for online instructors to incorporate multicultural resource curricula and instructional activities. This research aimed to explore online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education; examine how instructors integrate culturally responsive pedagogy strategies in the online learning environment; and explore the challenges in facilitating cross-cultural collaborative learning for students from different cultural backgrounds. Data were collected following a qualitative multi-site case study method with five academic disciplines (Education, Social Sciences, Engineering, Physical Sciences and Health Sciences) in 12 colleges and universities in the United States of America. In all, 60 in-depth and semi-structured interviews with instructors (26 females and 34 males) were obtained and analysed following a constant comparative analysis approach. Results reflected that the instructors used cross-cultural interactions to facilitate students' engagement and incorporated culturally responsive teaching. Besides, the findings revealed that most of the instructors integrated diverse and internationalized learning content to support diverse students and addressed the impact of multicultural education in online learning. It was, however, noted, that instructors in the physical science disciplines struggled to incorporate culturally diverse contents in their online classes. The findings of this study foster discourse on how best instructors could be aided to engage diverse students online more meaningfully. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Since studies of this nature are mostly undertaken in teaching and learning environments that are diverse in terms of student populations, both students and instructors are exposed to cultural differences in teaching and learning in multicultural/diverse online learning environments. Studies on multicultural/diverse online learning environments abound and have been undertaken for several years but the emphasis has mainly been to explore issues from the perspectives of students. Most online instructors assume that online learning provides equal opportunities to all students regardless of their cultural backgrounds and cultural differences; hence, instructors have mostly not been able to recognize cultural implications for students' learning to design inclusive instructional strategies to meet the learning needs of diverse students in online education. What this paper adds This study, unlike earlier ones with a similar focus, explored online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP), specifically with regards to the design, preparation and integration of multicultural learning contents and resources in online education. This study employed Scott et al.'s (2015) culturally responsive computing theory as a lens to connect students' prior learning experiences, knowledge, interests, strengths and weaknesses as a way to draw instructors' attention to how best diverse students can be aided to be innovative and succeed in the face of cross-cultural challenges they face studying online. The study also contributes to the instructors' understanding of culturally responsive pedagogical principles in online spaces that recognize global identities and cultural experiences to meet the needs of diverse students in an online learning environment. Implications for practice and/or policy Instructors must develop online courses with the focus to bridge students' geographical and cultural backgrounds so that students will have the opportunity to share and connect with peers in online classrooms for effective collaboration and communication. Institutions that offer online education must make concerted efforts to provide continuous professional development opportunities for instructors of online courses on impacts of culture/diversity in the online classroom, and strategies for creating conducive online learning environments that value cultural differences, and social/educational experiences in ways that support students' learning. Institutions and stakeholders, through policy initiatives, should make frantic efforts to afford instructors with comprehensive knowledge and understanding of CRP in online learning to avoid the assumption that students in online courses share similar learning characteristics and bring to the online learning the same experiences and cultural backgrounds. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.",2023,,British Journal of Educational Technology,54,4,878-897,,10.1111/bjet.13299,,#117,Kumi-Yeboah 2023,"",""

As this dynamic field continues its rapid expansion, there is an urgent need to increase the number of well-trained professionals globally. Consequently, advocating for nuclear medicine as a thriving field of study and work for women becomes paramount in ensuring the establishment of a robust workforce capable of meeting the growing demands. True gender equality will only be achieved when there is equal representation across the spectrum of the nuclear medicine professions, including nuclear medicine technologists, radiopharmacists, radiochemist, medical physicists, nuclear medicine physicians, administrators, academics, and leaders. Currently, the workforce exhibits an imbalance, with females predominating among nuclear medicine technologists, while the number of female physicians, and those in leadership positions remains comparatively lower. There are various factors which contribute to the existing inequities. Societal expectations often impose traditional gender roles that somehow discourage women from pursuing a career in the science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including nuclear medicine. Additionally, prevailing unequal work conditions and gender biases within the workplace can create barriers that hinder women's professional growth and development. Ways of addressing inequalities includes ensuring female participation at all levels of education and training and promoting the field at undergraduate level in medical school. Mentorship programs have demonstrated great success in guiding and supporting women at various stages of their careers. Therefore, there is a need for their expansion and enhancement. Furthermore, female role models play a pivotal role in shattering gender stereotypes and inspiring other women to pursue careers in nuclear medicine and its related fields.

Generating a framework for gender and sexual diversity-inclusive STEM education,"Wright, G.W.; Delgado, C.","Students who identify as LGBTQ continue to report feelings of being unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Access to a gender and sexual diversity (GSD)-inclusive curriculum and supportive teachers may positively improve the school climate for LGBTQ students, but these supports are often not included in STEM classrooms. One response is to ensure that STEM teachers are prepared to integrate GSD-inclusive STEM teaching into their classrooms.

The 81 selected studies were qualitatively analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and epistemic network analysis, and the findings showed that GSD-inclusive STEM education literature coheres around six highly related constructs: Heteronormativity, Social Justice, Epistemic Knowledge of Science and Inquiry, Identity, Embodiment, and GSD language. Identifying these constructs, and the connections among them, led to the generation of an operational framework of GSD-inclusive STEM teaching that can inform and guide STEM teacher education programs and STEM teacher professional development to develop STEM educators' equity literacy around GSD to foster bias-free, equitable, inclusive STEM classrooms. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2023,/,Science Education,,,713-40,,10.1002/sce.21786,,#121,Wright 2023,"",""
The effects of active learning on students’ sense of belonging and academic performance in introductory physics courses,"Li, Yangqiuting; Bernardi, Rafael C; Burkholder, Eric","Research-based active learning strategies have been shown to have positive effects on students’ learning in physics class. However, the exploration of active learning’s impact on students’ sense of belonging in physics classrooms remains limited. In this paper, we present our findings pertaining to students’ sense of belonging in an introductory physics course at a large public research university. This course was taught by three different instructors, one of whom integrated research-based active learning strategies, while the other two employed traditional lecture-based approaches. Our results show a statistically significant decrease in the sense of belonging among students in the traditionally taught classes, in contrast to a modest increase in students’ sense of belonging in the active learning class. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant gender difference in students’ sense of belonging at the beginning of the course, which was closed by the end of the active learning class but persisted in the traditional classes. In addition, the active learning class exhibited a positive impact on students’ academic outcomes, and this effect was partially mediated by the sense of belonging. Our findings indicate that active learning classes, particularly those thoughtfully designed to foster inclusive environments, may benefit students’ sense of belonging and enhance their academic performance without relying on the use of specific belonging interventions. © 2024 The Author(s).

A holistic understanding of inclusion in STEM: Systemic challenges and support for women and LGBT+ academics and PhD students,"Reggiani, M.; Gagnon, J.D.; Lunn, R.J.","Barriers to equity, diversity, and inclusion remain in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) for historically underrepresented and marginalized individuals. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women and LGBT+ academics and PhD students in the United Kingdom. Specifically, this article examines systemic challenges and support that 82 participants who identified as women and/or LGBT+ academics and PhD students have experienced in their STEM environments and throughout their careers. In this qualitative study, we employed intersectionality theory to frame a thematic analysis of interviews and focus groups. Our findings indicate that the experiences of participants are characterized more by inequities than by support from colleagues, peers, and higher education institutions. Inequities are widespread and intersectional, and have a cumulative impact whenever individuals endure multiple and potentially escalating challenges—which include hard-to-spot disadvantages, stereotypes, prejudice, as well as harassment, bullying, and discrimination. Participants' accounts illustrate the benefits of different support mechanisms but also the limitations of initiatives to support marginalized individuals and groups in STEM that are not systematically embedded across institutions. Based on our findings, we present two conceptual models to better understand systemic challenges and their consequences for women and LGBT+ academics and PhD students in STEM, as well as to inform more holistic support mechanisms to create more inclusive STEM environments. Implications from the study highlight institutional accountability as key to improving climates and transformative change. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2024,/,Science Education,108,6,1637-69,,10.1002/sce.21899,,#124,Reggiani 2024,"",""
Damage caused by women’s lower self-efficacy on physics learning,"Kalender, Z.Y.; Marshman, E.; Schunn, C.D.; Nokes-Malach, T.J.; Singh, C.","Self-efficacy is an aspect of students’ motivation that has been shown to play a critical role in students’ engagement, participation, and retention in academic careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Since women are underrepresented in STEM domains such as physics, we studied female and male students’ self-efficacy and its relation to learning outcomes in physics that can be useful for creating equitable and inclusive learning environments. In a longitudinal study, we surveyed approximately 1400 students in calculus-based physics 2 courses to investigate students’ motivational beliefs in physics using a validated survey. We examined female and male students’ self-efficacy scores and the extent to which self-efficacy related to learning outcomes (students’ grades and conceptual post-test scores), especially the significant gender difference in conceptual post-test scores. To reveal the unique contribution of self-efficacy on outcomes, we controlled for several other variables including Physics 1 grades, SAT math scores, and conceptual pretest scores in physics. We found that the gender differences in conceptual post-test performance were mediated by the model variables. In particular, initial self-efficacy differences showed a direct effect on outcomes even when controlling for students’ prior physics knowledge and skill differences, and self-efficacy also had the strongest total gender effect on conceptual learning. Given these findings, future work should focus on better understanding the drivers of these self-efficacy differences including the role that societal stereotypes and biases play in these in order to mitigate these differences.",2020,01/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,16,1,010118 (15 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.16.010118,,#125,Kalender 2020,"",""

Developing an Innovative Sustainable Science Education Ecosystem: Lessons from Negative Impacts of Inequitable and Non-Inclusive Learning Environments,"Cwik, S.; Singh, C.","Societal stereotypes and biases about who belongs in science courses and who can excel in them can impact short- and long-term outcomes of students from marginalized groups, e.g., women, including their grades and beliefs about science as well as retention in science disciplines. Therefore, developing a sustainable science education ecosystem requires fostering equitable and inclusive learning environments in which students from all demographic groups have comparable outcomes. Here we describe a study with more than five hundred students in an introductory physics course at a large research university in the US that investigated female and male students' perceptions of the inclusiveness of the learning environment (including their sense of belonging, perceived recognition by others such as instructors, and perceived effectiveness of peer interaction) and how it predicted their physics course grades, self-efficacy, interest, and identity at the end of the course. We find gender differences in perceptions of the inclusiveness of the learning environment disadvantaging female students and that these perceptions played a major role in explaining student outcomes.

"Inclusive workplace and organizational citizenship behavior: Study of a higher education institution, India","Panicker, A.; Agrawal, R.K.; Khandelwal, U.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between employees’ perception of an inclusive workplace, namely, inclusive practices, inclusive climate and inclusive leadership and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). It also attempts to examine the difference in perception toward the inclusive workplace along the three major dimensions of diversity, namely, gender, category they belong to and their religious orientation. Design/methodology/approach - Non-probability sampling technique is employed to collect primary data through a self-administered questionnaire from 492 academicians of a higher education institution situated in western Uttar Pradesh of India. The data set was analyzed using statistical tools like descriptive statistics (z-test and ANOVA), and multiple regression analysis. Findings - Results of the multiple regression analysis reflected direct and significant relationship between inclusive workplace and OCB. It has been observed that organizations with a conducive climate of inclusion, a well formulated inclusive practices and strong leaders’ commitment will result into high level of OCB which is apparent among employees working in a higher education institution western Uttar Pradesh. The results of z-test reflected that male and female employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate. However, there is a significant difference in perception toward inclusive practices and inclusive leadership on OCB. On the other hand, results of ANOVA reflected that with respect to religious orientation there is no significant difference among perceptions toward inclusive workplace. However in case of category employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate in contrast with inclusive practices and inclusive leadership. Research limitations/implications - The present study established the concept of inclusive workplace, entirely on the basis of individual viewpoint. While to examine the cause and effect relationship of an inclusive workplace on OCB, it is recommended to incorporate some moderating or intervening variables. Practical implications - This study provides guidelines for academic institutions to understand and foster an inclusive workplace that will encourage the academicians to exhibit OCB.

How Engineering Identity of First-Year Female and Male Engineering Majors is Predicted by Their Physics Self-Efficacy and Identity,"Li, Yangqiuting; Singh, Chandralekha","Physics courses are important for engineering students because not only are they the foundation for many engineering courses, but students' physics motivational beliefs such as self-efficacy and identity may also influence their engineering identity as well as their choice of careers. In this study, we investigated first-year undergraduate engineering students' engineering identity and how it is predicted by their physics motivational beliefs (including physics self-efficacy, interest, perceived recognition and identity) in a calculus-based introductory physics course at a large research university in the US. We first investigated how these motivational beliefs change from the beginning to the end of the course (i.e., from pre to Post) using descriptive statistics. Then, we investigated the predictive relationships among these motivational constructs using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM analysis revealed that students' engineering identity is predicted by their physics self-efficacy and identity. However, the descriptive statistics results showed that both male and female students' physics self-efficacy and identity decreased from pre to post, and female students' physics self-efficacy dropped even more than male students' did. Although students' average score on engineering identity also decreased from pre to Post, this change was only statistically significant for male students. Our results show that students' physics perceived recognition is the strongest predictor of physics identity, and it also predicts students' engineering identity through physics identity and self-cfficacy. We note that even though there were significant gender differences disadvantaging women in all motivational constructs studied, gender does not directly predict engineering and physics identities, which means that the gender differences in both identities are mediated through physics self-efficacy, interest and perceived recognition. Thus, in order to boost students' engineering identity, it is important to create an equitable and inclusive environment for learning Physics, in which all students feel recognized and supported appropriately and develop a stronger physics and engineering identity. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

First steps toward gender equity in the chemistry Olympiad: Understanding the role of implicit gender-science stereotypes,"Steegh, Anneke; Hoffler, Tim; Hoft, Lars; Parchmann, Ilka","Girls are underrepresented in mathematical and science Olympiads, global informal learning activities which often serve as stepping stones for admission to top universities and future STEM careers. The present article aims to investigate the role of implicit gender-science stereotypes on representation and achievement among participants of the German Chemistry Olympiad using a cross-sectional online study (N = 445, mean age 16.5 years, 51% female) entailing the Implicit Association Test and two motivational scales. This study was the first of its kind to use moderated mediation analysis to examine the effects of gender-science stereotypes on participation and achievement, mediated by the expectancy and value beliefs self-concept and topic interest. We found that in the female group, gender-science stereotypes negatively predicted the participants' willingness to continue in the competition. This relationship was mediated through topic interest. In addition, we found self-concept predictive for further participation among female participants, as well as for competition score among both gender groups. Furthermore, topic interest positively predicted male participants' willingness to continue with the competition. The results underline the negative association of implicit gender stereotypes with female participation in the German Chemistry Olympiad. Organizations such as the German Chemistry Olympiad should therefore critically reflect on existing gender biases within their own structure. In doing so they can create an environment that has the potential to heighten self-concept and interest for all participants equally.

We identify challenges to and strategies for persistence and present recommendations for engineering institutions to create interventions that support women of color and mitigate institutional inequities. Scope/Method: Using the snowballing method, we identified 65 empirical studies published between 1999 and 2015 that met the criteria for this review. These studies represented qualitative, mixed-methods, and quantitative methodologies from various fields. We conducted a systematic thematic synthesis, informed by frames of intersectionality, critical race theory, and community cultural wealth.

In particular, the current study explored adolescent perceptions of school racial climate (SRC) as a potential contributor to pre-college racial disparities in STEM. We used latent class analysis to group adolescents based on their SRC perceptions and explored group differences in their interest in a STEM career and their belonging, psychological needs satisfaction, and engagement in STEM courses. Adolescent participants (N = 412, 50.2% female, 36.9% male, 12.9% other/not reported,Mage = 15.72 years, standard deviation = 1.24) attending five high schools in the Southeastern United States, were grouped into five classes based on their perceptions of SRC: Critical SRC (CritSRC), Average SRC, Average with Stereotyping, Positive SRC (PosSRC), and Positive with Stereotyping. Latent class membership differed by race, age, and learning environment. Results revealed that students with more positive perceptions of SRC reported greater belonging, engagement, and needs satisfaction in their STEM courses and more interest in a STEM career compared to students with CritSRC perceptions.

Additionally, this study assesses and compares the reality between the public Jordanian universities’ built environment and international universities based on the Americans with Disabilities Act checklist – version 2.1 – to provide an accessible built environment for physically disabled people. Furthermore, this study examines the satisfaction degree of physically disabled people with the built environment in selected universities. Besides, this study examines the relationships/interrelationships between the students’ demographic factors, design factors and the degree of the disabled students’ satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This research used different data collection methods to answer the research questions: literature review, observation and questionnaire. Additionally, this study used different analytical and statistical methods, such as comparative analysis between the local cases and the selected international case study based on the Americans with Disabilities Act checklist, version 2.1, descriptive analysis and Pearson r correlational statistics. Findings: This research found that the Jordanian public universities did not apply all required design factors to achieve a high degree of the built environment of accessibility and provide all the requirements and needs of physically disabled students like international universities. Additionally, half of the physically disabled students respondents were satisfied with the availability and quality of pathways, ramps, doors and corridors, non-slippery materials, elevators, accessible entrances, entrances doors, methods of openings, adequate spaces for wheelchair students at the configuration of the entrance and the availability of railing. In contrast, they were unsatisfied with the availability of parking and bathrooms for each gender and signage systems. Moreover, this research found no significant differences between gender and educational level and all factors that may impact the students’ satisfaction with campus environmental design. Furthermore, this research found that there was a strong to very strong positive linear association and a significant correlation/intercorrelation between the availability and the design quality of parking, entrances, doors, lobbies and corridors, bathrooms, signage systems and information, ramps, elevators and stairs and the disabled students’ satisfaction degree.

Undergraduate physics students' experiences: Exploring the impact of underrepresented identities and intersectionality,"Keblbeck, D.K.; Piatek-Jimenez, K.; Medina Medina, C.","Historically, physics has been a predominantly male field, with previous literature showing that there is little diversity among U.S. physics students at the undergraduate and graduate levels or among physicists within the work force. Recent research indicates that the lack of diversity in physics is partially due to an unwelcoming climate within physics departments, as well as differential experiences during college. Most physics education research that addresses the lack of underrepresented identities within the field has focused on the identities of women and people of color. There has been little research to investigate people with multiple underrepresented identities, including those such as socioeconomic status, first-generation college students, or learning disabilities. Furthermore, there has been even less research conducted to better understand the impacts of the intersection of these underrepresented identities and how it relates to experiences when pursuing a physics major. In order to address this gap in the literature, our research project has investigated undergraduate physics students' experiences to better understand what factors affect their experiences and how these may differ by the intersection of one's underrepresented identities. In particular, we explored how these identities impact their experiences as a physics major. To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with physics majors at one university to learn more about their college experiences regarding physics. Our findings suggest that there is a disproportionate number of obstacles when pursuing a physics major faced by those with a greater number of underrepresented identities. We conclude that there is a need for more equitable pedagogical practices and departmental policies within the undergraduate physics experience, in addition to a more ""human"" approach to mentorship, in order to foster an environment in which students with underrepresented identities can feel supported and thrive academically and professionally. In particular, we believe that dedicated formal pedagogical trainings that teach diverse teaching skills to accommodate students with different learning styles would be useful to many university physics instructors. This type of formal training would include annual workshops designed to educate faculty on how curriculum, pedagogy, and departmental practices can be altered to be more inclusive with the intent to ensure a more equitable and welcoming experience for all students. Additionally, incorporating mentorship programs that focus on a more individualized and natural support system would likely benefit all students, especially those with underrepresented identities, by creating a more welcoming and inclusive space within physics departments.",2024,/,Physical Review Physics Education Research,20,2,020120 (17 pp.),,10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.020120,,#138,Keblbeck 2024,"",""
Not feeling recognized as a physics person by instructors and teaching assistants is correlated with female students' lower grades,"Cwik, S.; Singh, C.","Student motivational beliefs in introductory physics courses can influence their course outcomes as well as their retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines and future career aspirations. Prior research has shown that students' perceived recognition by others as a physics person is important in predicting their physics identity and career choices. This study used validated survey data from 827 students in the first of two college algebra-based introductory physics courses primarily taken by bioscience majors, in which women make up approximately 67% of the class. We investigated how the students' perceived recognition by instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) as a physics person predicts their grade at the end of a mandatory physics course for bioscience majors in which women are not outnumbered by men. We found that overall women had lower perceived recognition than men as a physics person and their perceived recognition played an important role in predicting course grades controlling for high school GPA and math SAT scores. Since physics as a discipline presents a barrier to women due to deep-rooted societal stereotypes and biases about who can excel in it, the numerical representation of women alone in these courses does not imply that they will feel recognized by their instructors and TAs as a physics person without an intentional effort to make the learning environment equitable and inclusive.

"Effect of gender, self-efficacy, and interest on perception of the learning environment and outcomes in calculus-based introductory physics courses","Yangqiuting Li; Singh, C.","Students’ motivational beliefs about physics can influence their learning outcomes as well as retention in their majors and career choices. Moreover, due to societal stereotypes and biases about who belongs in physics and can succeed in physics, women often have lower motivational beliefs about physics than men. The expectancy-value theory emphasizes the importance of self-efficacy and value in predicting students’ short- and long-term academic and professional outcomes, but there are few studies focusing on how the learning environment shapes these motivational beliefs of women and men. Investigating how the perception of learning environment in introductory physics courses for the engineering, physical science, and mathematics majors in their first year of college predicts the motivational beliefs of women and men can be useful in making the learning environments equitable and inclusive so that the underrepresented students, e.g., women, are not disadvantaged. In this study, we adapt prior identity framework to investigate how the learning environment (including sense of belonging, perceived peer interaction, and perceived recognition) predicts students’ physics self-efficacy, interest, and identity by controlling for their self-efficacy and interest at the beginning of a calculus-based introductory physics course. We surveyed 1203 students, 35% of whom identified as women. We found signatures of inequitable and noninclusive learning environment in that not only were female students’ physics self-efficacy and interest lower than male students’ at the beginning of the course, but the gender gaps in these motivational constructs became even larger by the end of the course. Analysis revealed that the decrease in students’ physics self-efficacy and interest were mediated by the learning environment and predicted students’ physics identity.

Striving to achieve it all: men and work-family-life balance in Sweden and the UK,"Raiden, Ani Birgit; Raisanen, Christine","Although there is a vast literature on issues of work-life balance, most of the research is grounded on the traditional view of work-life balance as a female-oriented entitlement. So far little attention has been paid to how men balance their work-life situations, especially the 'new men' who are keen to share the family care. We contribute to filling this gap by critically examining how male academics in construction-related departments at universities in Sweden and the UK construct their relationships with family and work. Narrative analysis was applied on in-depth interviews with seven academics from each country, who were at different phases in their careers. Three core narratives emerged from the data: family connected with partner; work as key priority; and desire to pursue personal projects, all of which competed for the narrators' sparse time. The narrative that by far received most space and most storylines in all the interviews was 'work as priority', implying that in spite of gender equality policies and campaigns, work-life balance remains a female-oriented concern. Both Swedish and British men in our sample found juggling family and life most challenging. This work-family-life triad left many feeling that they had no time to do a good job in any sphere and in Sweden in particular combination pressure was intense. Curiously, despite these tensions and increasing demands for many of our respondents work remains a positive construct, possibly because of the strong conceptual identification of 'self' as an academic. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",2013,,Construction Management and Economics,31,8,899-913,,10.1080/01446193.2013.802364,,#143,Raiden 2013,"",""
‘I know it exists … but I haven't experienced it personally’: Older Canadian men's perceptions of ageism as a distant social problem,"Clarke, Laura Hurd; Korotchenko, Alexandra","This paper examines how older men perceive, experience and internalise ageist prejudice in the context of their everyday lives. We draw on in-depth interviews with 29 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 65–89. Although one-third of our participants were unfamiliar with the term ageism, the majority felt that age-based discrimination was prevalent in Canadian society. Indicating that they themselves had not been personally subjected to ageism, the men considered age-based discrimination to be a socially distant problem. The men explained their perceived immunity to ageism in terms of their youthful attitudes and active lifestyles. The men identified three groups who they considered to be particularly vulnerable to age-based discrimination, namely women, older workers and frail elders residing in institutions. At the same time, the majority of our participants had internalised a variety of ageist and sexist stereotypes. Indeed, the men assumed that later life was inevitably a time of physical decline and dependence, and accepted as fact that older adults were grumpy, poor drivers, unable to learn new technologies and, in the case of older women, sexually unattractive. In this way, a tension existed between the men's assertion that ageism did not affect their lives and their own internalisation of ageist stereotypes. We consider our findings in relation to the theorising about ageism and hegemonic masculinity.

"‘More than boy, girl, male, female’: Exploring young people’s views on gender diversity within and beyond school contexts","Bragg, Sara; Renold, Emma; Ringrose, Jessica; Jackson, Carolyn","This paper explores the views of young people aged 12–14 on gender diversity, drawing upon school-based qualitative data from a study conducted in England in 2015–2016. Although earlier feminist and queer research in schools often found evidence of variable local gender cultures and gender non-conformity, we argue that the contemporary context, with its increasing global awareness of gender diversity, offers young people significant new ways of learning about and doing gender. Findings reveal that many young people have expanded vocabularies of gender identity/expression; critical reflexivity about their own positions; and principled commitments to gender equality, gender diversity and the rights of gender and sexual minorities. We also show how young people are negotiating wider cultures of gendered and sexual violence. Schools are providing some spaces and learning opportunities to support gender and sexual diversity. However, overall, it appears that young people’s immediate social cultural worlds are constructed in such a way that gender binary choices are frequently inevitable, from school uniforms and toilets to sports cultures and friendships. Our conclusion touches on the implications of these findings for how educational practitioners, external agencies and young people can address gender rights, equality and justice in schools and beyond.

Altering perceptions of mutual value by reframing diversity as a resource: an intervention to improve learning climate and reduce gender disparities in mathematics,"Mitamura, Chelsea","Though women increasingly participate in mathematics courses, substantial gender disparities persist across math domains, with women consistently underperforming compared to their male counterparts. We argue that these disparities are caused in part by learning climates in math environments that negatively affect female students. We suggest that learning climate emerges out of the dynamic interaction between students' perceptions of themselves and the network of perceptions of each other in the learning context, and, more precisely, students' mutual perceptions of their own and others' value in these settings. As a result of cultural gender stereotypes that portray women as less competent than men in science and math, female students come to view themselves under a cloud of suspicion (Steele, 1997) regarding their ability, and, consequently, expect to be undervalued in math settings. Likewise, many male students expect female students to be underqualified in these domains and consequently undervalue their contributions. We argue that these expectations lead to a host of cascading and detrimental effects for female engagement, learning, and performance and ultimately contribute to climates that perpetuate gender disparities in educational outcomes in mathematics fields. Across 2 studies, therefore, the present work evaluates the extent to which female students expect to be undervalued by others relative to their male peers in a mathematics context (Study 1) and tests an intervention designed to reshape climate by shifting the value students perceive in diversity, and therefore each other, in small mathematics learning groups (Study 2). We do this by providing students with evidence and instructions on how to use peers as a resource for learning and improved performance. Study 2 also evaluates who is in the best position to leverage the intervention to most effectively change group climate. We explore this question by administering the intervention to all students, only to male students, only to female students, or to a no-students (control) in four person (3 male, 1 female) learning group. Results across studies suggest that, in general, women do anticipate being and report feeling undervalued in math contexts relative to their male peers. However, the resource framing intervention does not affect change in self-perceptions of value, regardless of intervention target. The resource framing intervention does influence the extent to which male and female students value their group members depending on who receives the intervention. The intervention also differentially affects the number of times males and females participate in a video-recorded group math task. In addition to providing initial insight into a new intervention with potential to reduce gender disparities in mathematics, the present work highlights the importance of considering who receives an intervention and suggests that truly shifting learning climate may require students to interact repeatedly over time.

Here, we critically examine the peer-review system in psychology and neuroscience at multiple levels, from ideas to institutions, interactions, and individuals. We highlight initiatives that aim to change the normative negativity of peer review and provide authors with constructive, actionable feedback that is sensitive to diverse identities, methods, topics, and environments. We conclude with a call to action for how individuals, groups, and organizations can improve the culture of peer review. We provide examples of how changes in the peer-review system can be made with an eye to diversity (increasing the range of identities and experiences constituting the field), equity (fair processes and outcomes across groups), and inclusion (experiences that promote belonging across groups). These changes can improve scientists’ experience of peer review, promote diverse perspectives and identities, and enhance the quality and impact of science.

Then it reviews the key convictions held by equal sharers that facilitate their equality: feminism, anti-essentialism, familism, and anti-materialism. It examines the diverse influences of their families of origin on the development of those ideas and their corresponding behaviors. In addition, the chapter considers government policies as facilitators of equal sharing. Finally, the chapter reviews the rewards of equal sharing, which span the globe.

"'Damned if you do, doomed if you don’t': The influence of sexism, gender, and rejection behaviors on the potential for stereotyping and workplace prejudice and discrimination","Stratmoen, Evelyn","Across three studies, the relationships between gender, rejection behavior, and ambivalent sexist attitudes on perceptions of a coworker (i.e., target) who rejects another coworker's (i.e., suitor) romantic interest were examined. Perceptions regarding the target's adherence to feminine gender norms, stereotyping (via the Stereotype Content Model (SCM); Fiske et al., 2002), and engagement of active harm via workplace prejudice and discrimination were examined. Factors that might influence these perceptions were manipulated, including the context of the rejection (i.e., target versus suitor), the target's use of mitigated speech, the gender of the target, and the target's rejection behavior. Study 1 examined the context of the rejection (i.e., being a target vs being a suitor) and gender differences in the endorsement of direct and indirect rejection strategies. Study 2 examined the effect of the target's gender (i.e., male vs female) and their rejection behavior (i.e., direct vs indirect) on bystanders' perceptions of the target's adherence to feminine gender norms, stereotyping, and engaging in active harm (i.e., likelihood to engage in workplace prejudice and discrimination against the target). Study 3 examined the effect of a female target's rejection behavior and her use of a low-powered form of communication (i.e., using mitigated speech vs not using mitigated speech) on male suitors' perceptions of her adhering to feminine gender norms, stereotyping, and their engagement of active harm. Overall, the results showed that while men prefer direct rejection strategies (i.e., being told explicitly their romantic interest is not reciprocated), women who use these rejection strategies may be perceived as not adhering to feminine gender norms and, thereby, may experience backlash in the workplace. Furthermore, men's hostile sexist attitudes may lead to a greater deterrent of workplace advancements and promotions for female coworkers who engage in rejection, while men's benevolent sexist attitudes indicate expectations for women to engage in rejection behaviors that mitigate the harshness of the rejection. Therefore, women who reject a male coworker's romantic interest may be stuck in a double bind conundrum of 'damned if you do, doomed if you don't,' where men prefer to be rejected in a straightforward manner, but there may be social consequences for doing so.

Twelve general types of barriers or challenges were identified from the interviews. Eight different strategies were used to help clients move past barriers/challenges. Coaches are effective in moving aspiring female leaders past barriers; however, more work is needed in leadership identity development. Women face more barriers to advancement than men and consequently more developmental support is needed to achieve greater diversity at the highest ranks of leadership.

"Gender bias in leadership: Do gender of leader, type of error, diversity climate, and gender of subordinate affect faculty perceptions of academic leaders' effectiveness?","Alfaro, Adriana","The cyphers don't lie: women remain significantly underrepresented in positions of authority across the United States, despite their nearly equal representation in the labor force. Gender bias has been proposed as one of the major reasons for the disparity in leadership roles between men and women. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether gender bias influenced faculty's perceptions of leadership effectiveness at a Research 1 (R1) Doctoral institution in the southeastern United States when high-ranking university leaders made mistakes, and how type of error, diversity climate, and gender of subordinate affected this relationship.Two scenarios were created based on real-life examples provided by academic leaders via interviews, and each scenario was led by either a male department director or a female department director, for a total of four test conditions: 1) relationship error committed by a female leader, 2) relationship error committed by a male leader, 3) task error committed by a female leader, and 4) task error committed by a male leader.The study findings did not conform to the predictions formulated based on the literature review. Gender of leader was not found to significantly influence subordinate perceptions of leader effectiveness when mistakes were made (H1). Likewise, whether the error was task-oriented or relationship-oriented (H2), and whether the participant was male or female (H3) did not produce differential ratings of leader performance based on gender. Although diversity climate did significantly relate to perceptions of leader effectiveness, it did not interact with gender of leader, failing to support hypothesis 4.

Gender equality in higher education: Faculty perspectives,"Krupa, Cynthia","The problem of gender inequality has been a persistent and unresolved issue in social and professional life in the United States of America and globally. The implications of the problem for higher education proved to be omnipresent, including women's underrepresentation in leadership positions, gender-based discrimination cases, sexual harassment, inequality-oriented organizational culture, and HR-practices. Despite measures implemented to prevent and eliminate gender issues, including regulatory, organizational, and community initiatives, inequality remains prevalent in higher education settings, threatening career advancement and personal accomplishment opportunities for women. Representation of women in higher education leadership positions is scarce, illustrating male dominance in science, technologies, engineering, and mathematics. This dissertation aimed to identify the causes and prevalence of gender-based discrimination and explore the most effective practices for eliminating the problem and develop a diversity training program for higher education institutions. The theoretical frameworks used for the study were the Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Neo-Positivist Theory. The research utilized a qualitative design to investigate the problem and find solutions to it. Data was collected through document review and online interviews with thirteen sampled participants representing a diverse population of higher education leaders from the USA.

Investigating gender differences in students’ motivational beliefs and inclusiveness of the learning environment in introductory physics courses for bioscience majors,"Cwik, Sonja","Student grades and motivational outcomes in introductory physics courses can influence their retention in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and future career aspirations. In recent years, many research studies have focused on inequities in calculus-based introductory physics courses, e.g., by investigating gender differences in students' motivational beliefs such as self-efficacy, interest, and identity and how they change from the beginning to the end of a physics course or course sequence. However, these issues have not been investigated in introductory physics courses for bioscience majors, in which women outnumber men. Although women outnumber men in these courses, societal stereotypes and biases about who can do and excel in physics may impact women in these courses unless there is an intentional effort to create equitable and inclusive learning environments.In this dissertation I address the question of equity in introductory physics courses for students on the bioscience track by investigating the relationship between gender, motivational beliefs, and physics performance. Through my quantitative studies, I first analyzed gender differences in students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and recognition by others and how they predict course grade. Then, I investigated whether the relation between gender and physics identity was mediated by students' self-efficacy, interest, and recognition by others. Lastly, I investigated how students' perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment including students' sense of belonging, interactions with their peers, and recognition by instructors and TAs predicts their physics identity and grades in the introductory physics courses. These findings can be invaluable for instructors striving to make these courses more equitable and inclusive. Throughout the thesis, there is discussion of how these findings can provide guidelines to improve women's experiences and achievement in these introductory physics courses.

"Investigating gender diversity, equity, and inclusivity and students’ experiences within collegiate team-based learning environments","Saad, Marissa Elizabeth","As the United States works towards strengthening and diversifying the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce, many national charges aim to increase the quantity of female participants, while overlooking how systematic barriers affect the quality of female students' education. Many STEM workforce development programs, such as the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, are committed to improving the nation's diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) efforts, enabling technical education through hands-on team-based learning (TBL) environments.The purpose of this study was to take a holistic approach to assess how gender DEI in STEM team environments influence the quality of female students' learning outcomes and experiences. The socio-ecological framework, guided by feminist standpoint theory, was used to explore how the macro- and micro-levels affect female team members. Through a mixed-methods approach, this work presents two studies: 1) a qualitative document analysis (QDA) that analyzes STEM programs' recruitment documents and assesses how gender DEI is integrated into STEM programs' student-centric policies, and 2) a survey tool that analyzes how gender relates to technical task distribution and individual students' experiences.Data analysis showed that a lack of gender DEI integration into STEM programs negatively influences students' learning outcomes. First, almost all of the national STEM programs failed to embed gender DEI into the programmatic frameworks and strategic goals. Second, female students were statistically more likely to lead the non-technical tasks on STEM teams, reinforcing the traditional gender roles found in the literature. Also, although female students reported similar motivation levels as the male students, they were less likely to: (a) conduct technical tasks, χ2 (1, N = 203) = 7.8, p = .005, (b) feel like they can lead group work and be effective, χ2 (3, N = 192) = 12.9, p = .005, and (c) feel like they belong to the STEM community, χ2 (5, N = 196) = 10.7, p = .05. Female students were also statistically more likely to (d) feel like an outsider, χ2 (5, N = 196) = 11.8, p = .04, and (e) believe they can effectively coordinate tasks and activities of a group, χ2 (3, N = 192) = 12.9, p = .005.These findings add to a growing body of literature that national efforts are not sustaining a conducive environment that promotes equitable learning experiences. The STEM workforce will fail to see its full potential until systems of inequalities are addressed at all levels of the socio-ecological system.

Managing negative behavior in a diverse workplace,"Kline, Erika","Managing diversity in the workplace is a challenging task for supervisors. Supervisors must punish negative behavior consistently, regardless their employees' demographic characteristics. Some research suggests that negative workplace behaviors committed by lower status group members (e.g., Black people or women) are attributed to more internal factors and penalized more severely compared to higher status group members (e.g., White people or men; Duncan, 1979; Bowles & Gelfand, 2009; Luksyte, et al., 2013). However, recent evidence of pro-Black biases in judgments (Mendes & Koslov, 2013; Zigerell, 2018), challenge the perspective that evaluators are intentionally biased against Black people. If individuals deliberately compensate for pro-White biases by demonstrating pro-Black behaviors as some researchers suggest (Axt, et al., 2016), the negative workplace behaviors of Black employees may be punished less severely than white employees regardless of their gender or the reasons for their transgressions. The present research examined interactions between attribution, employee gender, and employee race when predicting punishment of negative workplace behaviors. In two studies, participants took the role of a supervisor and read descriptions of employees who violated workplace rules. In Study 1 participants read eight descriptions of workplace rule violations, then responded to attribution, punishment type, punishment severity, seriousness of offense, and responsibility measures. In Study 2 participants read eight descriptions of workplace rule violations attributed to internal and external causes and responded to punishment severity, seriousness of offense, and responsibility measures. Race and gender of the employees committing each offense were randomized within each participant so that they each rated all eight combinations of race, gender, and attribution (Study 2). Study 1 found support for the pro-Black bias, participants made more internal attributions for negative behavior committed by women and White employees and punished their negative workplace behaviors more severely. Unlike Study 1, participants in Study 2 did not make punishment decisions based on employee gender or race. Instead, participants punished behaviors based on their causal explanations; behaviors explained with internal causes were punished more severely than behaviors explained with external causes. Focusing on attribution reduced the propensity to discriminate in favor or against employees based on their demographic characteristics. While race and gender can impact punishments for workplace rule violations, learning more information about causal factors may reduce the likelihood of biased decisions.

The data include 50 in-depth interviews and observation of 80 executive meetings. I pay special attention to longitudinal interviews with 19 high-level executives and explore how their ideologies about inequality affected their change efforts. I find that executives tend to favor individualistic and societal explanations of gender differences and inequality, and these explanations correspond with change efforts focused mainly on altering individuals or affecting external communities. Executives rarely engaged in attempts to change the organization structurally. Thus, the implementation of gender equality remains limited by top executives’ ideas and assumptions about the sources of inequality.

Role congruence stems from role congruity theory which posits that a woman in a leadership or masculine role will receive positive or negative evaluations based on the degree to which she conforms to her gender stereotype. The results demonstrated significant negative correlations between SDO, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and the recognition of gender microaggressions. Gender discrimination perceptions were also positively correlated with recognition of gender microaggressions. Results however did not support the prediction that males and females differ in the recognition of gender microaggressions. In that same vein, role congruity did not significantly interact with the independent variables as expected. Reasons for the support or lack thereof of hypotheses are discussed as well as results of additional analyses. Implications for research and practice are also discussed along with some suggestions for future studies.

The culture of women in tech: An unsuitable space for a woman,"Hardey, Mariann","This book is located within work in sociology, feminism, gender studies, and labour and occupational studies on the significance of professional identity in shaping roles and responsibilities—and notably the impact of lack of workplace diversity in tech. It examines the impact of masculine tech culture on contemporary conditions of work and professional training in tech. As a consequence, it considers the importance of and need for how gender has been, and continues to be, pivotal to interpretations of work and socio-tech culture incentivising new global policies for equality to combat 'difference' and to make adjustments to the lack of workplace diversity. It considers how gender has brought women's perspectives to bear on tech culture; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education; and training and regulation. The work is based on primary research carried out at global tech clusters in the UK, the US and East Asia to examine the rise of entrepreneurial work and leadership and the contemporary urban setting of tech culture. The book explores how tech workers articulate their place within the workforce and experience the spaces of tech clusters—often known as tech cities. Finally, this is an opportunity to examine how the lack of diversity in STEM and across global tech clusters has been brought to public attention, and how popular labels such as 'women in tech' have been acknowledged, celebrated, questioned, resisted and approved. This book is intended as an interdisciplinary contribution to the broader, ongoing attention that is being given to the lack of diversity in STEM and in tech industries. It invites readers to consider how the label 'women in tech' may be damaging to self-determining communities for equality and gives a fuller account of the points of activism achieved from within and outside of the tech sector.

The experience of African American women of implicit bias and receiving equal remuneration and motivation in workplace settings,"Baraka, Niya","This study addressed the problem of African American women and their experiences of implicit bias in the workplace impacting their motivation and their ability to receive equal remuneration. Women of African descent have been subjected to biases both implicit and explicit since the 17th centure and their arrival in the United States. This qualitative narrative research study provided an understanding of the perceived experience of implicit bias by African American women in their workplaces having an impact on their remuneration and motivation. The sample included 25 African American women between the ages of 20-65 working in a corporate setting for at least for 1 year and making less than 1 million dollars per year. The conceptual framework used was the theory of implicit social cognition which states a person acts in a certain manner in social settings because of unconscious mental patterns influenced by the attitudes, stereotypes, self-esteem, and their own past experiences in other similar social settings. The research questions that guided this research were, what is the experience of African American women with implicit bias and equal remuneration in the workplace, and what is the experience of African American women with implicit bias and their motivation in the workplace. Participants' individual stories were explored with a narrative inquiry design using 17 semi-structured openended questions. Data were collected from recorded individual zoom or telephone interviews and analyzed using NVivo software to identify themes. Findings showed that participants perceived they experienced implicit bias in their workplaces and that their ability to received equal remuneration and their motivation levels were negatively impacted. Recommendations include in-depth trainings within workplaces for the identification of individual cultural biases, giving employees a fair and equal chance for promotion and remuneration, company awareness of implicit and explicit bias towards minorities, and African American women in specific. Future research should focus on specific age groups of women to increase transferability.

"Threatened academic professional identities: Gender dynamics, workplace conditions and ‘unconscious complicity’","Boukeffa, Fatima Zohra","The main aim of this thesis is to investigate the aspects affecting the academic professional identities of ten full-time women academics working at an Algerian university. Significantly,the study shows that their academic professional identities appear to be threatened by either all or some of the following dimensions: a) gender dynamics; b) workplace conditions; and c)their 'unconscious complicity'.Regarding the gender dynamics, this thesis demonstrates that there exists an inconsistency between the women academics' own positioning in academia and that of society. Society implies the family and/or the broader community -acquaintances, neighbours and other individuals outside the networking circles. In their accounts, women academics define themselves as teachers-researchers ['enseignants-chercheurs']. Research represents the preparation preceding their teaching tasks, especially when they are assigned a new module that goes beyond their field of expertise. It also refers to scholarly publications such as books and journal articles. As for society, data evidence, interestingly, shows that society perceives academic work as suitable for women. This prevalent narrative is underpinned by two main assumptions. First, it confuses academic flexibility – the ability to work anywhere – with free time; hence, it only recognises women academics' nine or twelve teaching hours. Second, it, surprisingly, depicts the university setting as a space wherein women-men interactions are very limited, given that women academics spend most of their time between the classroom walls with their students. Although many women academics acknowledged the existence of such a discourse, only a few of them shared their experiences of how they were threatened by it, mainly when their partners and in-laws seemed to embrace it and, consequently, hindered women academics' tasks beyond the workplace.Workplace conditions represent another source of threat. Women academics demonstrated that they were operating in inadequate and unsupportive conditions, some of which were the consequence of a forced relocation to a faculty wherein they were not the owners. These challenges barely enabled them to perform their teaching duties in situ. Other practices, particularly in relation to research and professional development, were not institutionally supported. These challenging conditions led women academics to teach and leave. Interestingly, beyond the 'teach and leave' phenomenon, women academics showed that they were not weakened by the unsupportive working conditions. They, therefore, engaged in autonomous forms of professional development in order to enact their academic professional identities as 'teachers-researchers'. These practices, however, were limited and individualistic. More importantly, they reflected an 'unconscious complicity' that did not help them change the status quo at the workplace and reinforced the gendered discourse revolving around women's role in academia.Data was ethnographically collected over a period of three months at an Algerian university, specifically an English Department, using observations, semi-structured interviews, and informal conversations. It involved ten women academics as the main respondents, and other faculty members – a male librarian, a male academic, a group of female students and the female Head of the English Department. Their accounts added richness and depth to the enquiry.

Using a systems approach to creating equitable educational environments for gender and sexually diverse families,"Herbstrith, Julie C.","This chapter uses the ecological systems perspective to translate basic science into interventions and practices in K–12 schools that support gender and sexually diverse (GSD) families. Specifically, it addresses systems level issues that families headed by GSD parents face, including educators' lack of knowledge about GSD communities, school climate with elements of heteronormativity as well as cisnormativity, and prejudice directed against GSD families. The chapter describes evidence-based strategies that have been found to reduce prejudice and how these strategies can be applied to better support GSD families. The three interventions identified as effective at addressing those issues in other settings are: providing GSD multicultural education, invoking social norms, and promoting intergroup contact. Each intervention has the potential to effect systems level change in schools so that GSD parents and their children are afforded an equitable learning environment in which they feel included and affirmed.

Women rising: Internal facilitators to lead from the top,"Warrell, Margaret Mary","Growing recognition of the benefits of gender diversity within organizations has spawned initiatives designed to support the advancement of women in leadership. Yet, despite these efforts, there is still a paucity of women at the higher echelons of leadership in all spheres of business, education, and government in most countries across the globe. General consensus exists that external barriers, such as gendered organizational systems and agentic leadership norms, create an invisible barrier – a 'glass ceiling' that stymies female advancement and gender equity at top tables. However, less consensus exists as to what extent, if any, internal barriers at the individual level contribute to the 'leaky pipeline' of female progression or what factors distinguish those minority of women who manage to defy the odds to rise to the top in their professional domains. This dissertation provides a critical analysis of research and theories about the intra-personal barriers that may be creating an internal psychological glass cage for women and, using a qualitative method with narrative analysis, identifies internal facilitators that enable women to overcome them within multinational organizations. It concluded that while systemic factors are a barrier for women in leadership, there were seven distinguishing psychological factors that facilitate women to overcome them and exercise leadership at the highest level.

"You, me, or her: Leaders’ perceptions of responsibility for increasing gender diversity in STEM departments","McClelland, Sara I.; Holland, Kathryn J.","We examined how university leaders described what and who needed to change in order to increase the representation of female faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) departments. Thirty-one (28 men and 3 women) STEM departmental chairs and deans at a large, public university participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants’ descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women’s attitudes and their 'choice' to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM. We argue that the dimensions of high and low responsibility are useful additions to discussions of leadership, workplace diversity initiatives, and gender equity more broadly. To this end, we provide several methodological tools to examine these subtle, yet essential, aspects of how diversity and change efforts are imagined and discussed.

Women experienced more harassment than men, which contributes to their higher intentions to leave academia through enhancing perceptions of a negative workplace climate (i.e., a less collaborative, fair, and inclusive climate) and lower job-related identification (i.e., believing in their ability to succeed as researchers).

How Inclusiveness of Learning Environment Mediates the Evolution of Engineering Students' Motivational Beliefs in a Two-Semester Introductory Physics Course Sequence,"Li, YQT; Singh, C","In this study, we focus on engineering students' motivational beliefs and course grades in a two-term college calculusbased introductory physics sequence (physics 1 and physics 2). We investigated how engineering students' perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment (including their sense of belonging, perceived effectiveness of peer interaction and perceived recognition) predicts their physics course grades and motivational beliefs including self-efficacy, interest, overall physics identity, and overall engineering identity. Using structural equation modeling, we find that students' perception of the inclusiveness of the learning environment statistically significantly predicts their physics grades and motivational beliefs. In particular, students' engineering identity is statistically significantly predicted by engineering students' perception of how they were recognized as a physics person.

"Gender differences in organizational fairness, diversity and inclusion: the mediating role of psychological safety in affective commitment","Pinho, M; Colston, B","PurposeThe current study explores the role of social psychological factors on organizational commitment. It examined the relationships between organizational fairness, inclusion, diversity, sexism, psychological safety and affective commitment.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a cross-sectional survey method where data were collected from staff across six higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. A total of 416 responses were collected and the data were analyzed by employing independent sample t-tests to explore gender differences regarding organizational diversity, inclusion, fairness, sexism, psychological safety and affective commitment. The mediating role of psychological safety in the effects of organizational diversity, fairness, inclusion and sexism on staff's commitment to the organization was evaluated through a series of simple mediation models. Finally, the mediated effect of organizational social psychological factors on affective commitment through psychological safety, moderated by gender was tested.FindingsAs hypothesized, men had higher perceptions of organizational inclusion and diversity and viewed their organization as less sexist. Psychological safety mediated the positive effects of organizational diversity, fairness, inclusion and sexism on staff's affective commitment to the organization. Organizational diversity and sexism played a bigger part in how women evaluate their organizational environment as safe to take risks and be themselves and consequently on how they commit to the organization. On the other hand, organizational fairness and inclusion seem more closely tied to men's evaluation of their organization as safe to be themselves and consequently stronger commitment.Originality/valueThe findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms that shape affective commitment, that can lead to more inclusive work environments and contribute to systemic change in the Higher Education context.",2024,,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,,,,WOS:001314970400001,10.1108/EDI-08-2023-0284,,#188,Pinho 2024,"",""
Promoting Inclusive Environments: In-group Organizational Endorsement as a Tool to Increase Feelings of Identity-Safety among Black Women,"Burrows, D; Pietri, ES; Johnson, IR; Ashburn-Nardo, L","Black women face unique and harmful biases because of their intersecting and multiple marginalized identities, which are different from those experienced by Black men and White women (Crenshaw in s. Cal. l. Rev., 65, 1467., 1991). As organizations work to create more inclusive environments for minoritized employees, it is important to test effective messaging and identity-safe cues (i.e., cues that enhance feelings of identity acceptance) for Black women. In the current research, we investigate a new identity-safe cue - in-group organizational endorsement. This technique involves two components: (a) learning about the successful experiences of a former Black female employee and (b) a persuasive message asserting that out-group employees can be supportive role models and mentors within the organization. In a pilot experiment (N = 182) and Study 1 (N = 236), Black female participants were more likely to believe role models and mentors can have different identities, to anticipate more identity-safety, and to have higher attraction to an organization that was endorsed by a former Black female employee compared to a White woman employee. Study 2 (N = 214) further demonstrated that in-group organizational endorsement was effective among Black female students early in their college career. Relative to a control group, Black female students in their 1(st) - 3(rd) year who received the in-group endorsement intervention indicated higher identity-safety at their university and were more likely to pursue professional interactions with out-group members. For institutions that are actively working to promote inclusivity and pro-diversity norms among their employees, in-group organizational endorsement is one effective identity-safety signal for communicating such environments.",2022,,SEX ROLES,86,1-2,67-88,WOS:000719294400001,10.1007/s11199-021-01253-2,,#189,Burrows 2022,"",""
Industrial engineering practice: Process approach for equity and inclusion culture,"Ruiz-Cantisani, MI; Rincon-Flores, EG; Rodriguez, GC; Lopez-Ruiz, DI","In recent years, diversity, inclusion, and gender equity have gained relevance in society, and universities as educators have integrated it as an initiative to develop in their culture. As part of strengthening this culture a private university with 26 campuses in Mexico develops initiatives that support this culture. This study shares the common roadmap and the lessons learned from the use of the process approach (fundamental approach of industrial engineering area) in two of these programs: the first one is an institutional initiative linked to the recognition of human dignity, which impacts all its campuses, and the second is a program that emerges from women engineering students to mentor vulnerable public high school women, which inspires their growth as women and presents STEM careers as an opportunity for their professional growth. The comparison of both processes and the learning is done in its stages: (1) design of the plan, (2) definition of the stakeholders, (3) instruments used, (4) design of the operation model, (5) documentation and (6) validation. The findings are related to the reasons for the need to generate operation models for the programs: quality and warmth solid initiatives offered on different campuses, continuous improvement process and to create and strengthen an impact on the culture of equity, inclusion and diversity. Students and professors of the industrial engineering career are key players in the success of the design as well as stakeholder involvement. Also, the development of instruments (interviews, focus groups, or participatory meetings), and the feedback from the main users, should be present throughout the whole process.

Using faultline theory (Lau and Murnighan, 1998) as a foundation, we hypothesized that women in STEM have more negative perceptions of their departmental diversity climate, have more negatively discrepant perceptions of their departmental diversity climate, and that this greater perceptual discrepancy relates to higher turnover intentions compared to men in STEM fields and compared to women and men in non-STEM fields. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 737 (62% male, 86% White) faculty who completed an online faculty climate survey. The hypotheses were fully supported.

Antecedents and Consequences of Perceived Inclusion in Academia,"Innstrand, ST; Grodal, K","A diversified workforce is a current trend in organizations today. The present paper illuminates the antecedents, consequences, and potential gender differences of a rather new concept salient to contemporary work life, namely, perceived inclusion. The hypothesized relationships were tested in a sample of academics and faculty staff at different higher education institutions in Norway (n = 12,170). Structural equation modeling analyses supported hypotheses that empowering leadership and social support from the leader (but not the fairness) are positively related to perceived inclusion. Further, perceived inclusion is positively related to organizational commitment, work engagement, and work-home facilitation and negatively related to work-home conflict. By utilizing multigroup analyses, we found support for the hypothesis that compared to women, men perceive their organization as more inclusive. However, in contrast to what was hypothesized, the proposed relationships in the model were stronger for men than women, suggesting that not only do men perceive their work environment as more inclusive, but their perception of inclusion is also more strongly related to beneficial outcomes for the organization.

Promoting Game Jams and Hackathons as more Women-inclusive Environments for Informal Learning,"IEEE; Paganini, L; Ferraz, C; Gama, K; Alves, C","Hackathons and game jams are informal venues to engage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students in practical learning and nurturing interdisciplinary competencies (e.g., programming, design, communication). They also offer rich opportunities for networking and boosting the employability of participants. However, due to the not very inclusive culture created around them, these events may become hostile places for women. The low participation of women in hackathons and game jams may result in a loss of opportunity for them to improve their skills or to find jobs. Little is known about the motivations and perceptions of women participating in hackathons and game jams. We aimed at understanding (1) what are the typical gender-related problems women face in hackathons and game jams and how the perspective of men differ in regards to that problem; (2) how women perceive their motivations and their experience when participating in such events; and (3) what deters some women from participating. In this paper, we surveyed 211 participants of 8 events of this nature targeting higher education students with multidisciplinary backgrounds: 2 game jams (one of them women-focused) and 6 hackathons (one of them women-focused). Additionally, we applied a survey to hear the voice of 47 women who never attended these events to understand their lack of motivation. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we compared the perspectives of men and women who participated in the studied hackathons and game jams. The qualitative data allowed us to investigate different experiences of women who reported discomfort in these events. As contributions of this paper, based on the collected data, we report different perspectives that men and women have about gender issues in these events and highlight the typical sexist behavior (bropriating, mansplaining, etc) of men participating in hackathons and game jams. Results showed that learning is the main motivation for both men and women to join these events. We also map the common reasons for women not being motivated to participate in these types of gatherings. Finally, we propose recommendations so that hackathons and game jams can increase gender equality. Our experience suggests these events, if well planned and executed, may become drivers to change attitudes and stereotypes regarding women in computing.

This research has tended to focus on experiences of social marginalization within STEM contexts such as exclusion and harassment, but LGBTQ persons may also face a myriad of career-related disadvantages that are likely tight-ly entwined with social marginalization. In this article we ask, do negative social dynamics in LGBTQ professionals' work environments foster professional disadvantages by LGBTQ status? Drawing on survey data from an insightful case of environmental scientists working in academic teams, we find that LGBTQ scientists were less likely to experience professional respect, had more frequent encounters with negative authorship practices, and were less likely to experience positive career mentoring than their peers. LGBTQ scientists were less likely than cisgender-heterosexual scientists to experience positive interpersonal climates in their teams (in the form of procedural justice and inclusivity) and we find that these more negative team climate experiences significantly mediated (i.e., helped account for) LGBTQ status differences along two of the three professional outcomes (professional respect and authorship experiences). These findings underscore the importance of accounting for how negative social environments for LGBTQ STEM professionals can translate into negative professional outcomes.

The REI was employed on self-reported demographic data, collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges, from U.S. medical school faculty in 2017, to make pairwise rank comparisons of the professoriate by demographic characteristics and department. Overall results indicated that women did not attain parity at any pairwise rank comparison, while men were above parity at all ranks. Similar results were observed across all departments surveyed: women in the basic sciences had REIs closest to parity, women in pediatrics had the highest representation but had REIs that were further from parity than REIs in the basic sciences, and women in surgery demonstrated the lowest REIs. Nationally, REIs were below 1.00 for all racial/ethnic group rank comparisons except for White and, in one case, multiple-race non-Hispanic/Latinx. Across all analyzed departments, Black/African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and multiple-race Hispanic/Latinx faculty had REIs below parity at all ranks except in 2 cases. In a comparison of 2017 and 2007 data, REIs across both race/ethnicity and gender were lower in 2007 for nearly all groups. REI analyses can highlight inequities in faculty rank that may be masked when using aggregate faculty proportions, which do not account for rank. The REI provides AMCs with a new tool to better analyze institutional data to inform efforts to increase parity across all faculty ranks.",2020,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,95,12,1844-1852,WOS:000592283100028,10.1097/ACM.0000000000003720,,#211,Fassiotto 2020,"",""
PEER-ASSISTED LEARNING AS FIRST-YEAR STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND RETENTION INTERVENTION: THE IMPACT ON ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE,"Byl, E; Struyven, K; Jacquet, W; Abelshausen, B; Meurs, P; Vanwing, T; Engels, N; Lombaerts, K","Decades of research in higher education demonstrate a strong linkage of student integration to academic achievement and student commitment: two essential impact variables on the decision of leaving the university. Creating and sustaining networks through efforts such as peer mentoring programs; social support group intervention programs, or group interventions for students who may present with particular challenges, such as transition to encourage peer support is being recognised as equally important as academic support structures in educational institutions. Although studies shows PAL effectiveness for students' academic commitment and learning achievement research that examines the impact of a PAL in which it is applied to both socio-psychological and academic content, aligned with students' first-year university context and needs is missing. To this end, the present study builds upon an innovative holistic Integrated PAL program (iPAL) that includes several PAL approaches (peer mentoring, peer coaching, peer tutoring), as well as pre-induction social networking community building and orienting activities. iPAL was designed by using appreciative inquiry and with the intention to bridge the gap between academic and social integration, and equip students with the informal support, feedback and involvement needed to face the remaining university years with success. We examined the statistical relation between iPAL and (i) academic performance (AP), and cognitive (CC), emotional (EC), and behavioral commitment (BC). Data analysis was based on self-conducted survey assignments of 291 full-time first-year students enrolled in the faculty of Psychology and Educational Science at an Urban Flemish University in the capital of Belgium, Brussels. The Commitment Attitude Scale (3CAS) was used to assess the degree of commitment to the study and both GPA and weighted GPA was used to assess grade performance. Furthermore, by disaggregating our data on the basis of gender and age differences, this study wants to contribute to the empirical work of researchers that focuses on potential differences among subgroups of the first-year student population. Comparing the differences of iPAL participation for both age and gender subgroups, results clearly show that iPAL is most efficient for the younger and female subgroup in enhancing academic performance and cognitive, emotional and behavioral commitment. Furthermore, with regards to student organizational commitment, also interesting findings appeared: male participants significantly have a higher level of cognitive commitment and emotional commitment, while female participants significantly have higher levels of emotional commitment and behavioral commitment. In the light of institutional governments with limited budgets, this cost-effective PAL program design and planning address social sustainability most effectively and contribute to the creation of social equality and inclusion in university environments.",2016,,"ICERI2016: 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION",,,4318-4325,WOS:000417330204058,,,#213,Byl 2016,"",""
Inclusive Teaching.,Dewsbury B; Brame CJ,"Over the past two decades, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty have been striving to make their teaching practices more inclusive and welcoming to the variety of students who enter college. However, many STEM faculty, even those at teaching-focused institutions, have been educated in a traditional environment that emphasizes research and may not include classroom teaching. This can produce a deficit in training that leaves many STEM faculty feeling uncertain about inclusive teaching practices and their essential undergirding principles. This essay describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide ( https://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/inclusive-teaching ) intended to help fill this gap, serving as a resource for science faculty as they work to become more inclusive, particular with regard to differences in race, ethnicity, and gender. The guide describes the importance of developing self-awareness and empathy for students as a precursor to considering classroom practices. It also explores the role of classroom climate before turning to pedagogical choices that can support students' sense of belonging, competence, and interest in the course. Finally, the guide suggests that true inclusivity is a community effort and that instructors should leverage local and national networks to maximize student learning and inclusion. Each of these essential points is supported by summaries of and links to articles that can inform these choices. The guide also includes an instructor checklist that offers a concise summary of key points with actionable steps that can guide instructors as they work toward a more inclusive practice. We hope that the guide will provide value for both faculty who are just beginning to consider how to change their teaching practices and faculty seeking to enrich their current efforts.",2019,Jun,CBE Life Sci Educ,18,2,fe2,,10.1187/cbe.19-01-0021,31025917,#214,Dewsbury 2019,"",""

Hypertension: Are Current Guidelines Inclusive of Sex and Gender?,Griffin BL; Bolch CA; Bourjeily G; Madsen TE; Hasnain M; McGregor AJ; Merhi BO; Pratt-Chapman ML; Romano M; Trott J; Tong I,"Background: Hypertension (HTN) accounts for one in five deaths of American women. Major societies worldwide aim to make evidence-based recommendations for HTN management. Sex- or gender-based differences exist in epidemiology and management of HTN; in this study, we aimed to assess sex- and gender-based language in major society guidelines. Materials and Methods: We reviewed HTN guidelines from four societies: the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8). We quantified the sex- and gender-based medicine (SGBM) content by word count in each guideline as well as identified the gender of guideline authors. Results: Two of the four HTN guidelines (ACC, ESC) included SGBM content. Of these two guidelines, there were variations in the quantity and depth of content coverage. Pregnancy had the highest word count found in both guidelines (422 words in ACC and 1,523 words in ESC), which represented 2.45% and 3.04% of the total words in each guideline, respectively. There was minimal coverage, if any, of any other life periods. The number of women authors did not impact the SGBM content within a given guideline. Conclusions: Current HTN management guidelines do not provide optimal guidance on sex- and gender-based differences. Inclusion of sex, gender identity, hormone therapy, pregnancy and lactation status, menopause, and advanced age in future research will be critical to bridge the current evidence gap.

The time is now: addressing implicit bias in obstetrics and gynecology education.,Royce CS; Morgan HK; Baecher-Lind L; Cox S; Everett EN; Fleming A; Graziano SC; Sims SM; Morosky C; Sutton J; Sonn T,"Obstetrician-gynecologists can improve the learning environment and patient care by addressing implicit bias. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that racial and gender-based discrimination is woven into medical education, formal curricula, patient-provider-trainee interactions in the clinical workspace, and all aspects of learner assessment. Implicit bias negatively affects learners in every space. Strategies to address implicit bias at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural level to improve the well-being of learners and patients are needed. The authors review an approach to addressing implicit bias in obstetrics and gynecology education, which includes: (1) curricular design using an educational framework of antiracism and social justice theories, (2) bias awareness and management pedagogy throughout the curriculum, (3) elimination of stereotypical patient descriptions from syllabi and examination questions, and (4) critical review of epidemiology and evidence-based medicine for underlying assumptions based on discriminatory practices or structural racism that unintentionally reinforce stereotypes and bias. The movement toward competency-based medical education and holistic evaluations may result in decreased bias in learner assessment. Educators may wish to monitor grades and narratives for bias as a form of continuous educational equity improvement.

Creating an Inclusive Urology Practice.,Gonzalez G; Anger J,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients seeking urologic care come from diverse backgrounds. Therefore, clinics should strive for inclusivity to make all patients feel comfortable seeing a urologist. This review aims to outline and analyze literature relevant to the care of LGTBQIA+ (lesbian, gay, transgender/transexual, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual/allies, nonbinary/genderqueer +), racial and ethnic minorities, those who have disabilities, and those with a high body mass index (BMI). Although this review article presents the care of diverse communities separately, there is an overlap of the various social axes influencing healthcare outcomes. Healthcare workers should be open-minded to learning about evolving community needs. RECENT FINDINGS: Creating a safe space for LGTBQIA+ requires understanding terminology, awareness of community-specific challenges and health risks, and changing heteronormative behaviors built into medicine. Specific clinical care delivery structural processes and patient-physician-centered practices can make a clinic welcoming for patients from underrepresented backgrounds and with disabilities. BMI surgical requirements may pose barriers to care, and if implemented, there should be assistance to reach specified weight goals.

Physician gender as a source of implicit bias affecting clinical decision-making processes: a scoping review.,Champagne-Langabeer T; Hedges AL,"BACKGROUND: The demographic profile of practicing physicians is changing as more female medical students are graduating and practicing in the field. While the education received may not differ by gender, studies have shown that physician practice outcomes vary by provider gender. Various factors could contribute to these differences, including culture and explicit biases which may lead to implicit bias. This study aims to identify the available evidence of gender-based implicit bias throughout the delivery process of medicine. METHODS: This scoping review evaluated published literature within the PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and BioMed Central databases pertaining to physician's gender as a factor in the delivery of medicine. Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage methodology was used as a framework and reported using the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Searches occurred between May 2020 and June 2020, and the timeframe was not limited. Included articles had gender as a factor in the delivery of medicine and implicit bias. Articles were excluded if they did not include the gender of the physician. After screening by reviewers and a medical librarian, study characteristics were charted and analyzed. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 2420 records. After screening, 162 of the records were selected based on title and keyword relevance. After additional screening, 15 records were ultimately included in the review based on full-text evaluation. Records were organized into sub-topics post hoc focused on clinical qualities, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes. CONCLUSION: This scoping review found that gender-based implicit bias may be inadvertently acquired from culture and education. Although implicit bias is highly researched, much of the current literature focuses on the gender of the patient. This study found important gaps in the available literature regarding race and gender of the physician. Further studies could explore outcome differences between recent graduates and career physicians, for both female and male physicians.",2021,Mar,BMC Med Educ,21,1,171,,10.1186/s12909-021-02601-2,33740973,#220,Champagne-Langabeer 2021,"",""
Brief online implicit bias education increases bias awareness among clinical teaching faculty.,Sabin J; Guenther G; Ornelas IJ; Patterson DG; Andrilla CHA; Morales L; Gurjal K; Frogner BK,"PROBLEM AND PURPOSE: Healthcare provider implicit bias influences the learning environment and patient care. Bias awareness is one of the key elements to be included in implicit bias education. Research on education enhancing bias awareness is limited. Bias awareness can motivate behavior change. The objective was to evaluate whether exposure to a brief online course, Implicit Bias in the Clinical and Learning Environment, increased bias awareness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The course included the history of racism in medicine, social determinants of health, implicit bias in healthcare, and strategies to reduce the impact of implicit bias in clinical care and teaching. A sample of U.S. academic family, internal, and emergency medicine providers were recruited into the study from August to December 2019. Measures of provider implicit and explicit bias, personal and practice characteristics, and pre-post-bias awareness measures were collected. RESULTS: Of 111 participants, 78 (70%) were female, 81 (73%) were White, and 63 (57%) were MDs. Providers held moderate implicit pro-White bias on the Race IAT (Cohen's d = 0.68) and strong implicit stereotypes associating males rather than females with 'career' on the Gender-Career IAT (Cohen's d = 1.15). Overall, providers held no explicit race bias (Cohen's d = 0.05). Providers reported moderate explicit male-career (Cohen's d = 0.68) and strong female-family stereotype (Cohen's d = 0.83). A statistically significant increase in bias awareness was found after exposure to the course (p = 0.03). Provider implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics were not associated with an increase in bias awareness.

We used descriptive statistics to analyze the Likert-type survey responses and used standard IAT analysis methods. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that were associated with implicit bias. We conducted a subgroup analysis of study sites involved in a multi-site intervention study to determine if responses were different in this group. RESULTS: Overall, 74% of the programs had at least one respondent. Out of 14,234 eligible, 1634 respondents completed the survey (11.5%). Of the five sites enrolled in the intervention study, 244 of 359 eligible residents completed the survey (68%). Male residents had a mean IAT score of 0.31 (SD 0.23) and females 0.14 (SD 0.24), both favoring males in leadership roles and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). IAT scores did not differ by postgraduate year (PGY). Multivariable analysis of IAT score and participant demographics confirmed a significant association between female gender and lower IAT score. Explicit bias favoring males in leadership roles was associated with increased implicit bias favoring males in leadership roles (r = 0.1 p < 0.001).

Assessment of Implicit Gender Bias During Evaluation of Procedural Competency Among Emergency Medicine Residents.,See A; Pallaci M; Aluisio AR; Beck-Esmay J; Menchine M; Weinstock M; Lam CN; Riddell J,"IMPORTANCE: Gender disparities exist throughout medicine. Recent studies have highlighted an attainment gap between male and female residents in performance evaluations on Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones. Because of difficulties in blinding evaluators to gender, it remains unclear whether these observed disparities are because of implicit bias or other causes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude of implicit gender bias in assessments of procedural competency in emergency medicine residents and whether the gender of the evaluator is associated with identified implicit gender bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 2018 to 2020 in which emergency medicine residency faculty assessed procedural competency by evaluating videos of residents performing 3 procedures in a simulated environment. They were blinded to the intent of the study. Proceduralists were filmed performing each procedure from 2 different viewpoints simultaneously by 2 different cameras. One was a gender-blinded (ie, hands-only) view, and the other a wide-angled gender-evident (ie, whole-body) view. The faculty evaluators viewed videos in a random order and assessed procedural competency on a global rating scale with extensive validity evidence for the evaluation of video-recorded procedural performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based on gender. The secondary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluations based on the gender of the evaluator. RESULTS: Fifty-one faculty evaluators enrolled from 19 states, with 22 male participants (43.1%), 29 female participants (56.9%), and a mean (SD) age of 37 (6.4) years.

Implicit Gender Bias in Third-Year Surgery Clerkship MSPE Narratives.,Chen S; Beck Dallaghan GL; Shaheen A,"OBJECTIVE: To assess implicit gender bias in surgery clerkship evaluations of third-year medical students at a large, academic hospital in the Southeast. METHODS: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine has multiple branch campuses where students can complete their surgical clerkship including 1 large academic center, 1 hybrid academic and community-based practice, and 3 community-based hospitals. All residents and faculty evaluations of medical students who completed the surgery clerkship from March 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019 were analyzed. Evaluations were anonymized and names and pronouns were removed to mitigate evaluator bias. A word dictionary was created guided by previous literature and categorized descriptive adjectives into 4 categories: ability, grindstone, standout, and personality traits. Adjectives used to describe students, and references to the student using gendered pronouns or gender-fair language were coded and quantified as percentage of total evaluation word content. These percentages were compared between male and female students. A subsequent analysis was completed to assess the effects of gendered pronouns on linguistic patterns. RESULTS: A total of 583 evaluations from the surgery clerkship were available for 183 students (51.9% female, 48.1% male). When gender-fair language was used, there was no difference in the adjectives used to describe female and male students. Male evaluators were more likely to use female gendered pronouns compared to male gendered pronouns (3.1% vs 2.3%, p = 0.028). When gendered pronouns were present, evaluations of female students were more likely to contain grindstone adjectives but less likely to contain standout terms compared to evaluations of male students (4.4% vs 2.8%, p = 0.006; 0.6% vs 1.3%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: For students who have completed their surgical clerkship, the language patterns in evaluations differ between female students and male students.

In recent years the diversity of those participating in these fields, particularly the participation of women, has improved and there are significantly more women entering careers and studying science, engineering, and medicine than ever before. However, as women increasingly enter these fields they face biases and barriers and it is not surprising that sexual harassment is one of these barriers. Over thirty years the incidence of sexual harassment in different industries has held steady, yet now more women are in the workforce and in academia, and in the fields of science, engineering, and medicine (as students and faculty) and so more women are experiencing sexual harassment as they work and learn. Over the last several years, revelations of the sexual harassment experienced by women in the workplace and in academic settings have raised urgent questions about the specific impact of this discriminatory behavior on women and the extent to which it is limiting their careers. Sexual Harassment of Women explores the influence of sexual harassment in academia on the career advancement of women in the scientific, technical, and medical workforce. This report reviews the research on the extent to which women in the fields of science, engineering, and medicine are victimized by sexual harassment and examines the existing information on the extent to which sexual harassment in academia negatively impacts the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women pursuing scientific, engineering, technical, and medical careers.

SGM trainees and physicians also face challenges, including derogatory comments, humiliation, harassment, fear of being ostracized, and residency/job placement discrimination. These inequities are not mutually exclusive to either patients or providers; instead, they are intertwined parts of a persistent, negative culture in medicine toward SGM individuals.In this Perspective, the authors argue that SGM physicians must lead this charge for equality by fostering diversity and inclusion in medicine. They posit that academic medicine can accomplish this goal by (1) modernizing research on the physician workforce, (2) implementing new policies and programs to promote safe and supportive training and practice environments, and (3) developing recruitment practices to ensure a diverse, competent physician workforce that includes SGM individuals.These efforts will have an immediate impact by identifying and empowering new leaders to address SGM health care reform, creating diverse training environments that promote cultural competency, and aligning medicine with other professional fields (e.g., business, law) that already are working toward these goals. By tackling the inequities that SGM providers face, academic medicine can normalize sexual and gender identity disclosure and promote a welcoming, supportive environment for everyone in medicine, including patients.",2015,May,Acad Med,90,5,574-80,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000000656,25650825,#233,Mansh 2015,"",""
Chilly climate perceived by female engineering undergraduates: an exploratory study using concept mapping.,Kim T; Kim D,"INTRODUCTION: Women still being a minority in engineering majors, they are reported to face discriminatory treatment in a collegiate environment. ""Chilly climate,"" referring to such a sexist environment, may have a negative impact on women's mental health, academics, and careers. But, what exactly is it that female students in engineering perceive as chilly, and how chilly is it? This study aimed to explore the chilly campus climate perceived by female undergraduate engineering students in South Korea using the concept mapping method. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 participants enrolled for more than four semesters at four-year coeducational universities. After extracting 52 representative statements, the participants were asked to classify them according to content similarity and rate the influence of each statement on their perception of the chilly climate. For concept mapping analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis (ALSCAL), hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method), and non-hierarchical cluster analysis (K-means method) were performed. RESULTS: Fifty-two statements were extracted under the following four clusters: (i) ""Exclusion and alienation inherent in the culture (Cluster 1),"" (ii) ""Sexual objectification and lack of gender sensitivity (Cluster 2),"" (iii) ""Male-centered academic situations (Cluster 3),"" and (iv) ""Prejudice and generalization (Cluster 4)."" A concept map was two-dimensional: an X-axis named ""context dimension,"" with ""task: academic"" and ""non-task: social"" at both ends, and a Y-axis named ""sexism dimension"", having ""explicit"" and ""implicit"" at both ends. The order of higher scores in the influence rating is as follows: Cluster 2, Cluster 3, Cluster 1, and Cluster 4. DISCUSSION: This study is significant because it conceptualizes the subjective experience of minorities in a collegiate environment and provides influence rating results for prioritized measures. The findings will be helpful in formulating educational policies, psychological counseling, and social advocacy activities. Future research should target larger populations, and cover more diverse cultures, majors, and age groups.",2023,,Front Psychol,14,,1145795,,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1145795,37333590,#234,Kim 2023,"",""
An analysis of unconscious gender bias in academic texts by means of a decision algorithm.,Orgeira-Crespo P; Míguez-Álvarez C; Cuevas-Alonso M; Rivo-López E,"Inclusive language focuses on using the vocabulary to avoid exclusion or discrimination, specially referred to gender. The task of finding gender bias in written documents must be performed manually, and it is a time-consuming process. Consequently, studying the usage of non-inclusive language on a document, and the impact of different document properties (such as author gender, date of presentation, etc.) on how many non-inclusive instances are found, is quite difficult or even impossible for big datasets. This research analyzes the gender bias in academic texts by analyzing a study corpus of more than 12,000 million words obtained from more than one hundred thousand doctoral theses from Spanish universities. For this purpose, an automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed. The algorithm identified information patterns using a CNN (convolutional neural network) by the creation of a vector representation of the sentences. The results showed evidence that there was a greater bias as the age of the authors increased, who were more likely to use non-inclusive terms; it was concluded that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men, and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger. The results showed evidence that the age of the authors increased discrimination, with men being more likely to use non-inclusive terms (up to an index of 23.12), showing that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men in all age ranges (with an average of 14.99), and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger (falling down to 13.07). In terms of field of knowledge, the humanities are the most biased (20.97), discarding the subgroup of Linguistics, which has the least bias at all levels (9.90), and the field of science and engineering, which also have the least influence (13.46). Those results support the assumption that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues: otherwise, it would not depend on the field, age, gender, and would occur in any field in the same proportion. The innovation provided by this research lies mainly in the ability to detect, within a textual document in Spanish, whether the use of language can be considered non-inclusive, based on a CNN that has been trained in the context of the doctoral thesis. A significant number of documents have been used, using all accessible doctoral theses from Spanish universities of the last 40 years; this dataset is only manageable by data mining systems, so that the training allows identifying the terms within the context effectively and compiling them in a novel dictionary of non-inclusive terms.",2021,,PLoS One,16,9,e0257903,,10.1371/journal.pone.0257903,34591923,#235,Orgeira-Crespo 2021,"",""
High prevalence of medical conditions and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours in women with PCOS during preconception: findings from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.,Tay CT; Loxton D; Bahri Khomami M; Teede H; Harrison CL; Joham AE,"STUDY QUESTION: What are the pre-existing medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours of women with and without PCOS during the preconception period? SUMMARY ANSWER: During the preconception period, medical conditions of obesity, depression, anxiety, and a history of infertility were more highly prevalent in women with than without PCOS, and more women with than without PCOS were engaged in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with PCOS are predisposed to infertility and pregnancy complications. Optimizing preconception medical health and lifestyle behaviours can improve maternal and pregnancy outcomes but, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the preconception medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours of women with PCOS. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE DURATION: This is a cross-sectional study on 942 women with PCOS and 7024 women without PCOS, aged 24-30 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health, an ongoing, national survey-based prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The current study analysed self-reported data from Survey 6 collected in 2019 of the cohort of women born between 1989 and 1995. Explored outcomes included BMI, pre-existing medical conditions, and modifiable lifestyle behaviours, including smoking, recreational drug use, alcohol intake, and physical activity level, during the preconception period. Differences between subgroups were tested using Student's t-test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The associations of pregnancy intention with medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours were examined using logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Obesity, depression, anxiety, and infertility were highly prevalent in women actively planning for pregnancy. Among women with PCOS, the prevalence of obesity was 47.02%, followed by depression at 32.70%, anxiety at 39.62%, and infertility at 47.17%. Conversely among women without PCOS, the corresponding prevalence was lower, at 22.33% for obesity, 18.98% for depression, 23.93% for anxiety, and 16.42% for infertility. In women actively planning for pregnancy, only those without PCOS demonstrated a lower prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours compared to non-planning women. The prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours was similar in women with PCOS regardless of their pregnancy intentions. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that only moderate/high stress with motherhood/children (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.31, 95% CI 1.60-6.85) and history of infertility (adjusted OR 9.67, 95% CI 5.02-18.64) were significantly associated with active pregnancy planning in women with PCOS. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The findings were based on self-reported data. The cohort of women surveyed may have a higher level of education than women in the community, therefore our findings may underestimate the true prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions and lifestyle challenges faced by the broader population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A higher proportion of women with than without PCOS had pre-existing medical conditions and engaged in potentially modifiable unhealthy lifestyle behaviours during preconception despite their risk for subfertility and pregnancy complications. Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in guiding this high-risk group of women during this period, offering counselling, education, and support for the adoption of healthy lifestyles to improve fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and intergenerational health.

Changing the Culture of Academic Medicine: Critical Mass or Critical Actors?,Helitzer DL; Newbill SL; Cardinali G; Morahan PS; Chang S; Magrane D,"PURPOSE: By 2006, women constituted 34% of academic medical faculty, reaching a critical mass. Theoretically, with critical mass, culture and policy supportive of gender equity should be evident. We explore whether having a critical mass of women transforms institutional culture and organizational change. METHODS: Career development program participants were interviewed to elucidate their experiences in academic health centers (AHCs). Focus group discussions were held with institutional leaders to explore their perceptions about contemporary challenges related to gender and leadership. Content analysis of both data sources revealed points of convergence. Findings were interpreted using the theory of critical mass. RESULTS: Two nested domains emerged: the individual domain included the rewards and personal satisfaction of meaningful work, personal agency, tensions between cultural expectations of family and academic roles, and women's efforts to work for gender equity. The institutional domain depicted the sociocultural environment of AHCs that shaped women's experience, both personally and professionally, lack of institutional strategies to engage women in organizational initiatives, and the influence of one leader on women's ascent to leadership. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant evidence from this research demonstrates that the institutional barriers and sociocultural environment continue to be formidable obstacles confronting women, stalling the transformational effects expected from achieving a critical mass of women faculty. We conclude that the promise of critical mass as a turning point for women should be abandoned in favor of ""critical actor"" leaders, both women and men, who individually and collectively have the commitment and power to create gender-equitable cultures in AHCs.",2017,May,J Womens Health (Larchmt),26,5,540-548,,10.1089/jwh.2016.6019,28092473,#237,Helitzer 2017,"",""
Psyche Meets the Gatekeepers: Creating a More Humane Culture for Women in Medicine.,Flaherty SM; Misra M; Scott-Vernaglia SE; Taveras EM; Israel EJ,"In the Greek myth of Psyche and Eros, Psyche must fulfill four seemingly impossible tasks to achieve full consciousness before she can be reunited with her bridegroom, Eros. From early childhood, girls and women can encounter gender stereotyping, sexual harassment and assault, and other gender-related challenges. Although both men and women can face mistreatment in medical school, female students experience sexual harassment and sexual assault at higher rates than male students. In medical training and career advancement, women often face additional obstacles unrelated to the formal education of physicians, such as salary and promotional disparities, and lack of mentorship, sponsorship, or role models. The suicide rate for male physicians is nearly 1.5 times higher than the general population; for female physicians, it is more than twice as high. Parenthood can pose additional challenges for mothers and fathers early in their academic careers, and women are vastly underrepresented as they try to move past the ""gatekeepers"" into leadership roles. Using the framework of the Psyche and Eros myth to examine the trajectory of a female physician's career, this article provides insights into these challenges, as well as strategies to address some of these inequities, such as programs to support female promotion and leadership, expanded mentorship and mentor models, sponsorship opportunities, leadership accountability, implicit bias training, and others.

How is physicians' implicit prejudice against the obese and mentally ill moderated by specialty and experience?,FitzGerald C; Mumenthaler C; Berner D; Schindler M; Brosch T; Hurst S,"BACKGROUND: Implicit prejudice can lead to disparities in treatment. The effects of specialty and experience on implicit obesity and mental illness prejudice had not been explored. The main objective was to examine how specializing in psychiatry/general medicine and years of experience moderated implicit obesity and mental illness prejudice among Swiss physicians. Secondary outcomes included examining the malleability of implicit bias via two video interventions and a condition of cognitive load, correlations of implicit bias with responses to a clinical vignette, and correlations with explicit prejudice. METHODS: In stage 1, participants completed an online questionnaire including a clinical vignette. In stage 2, implicit prejudice pre- and post- intervention was tested using a 4 × 4 between-subject design including a control group. In stage 3, explicit prejudice was tested with feeling thermometers and participants were debriefed. Participants were 133 psychiatrists and internists working in Geneva, hospital-based and private practice. Implicit prejudice was assessed using a Weight IAT (Implicit Association Test) and a Mental Illness IAT. Explicit feelings towards the obese and the mentally ill were measured using Feeling Thermometers. A clinical vignette assessed the level of concern felt for a fictional patient under four conditions: control, obese, depression, obese and depression. Linear regression was conducted to test for association of gender, experience, and specialty with responses to vignettes, pre-intervention IATs and explicit attitudes, and to test for association of interventions (or control) with post-intervention IATs and explicit attitudes. Reported effect sizes were computed using Cohen's d. Two-tailed p < 0.05 was selected as the significance threshold. RESULTS: Compared to internists, psychiatrists showed significantly less implicit bias against mentally vs. physically ill people than internists and warmer explicit feelings towards the mentally ill. More experienced physicians displayed warmer explicit feelings towards the mentally ill and a greater level of concern for the fictional patients in the vignette than the less experienced, except when the patient was described as obese. CONCLUSIONS: Specialty moderates both implicit and explicit mental illness prejudice. Experience moderates explicit mental illness bias and concern for patients.

What Emergency Medicine Rewards: Is There Implicit Gender Bias in National Awards?,Krzyzaniak SM; Gottlieb M; Parsons M; Rocca N; Chan TM,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Multiple studies have demonstrated a gender gap in the percentage of women recognized in national awards, but to our knowledge this gap has not been studied within emergency medicine. This study is designed to evaluate the presence of a gender gap in female representation in awards from national emergency medicine organizations in the United States and Canada. METHODS: The awards from 5 national organizations during the past 5 years were reviewed. We developed a data extraction tool to identify and categorize the awards and recipients. Data were grouped according to gender distribution and assessed with respect to emergency medicine organization, year of award, category of award, and career phase specified by award. RESULTS: The overall percentage of female awardees across all 5 organizations from 2014 to 2018 was 28%. Only 16% of all named awards were named after women, and female awardees were more likely to be recognized early in their career for advocacy and work pertaining to the advancement of women, whereas men were favored for awards recognizing mentorship and organizational contributions. CONCLUSION: Emergency medicine is unique among other specialties in that the percentage of women represented in national awards (28%) closely mirrors the overall representation of women in emergency medicine (27.6% in the United States, 31% in Canada). This is in contrast to the documented leadership gap in academic medicine and emergency medicine, which may reflect a lag time between receiving national awards and earning academic and professional promotion. Although some organizations had significantly lower representation of female awardees, the overall trends indicate that women have closed the gender gap in award representation.

Slow and Steady: Using Inclusive Language to Enhance Academic Medicine's Social Accountability.,Ortega P; Osman-Krinsky M; Silva D,"Language is more than the use of words for pragmatic purposes, and language and thought are intertwined in complex ways. In medical contexts, the relational and dynamic nature of language requires that individuals pay close attention not only to the information communicated but also to how its delivery and reception impact inclusion. Adopting inclusive language principles can play a key role in those in academic medicine living up to the values of equity and inclusion, as they manifest in each of the 5 missions of academic medicine: scientific discovery, education, clinical care, collaboration with communities and partners, and standards of equity, professionalism, and ethics.In this commentary, the authors explore inclusive language as it applies to 3 topics that have rapidly evolved in academic medicine: gender inclusivity, linguistic attributes, and trauma-informed language. For each of these topics, the authors describe practical examples of how inclusive language can be applied across multiple settings in academic medicine-including the patient-physician relationship, medical education, and scholarly writing-by centering the perspectives of those who have been marginalized or excluded. When holding scholars, physicians, and leaders in academic medicine accountable for their use of inclusive language, humility should be balanced with competence. Specifically, linguistic humility should be paired with skills-building efforts and an attitude of life-long learning, and reacting to mistakes should be coupled with restorative justice approaches to address harm and proactive strategies to maximize inclusivity. Inclusive language efforts must be like the slow and steady tortoise-to be effective and authentically rigorous, academic medicine must be intentional and consistent in driving equitable and inclusive practices that support sustained participation, engagement, belonging, and thriving.",2024,Dec,Acad Med,99,12,1323-1327,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005792,39601600,#241,Ortega 2024,"",""
"Implicit gender-career bias in postgraduate medical training still exists, mainly in residents and in females.",Kramer M; Heyligers IC; Könings KD,"BACKGROUND: More and more female residents enter postgraduate medical training (PGMT). Meanwhile, women are still underrepresented in academic medicine, in leadership positions and in most surgical specialties. This suggests that female residents' career development may still be negatively impacted by subtle, often unconscious stereotype associations regarding gender and career-ambition, called implicit gender-career bias. This study explored the existence and strength of implicit gender-career bias in doctors who currently work in PGMT, i.e. in attending physicians who act as clinical trainers and in their residents. METHODS: We tested implicit gender-career bias in doctors working in PGMT by means of an online questionnaire and an online Implicit Association Test (IAT). We used standard IAT analysis to calculate participants' IAT D scores, which indicate the direction and strength of bias. Linear regression analyses were used to test whether the strength of bias was related to gender, position (resident or clinical trainer) or specialty (non-surgical or surgical specialty). RESULTS: The mean IAT D score among 403 participants significantly differed from zero (D-score = 0.36 (SD = 0.39), indicating bias associating male with career and female with family. Stronger gender-career bias was found in women (β(female) =0 .11; CI 0.02; 0.19; p = 0.01) and in residents (β(resident) 0.12; CI 0.01; 0.23; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide a solid basis for explicitly addressing implicit gender-career bias in PGMT. The general understanding in the medical field is that gender bias is strongest among male doctors' in male-dominated surgical specialties. Contrary to this view, this study demonstrated that the strongest bias is held by females themselves and by residents, independently of their specialty. Apparently, the influx of female doctors in the medical field has not yet reduced implicit gender-career bias in the next generation of doctors, i.e. in today's residents, and in females.",2021,May,BMC Med Educ,21,1,253,,10.1186/s12909-021-02694-9,33933035,#242,Kramer 2021,"",""
Reducing Implicit Gender Leadership Bias in Academic Medicine With an Educational Intervention.,Girod S; Fassiotto M; Grewal D; Ku MC; Sriram N; Nosek BA; Valantine H,"PURPOSE: One challenge academic health centers face is to advance female faculty to leadership positions and retain them there in numbers equal to men, especially given the equal representation of women and men among graduates of medicine and biological sciences over the last 10 years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the explicit and implicit biases favoring men as leaders, among both men and women faculty, and to assess whether these attitudes change following an educational intervention. METHOD: The authors used a standardized, 20-minute educational intervention to educate faculty about implicit biases and strategies for overcoming them. Next, they assessed the effect of this intervention. From March 2012 through April 2013, 281 faculty members participated in the intervention across 13 of 18 clinical departments. RESULTS: The study assessed faculty members' perceptions of bias as well as their explicit and implicit attitudes toward gender and leadership. Results indicated that the intervention significantly changed all faculty members' perceptions of bias (P < .05 across all eight measures). Although, as expected, explicit biases did not change following the intervention, the intervention did have a small but significant positive effect on the implicit biases surrounding women and leadership of all participants regardless of age or gender (P = .008).

Implicit Bias and the Association of Redaction of Identifiers With Residency Application Screening Scores.,Pershing S; Stell L; Fisher AC; Goldberg JL,"IMPORTANCE: Diversity in the ophthalmology profession is important when providing care for an increasingly diverse patient population. However, implicit bias may inadvertently disadvantage underrepresented applicants during resident recruitment and selection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of the redaction of applicant identifiers with the review scores on ophthalmology residency applications as an intervention to address implicit bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this quality improvement study, 46 faculty members reviewed randomized sets of 462 redacted and unredacted applications from a single academic institution during the 2019-2020 ophthalmology residency application cycle. INTERVENTIONS: Applications electronically redacted for applicant identifiers, including name, sex or gender, race and ethnicity, and related terms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the distribution of scores on redacted and unredacted applications, stratified by applicant's sex, underrepresentation in medicine (URiM; traditionally comprising American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic individuals) status, and international medical graduate (IMG) status; the application score β coefficients for redaction and the applicant and reviewer characteristics were calculated. Applications were scored on a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 was the best score and 9 was the worst score. Scores were evaluated for a significant difference based on redaction among female, URiM, and IMG applicants. Linear regression was used to evaluate the adjusted association of redaction, self-reported applicant characteristics, and reviewer characteristics with scores on ophthalmology residency applications. RESULTS: In this study, 277 applicants (60.0%) were male and 71 (15.4%) had URiM status; 32 faculty reviewers (69.6%) were male and 2 (0.4%) had URiM status. The distribution of scores was similar for redacted vs unredacted applications, with no difference based on sex, URiM status, or IMG status. Applicant's sex, URiM status, and IMG status had no association with scores in multivariable analysis (sex, β = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.32 to 0.15; P = .26; URiM status, β = -0.03; (95% CI, -0.36 to 0.30; P = .94; and IMG status, β = 0.39; 95% CI, -0.24 to 1.02; P = .35). In adjusted regression, redaction was not associated with differences in scores (β = -0.06 points on a 1-9 scale; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.10 points; P = .48). Factors most associated with better scores were attending a top 20 medical school (β = -1.06; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.76; P < .001), holding an additional advanced degree (β = -0.86; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.50; P < .001), and having a higher United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 score (β = -0.35 per 10-point increase; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.26; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This quality improvement study did not detect an association between the redaction of applicant characteristics on ophthalmology residency applications and the application review scores among underrepresented candidates at this institution. Although the study may not have been powered adequately to find a difference, these findings suggest that the association of redaction with application review scores may be preempted by additional approaches to enhance diversity, including pipeline programs, implicit bias training, diversity-centered culture and priorities, and targeted applicant outreach.

Institutional Culture of Belonging and Attrition Risk Among Women Health Care Professionals.,Schaechter JD; Starr JR; Silver JK,"Objective: Attrition of women health care professionals is high, threatening patient care and advances in health care sciences. Women health care professionals have often reported experiencing challenges in the workplace that lower their sense of belonging and may precipitate their attrition. The current study sought to identify dimensions of workplace belonging in women health care professionals and to determine the relative strength of association of these belonging dimensions with intent to leave (ITL) their institution. Methods: Attendees of a continuing education course on women's leadership skills in health care were surveyed about their ITL and workplace belonging experiences. Dimensions of workplace belonging were identified by factor analysis. The strength of association between ITL and each workplace belonging dimension, as well as their relative strengths of association, were assessed in ordinal regression analyses. Results: Women comprised 99% of survey participants. Three dimensions of workplace belonging were identified: ""institutional culture,"" ""interactions with supervisor,"" and ""interpersonal relationships."" More frequent experiences of support in any of the three belonging dimensions associated strongly with lower ITL. When all three belonging dimensions were considered simultaneously, ITL remained strongly related with experiences of a supportive ""institutional culture"" (odds ratio 0.41, p < 0.0001), while it became much less strongly related with supportive experiences in the other two dimensions.

The objective of this study is to explore the predisposing factors for GLM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study was conducted from 2018 to 2021 at Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University. Patients with GLM (cases) were matched with healthy examinees (controls) in a 1:1 ratio according to gender and living area. We analyzed their demographic features and investigated 75 factors that may be relevant to GLM using a standard questionnaire. Univariate and multivariable binary conditional logistic regression analyses were used to compare the differences between the two groups and evaluate the predisposing factors that may induce GLM. RESULTS: There were 594 female GLM patients and 594 matched controls included in the study. The average age of the cases was 32.78 years (mainly 20 to 40). The incidence was high within five years after childbirth, and lesions were mainly in the unilateral breast. Univariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses obtained six relevant factors and six high-risk factors. The six relevant factors included age, marriage, emotional abnormality, high prolactin, psychiatric drug intake, and sex hormone intake. Additionally, the independent high-risk factors for GLM included gestation, nipple invagination, blunt trauma, non-iatrogenic massage, lactation disorder, and nipple discharge (odds ratio (OR)=17.378, 8.518, 4.887, 3.116, 2.522, 1.685, P<0.05). Menopause was an independent protective factor (OR=0.249, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The factors that increase milk and secretion production in the mammary duct are the main risk factors of GLM, especially when the nipples are invaginated. These factors can obstruct the duct and induce inflammation. Additionally, hormonal disorders, extrinsic trauma, and emotional abnormalities can accelerate the occurrence of GLM.",2023,,Int J Womens Health,15,,1063-1075,,10.2147/IJWH.S414054,37795195,#247,Zeng 2023,"",""
Comparison of Physician Implicit Racial Bias Toward Adults Versus Children.,Johnson TJ; Winger DG; Hickey RW; Switzer GE; Miller E; Nguyen MB; Saladino RA; Hausmann LR,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The general population and most physicians have implicit racial bias against black adults. Pediatricians also have implicit bias against black adults, albeit less than other specialties. There is no published research on the implicit racial attitudes of pediatricians or other physicians toward children. Our objectives were to compare implicit racial bias toward adults versus children among resident physicians working in a pediatric emergency department, and to assess whether bias varied by specialty (pediatrics, emergency medicine, or other), gender, race, age, and year of training. METHODS: We measured implicit racial bias of residents before a pediatric emergency department shift using the Adult and Child Race Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Generalized linear models compared Adult and Child IAT scores and determined the association of participant demographics with Adult and Child IAT scores. RESULTS: Among 91 residents, we found moderate pro-white/anti-black bias on both the Adult (mean = 0.49, standard deviation = 0.34) and Child Race IAT (mean = 0.55, standard deviation = 0.37). There was no significant difference between Adult and Child Race IAT scores (difference = 0.06, P = .15). Implicit bias was not associated with resident demographic characteristics, including specialty. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that resident physicians have implicit racial bias against black children, similar to levels of bias against black adults. Bias in our study did not vary by resident demographic characteristics, including specialty, suggesting that pediatric residents are as susceptible as other physicians to implicit bias. Future studies are needed to explore how physicians' implicit attitudes toward parents and children may impact inequities in pediatric health care.",2017,Mar,Acad Pediatr,17,2,120-126,,10.1016/j.acap.2016.08.010,27620844,#248,Johnson 2017,"",""
Evaluating implicit gender bias at Canadian otolaryngology meetings through use of professional title.,Van Osch K; Dzioba A; Ahmed K; MacDonald A; Skinner J; Williams H; Strychowsky JE; Graham ME,"OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of women enter medical school annually. The number of female physicians in leadership positions has been much slower to equalize. There are also well-documented differences in the treatment of women as compared to men in professional settings. Female presenters are less likely to be introduced by their professional title (""Doctor"") for grand rounds and conferences, especially with a man performing the introduction. This study reviewed the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (CSOHNS) meetings from 2017 to 2020 to determine the proportion of presenters introduced by their professional title and whether this varied by gender. METHODS: Recordings from CSOHNS meetings were reviewed and coded for introducer and presenter demographics, including leadership positions and gender. Chi-squared tests of proportion and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare genders and identify factors associated with professional versus unprofessional forms of address. RESULTS: No significant association was found between professional title use and introducer or presenter gender. Female presenters were introduced with professional title 69.6% of the time, while male presenters were introduced with professional title 67.6% of the time (P = 0.69). Residents were introduced with a professional title with the most frequency (75.8%), while attending staff were introduced with a professional title with the least frequency (63.0%) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of gender bias in speaker introductions at recent CSOHNS meetings demonstrates progress in achieving gender equity in medicine.

Surgeon Implicit Association of Women With Supportive Roles in Medicine.,Alexander J; Rajagopalan D; Ramtin S; Ngoue M; Ring D; Adams J,"BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we documented patient implicit bias that surgeons are men. As a next step, we tested the implicit bias of surgeons that women in medicine have leading (chair, surgeon) or supporting roles (medical assistant, physician assistant). QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: (1) What is the relationship between the implicit associations and expressed beliefs of surgeons regarding women as leaders in medicine? (2) Are there factors associated with surgeon implicit association and explicit preference regarding the roles of women in medicine? METHODS: A total of 102 musculoskeletal surgeon members of the Science of Variation Group (88 men and 12 women) completed an implicit association test (IAT) of implicit bias regarding sex and lead/support roles in medicine and a questionnaire that addressed respondent demographics and explicit preference regarding women's roles. The IAT consisted of seven rounds with five rounds used for teaching and two rounds for evaluation. RESULTS: On average, there was an implicit association of women with supportive roles (D-score: -48; SD 4.7; P < 0.001). The mean explicit preference was for women in leadership roles (median: 73; interquartile ranges: 23 to 128; P < 0.001). There was a correlation between greater explicit preference for women in a leading role and greater implicit bias toward women in a supporting role (ρ = 0.40; P < 0.001). Women surgeons and shoulder and elbow specialists had less implicit bias that women have supporting roles. CONCLUSION: The observation that musculoskeletal surgeons have an explicit preference for women in leading roles in medicine but an implicit bias that they have supporting roles-more so among men surgeons-documents the gap between expressed opinions and ingrained mental processing that is the legacy of the traditional ""roles"" of women in medicine and surgery. To resolve this gap, we will need to be intentional about promotion of and emersion in experiences where the leader is a woman.

Gender and culture bias in letters of recommendation for computer science and data science masters programs.,Zhao Y; Qi Z; Grossi J; Weiss GM,"Letters of Recommendation (LORs) are widely utilized for admission to both undergraduate and graduate programs, and are becoming even more important with the decreasing role that standardized tests play in the admissions process. However, LORs are highly subjective and thus can inject recommender bias into the process, leading to an inequitable evaluation of the candidates' competitiveness and competence. Our study utilizes natural language processing methods and manually determined ratings to investigate gender and cultural differences and biases in LORs written for STEM Master's program applicants. We generate features to measure important characteristics of the LORs and then compare these characteristics across groups based on recommender gender, applicant gender, and applicant country of origin. One set of features, which measure the underlying sentiment, tone, and emotions associated with each LOR, is automatically generated using IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service.

Explicit and implicit weight bias among health care students: a cross-sectional study of 39 Australian universities.,Jayawickrama RS; O'Connor M; Flint SW; Hemmingsson E; Lawrence BJ,"BACKGROUND: Weight bias exhibited by health care students may continue into their future practice, compromising the provision of care that people living with overweight or obesity receive. This highlights the need to comprehensively examine the extent to which weight bias is present among health care students and the factors that may be associated with students' weight bias. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Australian university students enrolled in health care courses were invited via social media advertisements, snowball and convenience sampling, and by making direct contact with universities to complete an online survey. Students provided demographic information including discipline of study, perceived weight status, and state of residence. Students then completed several measures which assessed their explicit and implicit weight bias, and empathy. Descriptive statistics established the presence of explicit and implicit weight bias, and ANCOVAs, ANOVA, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the potential factors associated with students' exhibited weight bias. FINDINGS: Between March 08, 2022, and March 15, 2022, 900 eligible health care students attending 39 Australian universities participated in the study. Students reported varying levels of explicit and implicit weight bias, with minimal differences between disciplines on most outcome measures. Students who identified as men (vs. women) exhibited higher of both explicit and implicit bias (Beliefs About Obese Persons (BAOP): p = 0.0002, Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire (AFA)-Dislike: p = 0.019, AFA Willpower p < 0.0001, Empathy for Obese Patients: p = 0.0011, Implicit Association Test: p = 0.022), and students who displayed greater (vs. less) empathic concern exhibited lower levels of explicit bias (BAOP, AFA Dislike and Willpower, and Empathy for Obese Patients: p < 0.0001). Having witnessed the enactment of weight stigma sporadically (vs. regularly) by role models was associated with greater attribution of the causes of obesity to willpower (a few times a month vs. daily: p = 0.020, a few times a year vs. daily: p = 0.022), and less time spent with people living with overweight or obesity outside of study was associated with more dislike (a few times a month vs. daily: p = 0.0048, once a month vs. daily: p = 0.0002) and less fear of fat (once a month vs. daily: p = 0.036, and once a month vs. a few times a week: p = 0.0028). INTERPRETATION: Results demonstrate the presence of both explicit and implicit weight bias among Australian health care students. Several characteristics and experiences of students were associated with their weight bias. Validity of the exhibited weight bias should be established in practical interactions with people living with overweight or obesity and novel interventions should be developed to ameliorate weight bias.

Variation in Perception of Safety Culture in Out-of-hours Family Medicine Service in Croatia.,Mesarić J; Šimić D; Deilkås ECT; Hofoss D; Bondevik GT,"INTRODUCTION: The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) is among the most frequently cited tools for measuring safety culture in healthcare settings. Its ambulatory version was used in this study. The aim was to assess safety culture in out-of-hours (OOH) family medicine service and its variation across job positions, regions, and respondents' demographic characteristic. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out targeting 358 health professionals working in the 29 largest Croatian healthcare centres providing out-of-hours family medicine service. The response rate was 51.7% (185 questionnaires). The questionnaire comprised 62 Likert items with 5 responses (fully disagree to fully agree). Scores of negatively worded items were reversed before analysis. Scores on the total scale and subscales were calculated as additive scores. The study included demographic data on gender, age, working experience, and job position. Repeated measurement analysis of variance was used to assess variation of Safety Attitudes Questionnaire - Ambulatory Version (SAQ-AV) sub-scales. RESULTS: Nurses assessed safety culture higher than did physicians and residents. Teamwork climate had higher scores than Ambulatory process of care and Organizational climate. Stress recognition and Perceptions of workload had the lowest overall scores. Variation across gender, age, working experience, and region was not statistically significant.

Physicians' and advanced practice providers' perceptions of the impact of embedded clinical pharmacists on the work environment in ambulatory care clinics.,Elliott AN; Buzzard LN; Villa KR; Gadbois NR,"PURPOSE: Clinical pharmacists are recognized as valuable team members in primary care clinics due to the variety of patient care services they provide. This study examined nonpharmacist healthcare providers' perceptions of how embedded clinical pharmacists impact the work environment in ambulatory care clinics. SUMMARY: This was an exploratory mixed methods study consisting of semistructured interviews and a subsequent survey. Participants included attending and resident physicians, and advanced practice providers (APPs) practicing in clinics with an embedded clinical pharmacist. Coded interview transcripts were analyzed to identify themes that were used to develop a survey. Interview participants were not asked to complete the survey. Survey responses were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics. Subgroup analysis assessed for differences in responses based on provider type, gender, clinical practice area, years of practice, and pharmacy services utilization. Fourteen physicians and APPs participated in the semistructured interviews, and 43 other providers completed the survey. In the interviews, participants stated the clinical pharmacist contributed positively in terms of work environment, workload, work-related stress, and burnout. The major themes identified were sharing patient care responsibilities, saving provider time, and being a knowledgeable resource. Survey responses were consistent with interview statements; however, the positive impact differed between nonusers and moderate to high utilizers of clinical pharmacy services. The main barrier to collaborating with clinical pharmacists was their limited availability.

CONCLUSION: Both genetic sharing and environmental factors are important in determining RRs. It appears that there is an increase in MS risk due to environmental factors in later life (i.e. not shared family environment).

The influence of learning environment on trainee pharmacy technicians' education and training experiences.,Schafheutle EI; Jee SD; Willis SC,"BACKGROUND: In Great Britain (GB), pharmacy technicians (PTs) are registered professionals, with their education and training regulated; little is known about this or the learning environment in which it takes place. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to profile recently registered pre-registration trainee pharmacy technicians (PTPTs) in GB and capture views on PTPTs' training experiences, focussing on differences in community and hospital settings. METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted in 2013-14, following university ethics approval. One-to-one, semi-structured telephone interviews with face-to-face and distance education providers, and hospital and community pharmacy employers of PTPTs explored views on education delivery, work-based learning, and assessment. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, analysed thematically and findings informed design of a census survey of all 1457 recently registered PTs, investigating satisfaction with various aspects of their training. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS v20, employing comparative statistics (Mann-Whitney U, Chi-Square). RESULTS: Six-hundred and forty-six questionnaires were returned (response rate 44.3%), 632 were usable. Three-quarters (75.9%) of respondents had trained in community; the majority (88.0%) were female, the average age was 35.26 ± 10.22.

Provider implicit and explicit bias in person-centered maternity care: a cross-sectional study with maternity providers in Northern Ghana.,Afulani PA; Okiring J; Aborigo RA; Nutor JJ; Kuwolamo I; Dorzie JBK; Semko S; Okonofua JA; Mendes WB,"BACKGROUND: Person-centered maternity care (PCMC) has become a priority in the global health discourse on quality of care due to the high prevalence of disrespectful and lack of responsive care during facility-based childbirth. Although PCMC is generally sub-optimal, there are significant disparities. On average, women of low socioeconomic status (SES) tend to receive poorer PCMC than women of higher SES. Yet few studies have explored factors underlying these inequities. In this study, we examined provider implicit and explicit biases that could lead to inequitable PCMC based on SES. METHODS: Data are from a cross-sectional survey with 150 providers recruited from 19 health facilities in the Upper East region of Ghana from October 2020 to January 2021. Explicit SES bias was assessed using situationally-specific vignettes (low SES and high SES characteristics) on providers' perceptions of women's expectations, attitudes, and behaviors. Implicit SES bias was assessed using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) that measures associations between women's SES characteristics and providers' perceptions of women as 'difficult' or 'good'. Analysis included descriptive statistics, mixed-model ANOVA, and bivariate and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: The average explicit bias score was 18.1 out of 28 (SD = 3.60) for the low SES woman vignette and 16.9 out of 28 (SD = 3.15) for the high SES woman vignette (p < 0.001), suggesting stronger negative explicit bias towards the lower SES woman. These biases manifested in higher agreement to statements such as the low SES woman in the vignette is not likely to expect providers to introduce themselves and is not likely to understand explanations. The average IAT score was 0.71 (SD = 0.43), indicating a significant bias in associating positive characteristics with high SES women and negative characteristics with low SES women. Providers with higher education had significantly lower explicit bias scores on the low SES vignette than those with less education. Providers in private facilities had higher IAT scores than those in government hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence of both implicit and explicit SES bias among maternity providers. These biases need to be addressed in interventions to achieve equity in PCMC and to improve PCMC for all women.",2023,Mar,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,254,,10.1186/s12913-023-09261-6,36918860,#264,Afulani 2023,"",""

Of the 152 U.S. medical schools that met study accreditation criteria, the final survey population included 137 CDs (90%) whose medical schools held valid CDIM membership. RESULTS: Of the 137 surveys sent, 100 were returned (survey response rate, 73%). Respondents reported a median of 3 bias events (interquartile range, 1-4; range, 0-50) on the IM clerkship in the past year. Among 76 respondents who reported 1 or more event, microaggressions represented 43 of the 75 total events (57%). No mechanism emerged as the most commonly used method for reporting bias. Race/ethnicity (48 of 75 [64%]) and gender (41 of 75 [55%]) were cited most as the basis for bias reports, whereas the most common sources of bias were student interactions with attending physicians (51 of 73 [70%]) and residents (40 of 73 [55%]). Of the 75 respondents, 53 (71%) described the frequency of bias event reports as having increased or remained unchanged during the past year. Only 48 CDs (49%) responded that they were ""always"" aware of the outcome of bias reports. CONCLUSIONS: Bias reports remain heterogeneous, are likely underreported, and lack best practice responses. There is a need to systematically capture bias events to work toward a just culture that fosters accountability and to identify bias events through more robust reporting.",2024,Jan,Acad Med,99,1,76-82,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005472,37801579,#266,Henschen 2024,"",""
Establishing a Deaf and American Sign Language Inclusive Residency Program.,Hill C; Deville C Jr; Kiess A; Narang A; Ratnanather T; Bienstock J; Brinckerhoff L; Hodukavich A; Anderson R; Alcorn S; DeWeese T; Viswanathan A; Page BR,"Improving diversity in residency programs has been increasingly emphasized as a means to address gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in medicine. However, limited attention has been given to the potential benefits of training physicians with differences other than gender or race and ethnicity. Americans with a disability represent about 27% of the U.S. population, whereas 1%-3% of physician trainees report having a disability. In 2013, a national survey identified only 86 physicians or trainees reporting deafness or hearing loss as a disability. To date, there are no published strategies on how to create an inclusive program for Deaf trainees. Herein, the authors report on the development of a Deaf and American Sign Language (ASL) inclusive residency program that can serve as an academic model for other programs, in any medical specialty, seeking to create an accessible training program for Deaf physicians and that can be adapted for trainees with other disabilities. In March 2017, the radiation oncology residency program at Johns Hopkins University matched an ASL-signing Deaf resident who would begin the program in July 2018. In preparation, department leadership engaged key stakeholders and leaders within the university's health system and among the department faculty, residents, and staff as well as the incoming resident to create an ASL inclusive program. A 5-step transition process for the training program was ultimately developed and implemented. The authors focused on engaging the Deaf trainee and interpreters, engaging health system and departmental leadership, contracting a training consultant and developing oral and written training materials for faculty and staff, and optimizing the workspace via accommodations. Through collaborative preparation, a Deaf and ASL-signing resident was successfully integrated into the residency program. The proposed 5-step transition process provides an effective, engaging model to encourage other institutions that are seeking to employ similar inclusivity initiatives.",2022,Mar,Acad Med,97,3,357-363,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004469,34670241,#267,Hill 2022,"",""
Math and language gender stereotypes: Age and gender differences in implicit biases and explicit beliefs.,Vuletich HA; Kurtz-Costes B; Cooley E; Payne BK,"In a cross-sectional study of youth ages 8-15, we examined implicit and explicit gender stereotypes regarding math and language abilities. We investigated how implicit and explicit stereotypes differ across age and gender groups and whether they are consistent with cultural stereotypes. Participants (N = 270) completed the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) and a survey of explicit beliefs. Across all ages, boys showed neither math nor language implicit gender biases, whereas girls implicitly favored girls in both domains. These findings are counter to cultural stereotypes, which favor boys in math. On the explicit measure, both boys' and girls' primary tendency was to favor girls in math and language ability, with the exception of elementary school boys, who rated genders equally. We conclude that objective gender differences in academic success guide differences in children's explicit reports and implicit biases.",2020,,PLoS One,15,9,e0238230,,10.1371/journal.pone.0238230,32898854,#268,Vuletich 2020,"",""
Building High-Performing Teams in Academic Surgery: The Opportunities and Challenges of Inclusive Recruitment Strategies.,Dossett LA; Mulholland MW; Newman EA,"PROBLEM: In academic surgery, women and physicians from ethnic minority groups remain inadequately represented relative to their representation in the U.S. population and among medical students and surgical trainees. Although several initiatives have been aimed at developing the academic surgery pipeline or addressing issues related to faculty retention and promotion, little is known about how recruitment practices impact diversity in academic medicine. Moreover, national standards and ideal practices specific for effective recruitment in surgery have not been established. APPROACH: A working group at the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan implemented an inclusive search and selection process for all open faculty positions within the department in academic year 2017-2018. The strategy included mandatory training, a standing recruitment committee with diverse membership, broad promotion of positions, implementing a modified ""Rooney rule,"" panel interviews of candidates, standardized interview protocols, a standardized evaluation tool and scoring system, and written evaluations/ranking of candidates. OUTCOMES: Implementation of this recruitment strategy resulted in several immediate measurable benefits including increased diversity of the applicant pools and of new faculty hires. In addition to these positive effects, the department noted several knowledge gaps and faced challenges to implementing all elements of the strategy. NEXT STEPS: The authors share their framework, highlighting opportunities and challenges that are broadly generalizable and relevant for building high-performing teams in academic medicine.

Implicit math-gender stereotype present in adults but not in 8th grade.,Morrissey K; Hallett D; Bakhtiar A; Fitzpatrick C,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional math-gender stereotypes suggest that boys/men are more likely to enjoy and succeed in mathematics while girls/women are more likely to enjoy and succeed at language arts subjects. The usefulness of implicit measures of math-gender stereotypes has been a subject of investigation in mainly the adult research literature. This is problematic, as adults have typically already made many important decisions about their academic and professional futures, thus making it unclear as to whether implicit attitudes about mathematics causally influence men and women's participation in STEM. Therefore, it is important to assess if the same kind of implicit and explicit stereotypes are found among adolescents who have yet to make many of these decisions. METHODS: A total of 196 eighth-grade students and 80 adults participated in this study. Participants completed both implicit and explicit self-report measures of math-gender stereotype attitudes, in addition to measures of math self-concept, verbal self-concept, as well as mathematical performance. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We found that adolescent boys and girls reported either in-group favouritism or egalitarian attitudes towards math and language subjects. Adult participants reported more typical math-gender stereotypes on self-report measures. Adults also demonstrated a correlation between explicit and implicit measures of math-gender stereotype, which was not the case for adolescents. Implicit math-gender stereotype measures were not a reliable predictor of any other math-related variables among adults or adolescents. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the potential usefulness of implicit measures of math-gender stereotypes for adolescents.",2019,Jul,J Adolesc,74,,173-182,,10.1016/j.adolescence.2019.06.003,31229933,#270,Morrissey 2019,"",""
Prenatal and preconception population carrier screening for cystic fibrosis in Australia: where are we up to?,Massie J; Ioannou L; Delatycki M,"AIMS: To describe prenatal and preconception population carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Australia and consider progress towards establishing a universal program. METHOD: Medline and Embase databases (1989-2013) were searched for all publications with Australian data. Existing programs for CF carrier screening in Australia were reviewed and professional peak body websites accessed to determine recommendations. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Key stakeholder groups believe that prenatal and preconception carrier screening for CF should be available. Health-economic analyses support that CF carrier screening can be cost-effective. There are small programs for CF carrier screening, in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA) specifically recommend that screening be offered to women and couples planning a pregnancy and in the early stages of pregnancy. Other peak bodies indirectly endorse the availability of CF carrier screening. Barriers to screening include not being offered screening, the cost of testing, inequity of access and an incorrect perception that not having a family history of CF lowers risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is support for prenatal and preconception CF carrier screening by the community, health professionals and peak professional bodies in Australia. The barriers to development of a national screening program could be overcome with greater physician engagement and government support. IMPLICATIONS: In the interest of equity, government funded testing should be routinely offered to all pregnant women and couples planning a pregnancy.",2014,Dec,Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol,54,6,503-9,,10.1111/ajo.12255,25350764,#271,Massie 2014,"",""

Better understanding of how unconscious biases affect clinical decision making may help to illuminate clinicians' roles in propagating disparities. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinicians' unconscious race and/or social class biases correlate with patient management decisions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a web-based survey among 230 physicians from surgery and related specialties at an academic, level I trauma center from December 1, 2011, through January 31, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: We administered clinical vignettes, each with 3 management questions. Eight vignettes assessed the relationship between unconscious bias and clinical decision making. We performed ordered logistic regression analysis on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) scores and used multivariable analysis to determine whether implicit bias was associated with the vignette responses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differential response times (D scores) on the IAT as a surrogate for unconscious bias. Patient management vignettes varied by patient race or social class. Resulting D scores were calculated for each management decision. RESULTS: In total, 215 clinicians were included and consisted of 74 attending surgeons, 32 fellows, 86 residents, 19 interns, and 4 physicians with an undetermined level of education. Specialties included surgery (32.1%), anesthesia (18.1%), emergency medicine (18.1%), orthopedics (7.9%), otolaryngology (7.0%), neurosurgery (7.0%), critical care (6.0%), and urology (2.8%); 1.9% did not report a departmental affiliation. Implicit race and social class biases were present in most respondents. Among all clinicians, mean IAT D scores for race and social class were 0.42 (95% CI, 0.37-0.48) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.78), respectively. Race and class scores were similar across departments (general surgery, orthopedics, urology, etc), race, or age. Women demonstrated less bias concerning race (mean IAT D score, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.29-0.49]) and social class (mean IAT D score, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.57-0.75]) relative to men (mean IAT D scores, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.37-0.52] and 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.89], respectively). In univariate analyses, we found an association between race/social class bias and 3 of 27 possible patient-care decisions. Multivariable analyses revealed no association between the IAT D scores and vignette-based clinical assessments.

Integration of Sex and Gender Minority Standardized Patients into a Workshop on Gender-Inclusive Patient Care: Exploring Medical Student Perspectives.,Stumbar SE; Garba NA; de la Cruz M; Bhoite P; Uchiyama E,"OBJECTIVES: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities experience significant health disparities. Although coverage of health issues specific to these communities has increased in the undergraduate medical curriculum, there is still opportunity for improved teaching about sexual diversity and inclusive care. The goal of this study was to assess students' perceptions of and satisfaction with a half-day workshop focused on sexual history taking and transgender health. METHODS: The second-year clinical skills course at the Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine includes a sexual history workshop that starts with a 1-hour lecture on sexual history taking. This is followed by a faculty-facilitated small group session during which students interview an SGM patient and debrief about this experience. In 2020, for the first time, the standardized patients were members of the SGM community, and the session was on Zoom. Students completed an optional, anonymous postsession survey assessing the workshop. RESULTS: Students overwhelmingly believed that the integration of SGM standardized patients into the session helped improve their knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to providing care for this population. They noted that the standardized patient interaction and debriefing were the most beneficial parts of the session.

"Climate change, biodiversity loss, and Indigenous Peoples' health and wellbeing: A systematic umbrella review.",Brubacher LJ; Peach L; Chen TT; Longboat S; Dodd W; Elliott SJ; Patterson K; Neufeld H,"Indigenous Peoples worldwide are experiencing a cascade of impacts on their health and wellbeing as a result of climate change and biodiversity loss. Existing literature at the interface of climate change, biodiversity loss, and Indigenous health tells us that Indigenous Peoples are among those most disproportionately and acutely affected by these impacts. Yet, a gap exists with respect to comprehensively and critically synthesizing the impacts reported across this literature and identifying Indigenous-led responses. Guided by an Indigenous advisory group, we employed a systematic umbrella review methodology, following PRISMA guidelines, to characterize the global secondary literature (PROSPERO registration #: CRD42023417060). In so doing, we identified the proximal, intermediate, distal, and gendered impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on Indigenous health and wellbeing as well as Indigenous-led responses. Five databases were searched for published reviews, along with a grey literature search that focused on underrepresented geographic regions in the academic literature. Two independent reviewers conducted two-stage screening, data extraction, and quality assessment of retrieved records. Basic descriptive statistics were calculated. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, using a constant comparative approach. A total of 38 review articles met the eligibility criteria and 37 grey literature records were retrieved and included in the review. Reviews were published between 2010-2023 and geographically clustered in the Circumpolar North. Intersecting proximal, intermediate, and distal impacts were characterized as place-based and specific, and linked to colonialism as an antecedent to and driver of these impacts. Gendered impacts were underexplored within reviews. Reviewed literature underscored the value of engaging diverse knowledge systems; platforming localized, community-led adaptation to climate change and biodiversity loss, while addressing sociopolitical constraints to these efforts; and applying a broader conceptualization of health that aligns with Indigenous frameworks.

Organizational Context and Female Faculty's Perception of the Climate for Women in Academic Medicine.,Carapinha R; McCracken CM; Warner ET; Hill EV; Reede JY,"PURPOSE: Gender inequalities in the careers of faculty in academic medicine could partially be attributed to an organizational climate that can exclude or be nonsupportive of women faculty. This study explores the climate for women faculty from a systems perspective at the organizational and individual levels based on the perceptions of women faculty. Race differences were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data from women faculty (N = 3127) at 13 purposively sampled medical schools and an institutional assessment of organizational characteristics were used. Organizational factors related to the climate for women were identified using bivariate statistics. The association between perceived climate for women and organizational characteristics, individual perceptions of the work environment and individual career, and personal characteristics with control variables were investigated using hierarchical linear regression models. Organizational effects by race/ethnicity were estimated using interaction terms. RESULTS: The climate for women faculty varied across institutions and by classification as minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Respondent's report of existence of an office for women's affairs, trust in leadership, and satisfaction with mentoring were positively associated with the climate for women. Perceived workplace discrimination and work-family conflict were inversely associated with a positive climate. No race/ethnicity differences were observed in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The climate for women faculty in academic medicine should not be regarded constant across organizations, specifically between MSIs and non-MSIs. Efforts to advance a positive climate for women could focus on improving trust in leadership, increasing support for structures/offices for women, and mitigating perceived discrimination and work-family conflict.",2017,May,J Womens Health (Larchmt),26,5,549-559,,10.1089/jwh.2016.6020,28358649,#275,Carapinha 2017,"",""
Implicit Racial Bias in Medical School Admissions.,Capers Q 4th; Clinchot D; McDougle L; Greenwald AG,"PROBLEM: Implicit white race preference has been associated with discrimination in the education, criminal justice, and health care systems and could impede the entry of African Americans into the medical profession, where they and other minorities remain underrepresented. Little is known about implicit racial bias in medical school admissions committees. APPROACH: To measure implicit racial bias, all 140 members of the Ohio State University College of Medicine (OSUCOM) admissions committee took the black-white implicit association test (IAT) prior to the 2012-2013 cycle. Results were collated by gender and student versus faculty status. To record their impressions of the impact of the IAT on the admissions process, members took a survey at the end of the cycle, which 100 (71%) completed. OUTCOMES: All groups (men, women, students, faculty) displayed significant levels of implicit white preference; men (d = 0.697) and faculty (d = 0.820) had the largest bias measures (P < .001). Most survey respondents (67%) thought the IAT might be helpful in reducing bias, 48% were conscious of their individual results when interviewing candidates in the next cycle, and 21% reported knowledge of their IAT results impacted their admissions decisions in the subsequent cycle.

Various structural and perceived obstacles which contribute to a difficult path for underrepresented minority (URM) trainees have been identified, and efforts to reduce these hurdles are underway. Gaining perspective and insight from current surgical minority trainees may add valuable insight to aid with improving and innovating strategies to recruit and retain URM surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To characterize how race/ethnicity, cultural background, and gender affect the surgical training experience of URM surgical residents in all areas of surgery a focus on the field of Orthopedic Surgery, given its particularly poor rates of diversity. METHODS: Authors conducted semi-structured video interviews on current surgical residents or fellows who were members of underrepresented populations including Female, African-American/Black, Latino, Asian, Native American, and First or Second-generation immigrant status. Recruitment was achieved through a combination of voluntary, convenience, and snowball sampling procedures. Interview transcripts were then coded using conventional thematic analysis. Themes were iteratively expanded into subthemes and subsequently categorized utilizing a pile-sorting methodology. RESULTS: Among 23 surgical trainees 12 self-identified as Black (60.9%), 5 as Asian (17.4%), 1 as Hispanic (4.4%), and 5 as Caucasian (17.4%). Twelve residents identified as male (52%) and 11 as female (48%). Six surgical specialties were represented with the majority of participants (83%) being trainees in surgical subspecialties, among those orthopedic surgery was most strongly represented (57%). Analysis of their responses revealed 4 major themes: positive experiences, problems related to minority status, coping strategies, and participant suggested interventions. Themes were distilled further to sub-themes. Positive experiences' sub-themes included finding a supportive community, pride in minority status, and being able to better relate to patients. Negative experiences related to minority status' subthemes included perceived microaggressions and additional pressures, such as greater scrutiny and harsher punishments relative to their nonminority counterparts, which negatively impacted their surgical training. Most respondents did not feel there were dedicated resources to help alleviate these additional burdens, so some sought help outside of their training programs while others tried to assimilate, and others felt isolated. Recommended proposed interventions included validating the URM resident experience, providing education/training, and creating opportunities for mentorship.

This study aimed to describe a cohort of undergraduate dentistry students' perceptions of their learning environment. METHODS: Students enrolled in years 1-4 of the Bachelor of Dental Science (Honours) programme at The University of Queensland were invited to complete an online survey which included demographics and the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM). This scale measures students' perception of the educational environment overall, and for five domains: Learning, Teaching, Academic self-perception, Atmosphere and Social self-perception. Data analysis was mostly descriptive, t tests and univariate statistics compared groups. RESULTS: Participants (N = 192; females = 57%) were generally positive about their learning environment, with a total DREEM score of 127 of 200. Overall, Academic and Social self-perception domain scores were ranked lower than others. Students in preclinical years of study and/or had dentistry as a first career preference were more positive across all domains, except Social self-perception. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between the preclinical and clinical phases of the curriculum point to the structure of teaching and learning in health professional degrees. Further research should investigate how each environmental domain more specifically correlates with other aspects of the curriculum and student progression, including well-being. This could include logistical factors such as timetabling and its effect on physical well-being, to less tangible factors that may impact on mental well-being.",2019,Feb,Eur J Dent Educ,23,1,35-41,,10.1111/eje.12384,30022585,#278,Stormon 2019,"",""

Provider Implicit Bias Impacts Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes Technology Recommendations in the United States: Findings from The Gatekeeper Study.,Addala A; Hanes S; Naranjo D; Maahs DM; Hood KK,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes technology use is associated with favorable type 1 diabetes (T1D) outcomes. American youth with public insurance, a proxy for low socioeconomic status, use less diabetes technology than those with private insurance. We aimed to evaluate the role of insurance-mediated provider implicit bias, defined as the systematic discrimination of youth with public insurance, on diabetes technology recommendations for youth with T1D in the United States. METHODS: Multi-disciplinary pediatric diabetes providers completed a bias assessment comprised of a clinical vignette and ranking exercises (n = 39). Provider bias was defined as providers: (1) recommending more technology for those on private insurance versus public insurance or (2) ranking insurance in the top 2 of 7 reasons to offer technology. Bias and provider characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The majority of providers [44.1 ± 10.0 years old, 83% female, 79% non-Hispanic white, 49% physician, 12.2 ± 10.0 practice-years] demonstrated bias (n = 33/39, 84.6%).

A Shadow of Doubt: Is There Implicit Bias Among Orthopaedic Surgery Faculty and Residents Regarding Race and Gender?,Gilbert SR; Torrez T; Jardaly AH; Templeton KJ; Ode GE; Coe K; Patt JC; Schenker ML; McGwin G; Ponce BA,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery continues to be one of the least diverse medical specialties. Recently, increasing emphasis has been placed on improving diversity in the medical field, which includes the need to better understand existing biases. Despite this, only about 6% of orthopaedic surgeons are women and 0.3% are Black. Addressing diversity, in part, requires a better understanding of existing biases. Most universities and residency programs have statements and policies against discrimination that seek to eliminate explicit biases. However, unconscious biases might negatively impact the selection, training, and career advancement of women and minorities who are underrepresented in orthopaedic surgery. Although this is difficult to measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) by Project Implicit might be useful to identify and measure levels of unconscious bias among orthopaedic surgeons, providing opportunities for additional interventions to improve diversity in this field. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do orthopaedic surgeons demonstrate implicit biases related to race and gender roles? (2) Are certain demographic characteristics (age, gender, race or ethnicity, or geographic location) or program characteristics (geographic location or size of program) associated with the presence of implicit biases? (3) Do the implicit biases of orthopaedic surgeons differ from those of other healthcare providers or the general population? METHODS: A cross-sectional study of implicit bias among orthopaedic surgeons was performed using the IAT from Project Implicit. The IAT is a computerized test that measures the time required to associate words or pictures with attributes, with faster or slower response times suggesting the ease or difficulty of associating the items. Although concerns have been raised recently about the validity and utility of the IAT, we believed it was the right study instrument to help identify the slight hesitation that can imply differences between inclusion and exclusion of a person. We used two IATs, one for Black and White race and one for gender, career, and family roles. We invited a consortium of researchers from United States and Canadian orthopaedic residency programs. Researchers at 34 programs agreed to distribute the invitation via email to their faculty, residents, and fellows for a total of 1484 invitees. Twenty-eight percent (419) of orthopaedic surgeons and trainees completed the survey. The respondents were 45% (186) residents, 55% (228) faculty, and one fellow. To evaluate response biases, the respondent population was compared with that of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons census. Responses were reported as D-scores based on response times for associations. D-scores were categorized as showing strong (≥ 0.65), moderate (≥ 0.35 to < 0.65), or slight (≥ 0.15 to < 0.35) associations. For a frame of reference, orthopaedic surgeons' mean IAT scores were compared with historical scores of other self-identified healthcare providers and that of the general population. Mean D-scores were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether demographic characteristics were associated with differences in D-scores. Bonferroni correction was applied, and p values less than 0.0056 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, the mean IAT D-scores of orthopaedic surgeons indicated a slight preference for White people (0.29 ± 0.4) and a slight association of men with career (0.24 ± 0.3), with a normal distribution. Hence, most respondents' scores indicated slight preferences, but strong preferences for White race were noted in 27% (112 of 419) of respondents. There was a strong association of women with family and home and an association of men with work or career in 14% (60 of 419). These preferences generally did not correlate with the demographic, geographic, and program variables that were analyzed, except for a stronger association of women with family and home among women respondents. There were no differences in race IAT D-scores between orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare providers and the general population. Gender-career IAT D-scores associating women with family and home were slightly lower among orthopaedic surgeons (0.24 ± 0.3) than among the general population (0.32 ± 0.4; p < 0.001) and other healthcare professionals (0.34 ± 0.4; p < 0.001). All of these values are in the slight preference range. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgeons demonstrated slight preferences for White people, and there was a tendency to associate women with career and family on IATs, regardless of demographic and program characteristics, similar to others in healthcare and the general population. Given the similarity of scores with those in other, more diverse areas of medicine, unconscious biases alone do not explain the relative lack of diversity in orthopaedic surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Implicit biases only explain a small portion of the lack of progress in improving diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in our workforce and resolving healthcare disparities. Other causes including explicit biases, an unwelcoming culture, and perceptions of our specialty should be examined.

"Addressing Race, Culture, and Structural Inequality in Medical Education: A Guide for Revising Teaching Cases.",Krishnan A; Rabinowitz M; Ziminsky A; Scott SM; Chretien KC,"PROBLEM: Sociodemographic identities, including race, culture, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation (race and culture), are recognized as important determinants of health, with significant impacts on patients' health outcomes, but teaching medical students about this is challenging. The authors sought to identify areas for improvement in delivery of critical content about race, culture, structural inequalities, and health disparities within a set of virtual patient cases used by U.S. medical schools and develop revision guidelines. APPROACH: A workgroup (medical students and faculty) conducted a literature review in 2017 to identify challenges and best practices for teaching and learning about race and culture in medicine. Using an analytic framework informed by this review, they analyzed 63 Aquifer virtual patient teaching cases for effectiveness of the presentation of race and culture, resulting in six main themes describing common mistakes or pitfalls. They then developed an evidence-based guide for systematic case revision. OUTCOMES: The authors present a novel, practical guide for medical educators to use to revise existing teaching cases and improve the delivery of critical concepts surrounding race and culture. This guide includes fundamental definitions and six sections to guide structured case revision based on the main themes. It includes examples of language, suggested edits, and the rationale and evidence for recommendations. NEXT STEPS: Feedback from faculty and students regarding implementation of the guide and delivery of revised content in Aquifer cases will be critical in determining the guide's effectiveness.

Patient clinical documentation in telehealth environment: are we collecting appropriate and sufficient information for best practice?,Houser SH; Flite CA; Foster SL; Hunt TJ; Morey A; Palmer MN; Peterson J; Pope RD; Sorensen L,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth for patient visits grew rapidly and served an important role as a valuable and necessary resource. Although clinical documentation is critical for telehealth patient visits, there is limited information about how healthcare facilities manage telehealth patient visit documentation, technology used for telehealth visits, and challenges encountered with telehealth patient visit documentation. This study aimed to assess the use of telehealth during the pandemic, the quality of clinical documentation in telehealth practice and to identify challenges and issues encountered with telehealth patient visits in order to develop a strategy for best practices for telehealth documentation and data management. METHODS: Data were collected for this cross-sectional study in January-February 2021 via a self-designed survey of administrators/managers from physicians' offices and mental health facilities. Survey questions included four categories: health organization demographic information; telehealth visits; clinical documentation for telehealth visit; and challenges and barriers related to telehealth documentation technology use. RESULTS: Of 76 respondents, more than half (62%) of the healthcare facilities started using telehealth for patient visits within one year of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 94% of respondents indicating an increased use of telehealth for patient visits since the pandemic. The most common types of telehealth patient care provided during the pandemic included pediatrics, primary care, cardiology, and women's health. The most consistent data documentation of telehealth visits included: date of service, patient identification number, communication methods, patient informed consent, diagnosis and impression, evaluation results, and recommendations. The telehealth visit data was most commonly used for patient care and clinical practice, billing and reimbursement, quality improvement and patient satisfaction, and administrative planning. The top barriers to telehealth use by the healthcare professionals included patient challenges with telehealth services, such as inequities in quality of technology, lack of patient understanding, and lack of patient satisfaction; this was followed by frustration with constant updates of telehealth guidelines and procedures, understanding required telehealth documentation for reimbursement purposes, payer denial for telehealth visits, and legal and risk issues. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can assist government entities, policymakers, and healthcare organizations in developing and advocating best practices in telehealth usage and clinical documentation improvement strategies.",2022,,Mhealth,8,,6,,10.21037/mhealth-21-30,35178437,#285,Houser 2022,"",""
The role of environment on women's perception about their STEM studies: observations from a Global South country.,Tsakalerou M; Perveen A; Ayapbergenov A; Rysbekova A,"The growing global demand for STEM professionals is not being met by the supply of new graduates, a supply that is characterised by a significant lag in the percentage of women pursuing STEM studies. Interestingly enough, the percentage of female applicants entering STEM majors has been increasing yet only a minority of them pursue, or complete, engineering programs. Several studies for the developed world have identified several environmental factors responsible for this phenomenon. The scarcity of engineering professionals is a handicapping factor for development, even for the most advanced countries of the Global South. The objective of this exploratory study is to examine whether the environmental factors identified in the international literature are sufficient to explain the asymmetry in selecting an engineering or a natural sciences career among female undergraduates in an exemplary Global South country, Kazakhstan. To this purpose, a multifaceted survey was conducted among the female students pursuing STEM majors in the premier Kazakhstani university in the academic year 2021-2022. This study utilized a Likert Scale questionnaire, ordinal logistic regression, and factor analysis to explore factors affecting female students.

Since its launch, AEMES Scholars have achieved significantly higher gateway life sciences course grade point averages (GPAs), rates of persistence in life and natural sciences, and participation in natural sciences advanced research relative to baseline. Gains for Scholars in gateway course GPA eliminated the significant gap that previously existed between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-underrepresented and other students, whereas gains in natural sciences persistence now has Scholars continuing in STEM at significantly higher rates than all other students. Many of the gains for AEMES Scholars were echoed in findings of improved outcomes for our STEM students overall since AEMES' launch.

Eleven Years of Gender Data Visualization: A Step Towards More Inclusive Gender Representation.,Cabric F; Bjarnadottir MV; Ling M; Rafnsdottir GL; Isenberg P,"We present an analysis of the representation of gender as a data dimension in data visualizations and propose a set of considerations around visual variables and annotations for gender-related data. Gender is a common demographic dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specific data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented.

Inclusivity in Leader Selection: An 8-Step Process to Promote Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Leadership.,Holladay CL; Cavanaugh KJ; Perkins LD; Woods AL,"At a systemic level, organizations need to take intentional steps to build inclusion, equity, and diversity at all levels. In accordance with this need, organizations have been catalyzed by national conversations surrounding gender and racial/ethnic discrimination to generate sustainable change that addresses the disenfranchisement of women and racial/ethnic minorities. Although progress toward addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate these inequities has been made in recent years, research indicates that underrepresentation at the leadership level persists in academic medicine. Further, those in more senior roles are more likely to select, sponsor, and/or mentor individuals like themselves, thereby depriving minority populations of experiences directly correlated with career development and advancement. Hence, the authors posit a focus on the characteristics and competencies of a leader along with a structured selection process is an effective intervention to reduce bias and support inclusion by recalibrating the representation of leadership within academic medical centers. To this end, the authors developed a sequential 8-step leader selection process informed by their model of leadership characteristics and competencies. This process includes a policy update, selection of interview panels, training of panelists, screening the candidate pool, structured interview guides, final candidate slates, assessments of final candidates, and development of newly selected leaders. By following this process, the authors' organization has seen an increase in the representation of women and racial/ethnic minority leaders, an increase in employees' favorable perceptions specific to representation, and data indicative of developing and maintaining an internal diverse leadership candidate pipeline. Ultimately, inclusion makes stronger and more resilient organizations. By following a standardized process grounded in leadership characteristics and competencies, academic medical centers can see changes in their leadership that mirror the populations they lead and serve. Using such processes can lead to the kind of systemic change needed to create inclusive environments.",2023,Jan,Acad Med,98,1,36-42,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004956,36044272,#289,Holladay 2023,"",""
Vegetarian diet duration's influence on women's gut environment.,Deng X; Si J; Qu Y; Jie L; He Y; Wang C; Zhang Y,"BACKGROUND: Nutrient composition of vegetarian diets is greatly different from that of omnivore diets, which may fundamentally influence the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. The interactions between diet pattern and gut environment need further illustration. This study aims to compare the difference in the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites between vegetarian and omnivore female adults and explore associations between dietary choices/duration and gut environment changes. METHODS: In this study, investigations on the fecal metabolome together with the gut microbiome were performed to describe potential interactions with quantitative functional annotation. In order to eliminate the differences brought by factors of gender and living environment, 80 female adults aged 20 to 48 were recruited in the universities in Beijing, China. Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were applied to screen differential data between groups from gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. Furthermore, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed as the bioinformatics analysis tool for describing the correlations between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. Moreover, participants were further subdivided by the vegetarian diet duration for analysis. RESULTS: GPCR-mediated integration of enteroendocrine signaling was predicted to be one of the regulatory mechanisms of the vegetarian diet. Intriguingly, changes in the gut environment which occurred along with the vegetarian diet showed attenuated trend as the duration increased. A similar trend of returning to ""baseline"" after a 10-year vegetarian diet was detected in both gut microbiota and fecal metabolome.

Genetic predisposition and antipsychotic treatment effect on metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia: a ten-year follow-up study using the Estonian Biobank.,Alver M; Kasela S; Haring L; Luitva LB; Fischer K; Möls M; Milani L,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) patients exhibit 30% higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) compared to the general population with its suboptimal management contributing to increased mortality. Large-scale studies providing real-world evidence of the underlying causes remain limited. METHODS: To address this gap, we used real-world health data from the Estonian Biobank, spanning a median follow-up of ten years, to investigate the impact of genetic predisposition and antipsychotic treatment on the development of MetS in SCZ patients. Specifically, we set out to characterize antipsychotic treatment patterns, genetic predisposition of MetS traits, MetS prognosis, and body mass index (BMI) trajectories, comparing SCZ cases (n = 677) to age- and sex-matched controls (n = 2708). FINDINGS: SCZ cases exhibited higher genetic predisposition to SCZ (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.58-1.94), but lower polygenic burden for increased BMI (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.88-0.96) and C-reactive protein (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97) compared to controls. While SCZ cases showed worse prognosis of MetS (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.54-2.46), higher antipsychotic adherence within the first treatment year was associated with reduced long-term MetS incidence. Linear mixed modelling, incorporating multiple BMI timepoints, underscored the significant contribution of both, antipsychotic medication, and genetic predisposition to higher BMI, driving the substantially upward trajectory of BMI in SCZ cases. INTERPRETATION: These findings contribute to refining clinical risk prediction and prevention strategies for MetS among SCZ patients and emphasize the significance of incorporating genetic information, long-term patient tracking, and employing diverse perspectives when analyzing real-world health data.

This study aimed to obtain in-depth qualitative understanding of the clinical learning environment at Damascus University Faculty of Dental Medicine, Syria. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with eight postgraduate dental students at Damascus University Faculty of Dental Medicine. The faculty has eight clinical departments; therefore, a single participant was purposively sampled from each department. The male-female ratio of the eight interviewed participants was 1:1. All interviews were conducted between 26 (th) April 2020 and 8 (th) January 2021. Data was analyzed inductively using reflective thematic analysis. Pragmatic saturation was discussed during the analysis and the authors made an interpretative judgement to stop data collection at the eighth interview. Results: Major themes which emerged covered different aspects of the clinical learning environment such as clinical training, social interaction and assessment procedures. Faculty's negligence of their teaching duties was one of the most recurrent themes. In clinical training and due to faculty inaccessibility, students had to rely on themselves or their senior peers in training. The social climate was perceived negatively and assessment was described as unfair and biased.

METHODS:  Participants were self-identified WNB providers employed by a pediatric healthcare organization and its affiliated medical university. An eligibility screener was completed by 150 qualified respondents, and 40 WNBs actually participated in study interviews. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide to rank interventions targeted at improving equity, with time allotted for interviewees to discuss their personal lives and how individual circumstances impacted their professional experiences. RESULTS:  WNB providers called for efficient workflows and reducing uncompensated job demands. Support for family responsibilities, flexible financial/compensation models, and improved job resources all were endorsed similarly. Participants ranked direct supervisor and leader support substantially lower than other interventions.  Conclusions: Career mentorship and academic support for WNB individuals are recognized interventions for advancement and retention but were not ranked as top priorities.

The High School Environment and the Gender Gap in Science and Engineering.,Legewie J; DiPrete TA,"Despite the striking reversal of the gender gap in education, women pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees at much lower rates than those of their male peers. This study extends existing explanations for these gender differences and examines the role of the high school context for plans to major in STEM fields. Building on recent gender theories, we argue that widely shared and hegemonic gender beliefs manifest differently across schools so that the gender-specific formation of study plans is shaped by the local environment of high schools. Using the National Education Longitudinal Study, we first show large variations between high schools in the ability to attract students to STEM fields conditional on a large set of pre-high school measures. Schools that are successful in attracting students to these fields reduce the gender gap by 25 percent or more. As a first step toward understanding what matters about schools, we then estimate the effect of two concrete high school characteristics on plans to major in STEM fields in college-a high school's curriculum in STEM and gender segregation of extracurricular activities.

An Anatomic Predisposition to Mandibular Angle Fractures.,Seeley-Hacker BL; Holmgren EP; Harper CW; Lauer CS; Van Citters DW,"PURPOSE: To investigate a predisposition to mandibular angle fractures, a retrospective study was performed in which fractured mandibles were compared with healthy mandibles with no history of fracture. Other investigations of angle fracture risk have exclusively studied patients with existing fractures. In addition, the risk has not been comprehensively explained in conjunction with the specific features of mandibular anatomy. We sought to characterize any anatomic variations between the jaws that had fractured and those that had never fractured. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy mandibles with no history of fracture were physically measured at the William M. Bass Skeletal Collection at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and compared with fractured mandibles from computed tomography (CT) scans at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. A total of 52 healthy mandibles and 44 CT scans were evaluated. MATLAB machine learning algorithms (MathWorks, Natick, MA) were used to compare the study populations and isolate those anatomic features that differed between healthy and fractured mandibles. RESULTS: Machine learning classifiers were able to differentiate between male and female jaws, with the condylion-gnathion distance the most distinguishing feature. The 6 most common anatomic features that differed between healthy and fractured mandibles were the 1) retromolar space, 2) perimeter of the cross-section just proximal to the second molar, 3) breadth of the ramal cross-section, 4) thickness of the oblique ridge, 5) transgonial angle, and 6) location of the ipsilateral mental foramen. The presence of third molars was also related to fracture risk, with third molars present in 72.7% of the fractured mandibles versus 26.9% of unfractured mandibles. Of the fractured mandibles with third molars present, 87.5% had the fracture running directly through the tooth or its socket. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study have provided evidence that anatomic differences exist between mandibles that sustain angle fractures and those that do not. Although much of the morphology was found to be interdependent, the fracture risk could be accurately predicted using 6 anatomic features. Understanding these mandibular variations and identifying patients vulnerable to mandibular fracture could provide clinicians with additional objective information. Furthermore, using the methods demonstrated in our study, future research could focus on developing an algorithm that includes these unique anatomic features in the hope of assisting surgeons in providing tailored treatment for mandibular angle fractures according to patient-specific morphology.",2020,Dec,J Oral Maxillofac Surg,78,12,2279.e1-2279.e12,,10.1016/j.joms.2020.05.042,32649890,#301,Seeley-Hacker 2020,"",""
"Meeting expectations: An exploration of academic emergency medicine faculty experiences and preferences in the virtual meeting environment by age, gender and parental status.",Goldflam K; Crichton IC; Coughlin RF; Bod J; Agrawal P; Bradby C; Tsyrulnik A,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual meetings became the norm in academic emergency medicine (EM) departments. This study explores the experiences of academic EM faculty within this environment. METHODS: In 2021, authors surveyed a cross-sectional convenience sample of EM faculty using a mixed-methods approach to explore perceptions of the virtual meeting environment. Authors reported data on a five-point Likert scale, summarized as percentages, and calculated differences using Pearson's chi-squared test, where p < 0.05 was significant. Free text responses were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Two-hundred-fifty-nine responses were collected, (female [55.6%], ≤40 years old, [39.8%]) of which 33.2% had children ≤7 years old. Most respondents felt the total number of virtual meetings had increased and were more likely to happen outside of regular business hours compared to in-person meetings. Most faculty preferred meetings during regular hours and liked the virtual format overall. Younger faculty respondents were more polarized in their preferences of timing of meetings and reported more pressure to accept meetings outside of regular hours. Female respondents with young children were more likely to dislike meetings outside regular hours and to have declined them. Women faculty, younger faculty, and women faculty with young children were significantly more likely to agree that women had been ""more impacted by the new virtual work environment."" Qualitative themes highlighting the flexibility provided by the virtual work environment and decreased commuting time, though many felt communication was limited in virtual meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Academic EM faculty mostly preferred keeping meetings during regular business hours and in a virtual format. Experiences varied by age but not by gender overall. Women with young children reported greater challenges than women without. Men did not differ by parental status. The virtual format provided increased flexibility but limited communication and engagement.

"On the gender-science stereotypes held by scientists: explicit accord with gender-ratios, implicit accord with scientific identity.",Smyth FL; Nosek BA,"Women's representation in science has changed substantially, but unevenly, over the past 40 years. In health and biological sciences, for example, women's representation among U.S. scientists is now on par with or greater than men's, while in physical sciences and engineering they remain a clear minority. We investigated whether variation in proportions of women in scientific disciplines is related to differing levels of male-favoring explicit or implicit stereotypes held by students and scientists in each discipline. We hypothesized that science-is-male stereotypes would be weaker in disciplines where women are better represented. This prediction was tested with a sample of 176,935 college-educated participants (70% female), including thousands of engineers, physicians, and scientists. The prediction was supported for the explicit stereotype, but not for the implicit stereotype. Implicit stereotype strength did not correspond with disciplines' gender ratios, but, rather, correlated with two indicators of disciplines' scientific intensity, positively for men and negatively for women. From age 18 on, women who majored or worked in disciplines perceived as more scientific had substantially weaker science-is-male stereotypes than did men in the same disciplines, with gender differences larger than 0.8 standard deviations in the most scientifically-perceived disciplines. Further, particularly for women, differences in the strength of implicit stereotypes across scientific disciplines corresponded with the strength of scientific values held by women in the disciplines. These results are discussed in the context of dual process theory of mental operation and balanced identity theory. The findings point to the need for longitudinal study of the factors' affecting development of adults' and, especially, children's implicit gender stereotypes and scientific identity.",2015,,Front Psychol,6,,415,,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00415,25964765,#303,Smyth 2015,"",""
Simulation as an educational tool to teach emergency medicine residents about unconscious bias.,Primiani N; Murphy L; Dephoure S; Thompson C; Ng C,"Medical training embraces simulation-based education. One important topic that has recently been added to the simulation curriculum at the University of Toronto is unconscious bias. This educational innovation project evaluates a simulation that could be used as a novel instructional design strategy to teach unconscious bias. The simulation involved two resuscitation scenarios with a similar clinical trajectory. Each resuscitation was led by standardized physicians of different binary genders, followed by a debrief with highly trained facilitators. Tangible educational takeaways on team dynamic variation between different gendered team leaders were discussed following the simulation, highlighting its benefit to resident education on bias awareness and response. Limitations include inevitable unconscious bias in facilitators and unequal gender representation in the learner participants, which may impact simulation effectiveness.

Psychometric Properties for Multidimensional Cognitive Load Scale in an E-Learning Environment.,Choi Y; Lee H,"(1) Background: A learner's cognitive load in a learning system should be effectively addressed to provide optimal learning processing because the cognitive load explains individual learning differences. However, little empirical research has been conducted into the validation of a cognitive load measurement tool (cognitive load scale, i.e., CLS) suited to online learning systems within higher education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CLS in an online learning system within higher education through the framework suggested by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. (2) Methods: Data from 800 learners were collected from a cyber-university in South Korea. The age of students ranged from 20 to 64. The CLS was developed, including three components: extraneous cognitive load, intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. Then, psychometric properties of the CLS were evaluated including reliability and validity. Evidence relating to content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity were collected. The response pattern of each item was evaluated on the basis of item response theory (IRT). Cronbach's α was computed for reliability. (3) Results: The CLS presented high internal consistency. A three-factor model with extraneous cognitive load, intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive load was suggested by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. This three-factor model is consistent with the previous research into the cognitive load in an offline learning environment. Higher levels of the extraneous cognitive load and intrinsic cognitive load were related to lower levels of academic achievement in an online learning environment, but the germane cognitive load was not significantly positively associated with midterm exam scores, though it was significantly related to the final exam scores. IRT analysis showed that the item-fit statistics for all items were acceptable. Lastly, the measurement invariance was examined through differential item functioning analysis (DIF), with the results suggesting that the items did not contain measurement variance in terms of gender. (4) Conclusions: This validation study of the CLS in an online learning environment within higher education assesses psychometric properties and suggests that the CLS is valid and reliable with a three-factor model. There is a need for an evaluation tool to take into account the cognitive load among learners in online learning system because the characteristics of learners within higher education were varied. This CLS will help instructional/curriculum designers and educational instructors to provide more effective instructions and identify individual learning differences in an online learning environment within higher education.",2022,May,Int J Environ Res Public Health,19,10,,,10.3390/ijerph19105822,35627358,#305,Choi 2022,"",""

We describe the development and implementation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate survey at our residency program, the results of which have informed our DEI efforts. METHODS: A resident-faculty work group collaboratively developed an 81-item questionnaire, informed by other institutional climate surveys. We administered the survey annually from 2018 through 2021 to all residents and faculty at our large academic family medicine residency program. The anonymous survey covered six key areas: general climate, climate for specific group, personal experience with discrimination and harassment, recruitment, burnout, and curriculum. RESULTS: Average response rates were 84% and 50% for residents and faculty, respectively. Survey results show low satisfaction with resident and faculty diversity; higher rates of burnout for respondents who self-identify as URM, persons of color (POC), and/or LGBTQ; and racial and gender differences in experiences of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.

METHODS: We utilized a cross-sectional survey design.  Participants were 221 medical students (96 males and 125 females) from all classes (1st to 6th year). Each participant responded to a translated version of the DREEM questionnaire that measures five domains: students' perception of learning (SPL), students' perception of teachers (SPT), students' academic self-perception (SASP), students' perception of atmosphere (SPA), and students' social self-perception (SSSP). Numerical differences between male and female students were analyzed using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: The global average score of female students was significantly higher (105.0±22.9, 53% of maximum score) than male students (98.3±24.3, 49% of maximum score; t((219))= -2.119, p= 0.035).

Industry payments and implicit bias in cardiothoracic surgery: Difference in industry payments to cardiothoracic surgeons by gender.,Gulati S; Wang S; Mazzola E; Marshall MB,"OBJECTIVE: Industry payments, as sources of revenue and prestige, may contribute to gender implicit bias. We examined industry payments to cardiothoracic surgeons to determine differences with respect to gender while accounting for practice focus and experience. METHODS: Payments to cardiothoracic surgeons from 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 were abstracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payment database. Data were restricted to individual payments >$1000 and the following payment criteria: consulting fees, compensation for services other than consulting, honoraria, education, compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a nonaccredited and noncertified continuing education program, and grant. Physician profiles were queried for gender, practice type, and year of last fellowship completion. Descriptive statistics were reported based on these factors. RESULTS: In 2014, 509 cardiothoracic surgeons (497 men and 12 women) received meaningful industry payments. Male surgeons received $10,471,192 (99.3%) with median payment of $6500 and mean of $21,069, whereas women received $70,310 (0.7%) with median of $3500 and mean of $5859.

Tackling Gender and Racial Bias in Academic Emergency Medicine: The Perceived Role of Implicit Bias in Faculty Development.,Cleveland Manchanda EC; Macias-Konstantopoulos WL,"Background Gender and racial disparities in academic medicine have recently garnered much attention. Implicit Association Tests (IATs) offer a validated means of evaluating unconscious associations and preferences. This study examines the perceived role of implicit bias in faculty development in academic emergency medicine (EM). Methods EM faculty at a large urban academic medical center were invited to independently participate in a self-reflection assessment in preparation for a faculty retreat session discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants completed two IATs designed to examine gender associations (gender IAT) and race preferences (race IAT) followed by a short anonymous survey where IAT scores were recorded. The survey also captured demographic information and perceptions about the impact of gender and racial biases in faculty development. Results Forty faculty members (66%) completed the survey; 70% were male and 80% white. The majority (59%) reported gender IAT results indicating automatic male-sciences and female-liberal arts associations. Nearly half (45%) reported race IAT results indicating an automatic preference for white people. More than 70% of males reported that faculty recruitment, development, and promotion decisions were 'never' or 'seldom' affected by gender bias, while more than 80% reported racial bias 'never' or 'seldom' affects these decisions. Female faculty more frequently perceived adverse effects of unconscious gender and race biases. Conclusion Our group of academic physicians reported IAT results showing different levels of implicit bias compared to the general population. Female faculty may be both more aware of and more susceptible to the adverse effects of unconscious biases. Further study is needed to determine both the extent to which unconscious biases affect the academic workplace, as well as ways in which such unintentional forms of discrimination can be eliminated. Unconscious biases are not unique to EM. Intentional efforts to increase self-awareness of these 'blind spots' may help mitigate their impact and foster a more diverse and inclusive healthcare environment.",2020,Nov,Cureus,12,11,e11325,,10.7759/cureus.11325,33282598,#312,ClevelandManchanda 2020,"",""

"The experiences of medical students, residents, fellows, and attendings in the emergency department: Implicit bias to microaggressions.",Brown C; Daniel R; Addo N; Knight S,"OBJECTIVES: Microaggressions and implicit bias occur frequently in medicine. No previous study, however, has examined the implicit bias and microaggressions that emergency medicine (EM) providers experience. Our primary objective was to understand how often EM providers experience implicit bias and microaggressions. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the types of microaggressions they experience and whether their own identifying characteristics are risk factors. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to EM providers across the United States. Outcome measures of experiencing or witnessing a microaggression, overt discrimination, or implicit bias were described using frequencies, proportions, and logistic regressions. Where a univariate association between outcome measures and demographic characteristics was found, multivariate regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was performed. Proportional odds logistic regression models were used to evaluate the specific type of microaggressions experienced and if there was an association with demographic variables. RESULTS: A total of 277 medical providers (48% trainees-medical students, residents, and fellows-and 52% attending physicians) completed the survey. A total of 181 (65%) respondents reported experiencing a microaggression. Female (OR = 5.9 [95% CI = 3.1 to 11.2]) and non-White respondents (OR = 2.4 [95% CI = 1.2 to 4.5]) were more likely to report experiencing any microaggression. Misidentification, the most common form of microaggression, was more common with trainees compared to attending physicians (proportional OR [POR] = 2.6 [95% CI = 1.7 to 4.0]) and non-White, compared to White, respondents (POR = 2.2 [95% CI = 1.3 to 3.6]).

Furthermore, few curricular options have been developed to discuss gender bias. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of gender bias, examine qualitative differences between men and women, and create a gender bias curriculum for internal medicine residents. METHODS: We surveyed 114 residents (response rate of 53.5%) to identify the prevalence and types of gender bias experienced in training. We compared estimates between genders and organized qualitative results into shared themes. We then developed a curriculum to promote and normalize discussions of gender bias. RESULTS: Among surveyed residents, 61% reported personal experiences of gender bias during training, with 98% of women and 19% of men reporting experiences when stratified by gender. We identified two domains in which gender bias manifested: role misidentification and a difficult working environment. Residents identified action items that led to the development of a gender bias curriculum. The curriculum includes didactic conferences and training sessions, a microaggression response toolkit, dinners for men and women residents, participation in a WhatsApp support group, and participation in academic projects related to gender bias in training.

We evaluated factors reflecting institutional culture (promotion, retention, hiring, and biasing language in promotion letters) as part of an intervention to help shift culture and raise awareness of flexibility policies at the University of California, Davis (UCD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on faculty use of family-friendly policies were obtained at baseline, and surveys for policy awareness were conducted pre(2010)/post(2013) an NIH-funded study educational intervention. Data on hires, separations, and promotions were obtained pre(2007-2009, 2234 person-year data points)/post(2010-2012, 2384 person-year data points) intervention and compared by logistic regression and for gender differences. Department promotion letters (53) were also analyzed for biasing language. RESULTS: Policy use was overall low, highest for female assistant professors, and for maternity leave. Awareness significantly increased for all policies postintervention. Promotions decreased, likely because of increases in advancement deferrals or tenure clock extensions. Pre/postintervention, female and male hires were near parity for assistant professors, but female hires were substantially lower than males for associate (54% less likely, p = 0.03) and full professors (70% less likely, p = 0.002). Once hired, women were no more likely to separate than men. Fewer associate/full professors separated than assistant professors (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively), regardless of gender. Language in promotion letters was not gender biased. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a shift at UCD toward a culture of work-life flexibility, an environment in which letters of recommendation show very few biased descriptions, and in which assistant professor hiring is gender equitable. At the same time, a decrease in number of faculty members applying for promotion and an imbalance of men over women at senior hires independent of policy awareness may challenge the assumption that family-friendly policies, while promoting flexibility, also have a positive impact on professional advancement.",2017,May,J Womens Health (Larchmt),26,5,530-539,,10.1089/jwh.2016.6018,28170291,#318,Villablanca 2017,"",""
U.S. medical school admissions and enrollment practices: status of LGBTQ inclusivity.,Gamble RM; Pregnall AM; Deng A; Ehrenfeld JM; Talley J,"CONTEXT: The failure to collect information on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) identity in healthcare and medical education is a part of a systemic problem that limits academic medical institutions' ability to address LGBTQ health disparities. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether accurate sexual and gender minority (SGM) demographic data is being consistently collected for all US medical schools during admissions and enrollment, and whether differences exist between collection practices at osteopathic and allopathic schools. METHODS: Secure, confidential electronic were sent via email in July 2019 to 180 osteopathic (n=42) and allopathic (n=138) medical schools identified through the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Student Guide to Osteopathic Medical Colleges database and the American Association of Medical Colleges Medical School Admissions Requirements database. The nine question survey remained open through October 2019 and queried for; (1) the ability of students to self report SGM status during admissions and enrollment; and (2) availability of SGM specific resources and support services for students. Chi square analysis and the test for equality of proportions were performed. RESULTS: Seventy five of 180 (41.7%) programs responded to the survey; 74 provided at least partial data. Of the 75 respondent schools, 55 (73.3%) allowed applicants to self report a gender identity other than male or female, with 49 (87.5%) of those being allopathic schools compared with 6 (31.6%) osteopathic schools. Similarly, 15 (20.0%) allowed applicants to report sexual orientation, with 14 (25.5%) of those being allopathic schools compared with one (5.3%) osteopathic school. Fifty four of 74 (73.0%) programs allowed matriculants to self report a gender identity other than male or female; 11 of 74 (14.7%) allowed matriculants to report sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Demographics collection practices among American medical education programs that responded to our survey indicated that they undervalued sexual orientation and gender identity, with osteopathic programs being less likely than allopathic programs to report inclusive best practices in several areas. American medical education programs, and their supervising bodies, must update their practices with respect to the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity demographics as part of a holistic effort to address SGM health disparities.",2021,Jul,J Osteopath Med,121,10,787-793,,10.1515/jom-2021-0062,34256423,#319,Gamble 2021,"",""
Female Representation and Implicit Gender Bias at the 2017 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' Annual Scientific and Tripartite Meeting.,Davids JS; Lyu HG; Hoang CM; Daniel VT; Scully RE; Xu TY; Phatak UR; Damle A; Melnitchouk N,"BACKGROUND: Women surgeons are underrepresented in academic surgery and may be subject to implicit gender bias. In colorectal surgery, women comprise 42% of new graduates, but only 19% of Diplomates in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the representation of women at the 2017 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Scientific and Tripartite Meeting and assessed for implicit gender bias. DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study. SETTING: The study occurred at the 2017 Tripartite Meeting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the percentage of women in the formal program relative to conference attendees and forms of address. METHODS: Female program representation was quantified by role (moderator or speaker), session type, and topic. Introductions of speakers by moderators were classified as formal (using a professional title) or informal (using name only), and further stratified by gender. RESULTS: Overall, 31% of meeting attendees who are ASCRS members were women, with higher percentages of women as Candidates (44%) and Members (35%) compared with Fellows (24%). Women comprised 28% of moderators (n = 26) and 28% of speakers (n = 80). The highest percentage of women moderators and speakers was in education (48%) and the lowest was in techniques and technology (17%). In the 41 of 47 sessions evaluated, female moderators were more likely than male moderators to use formal introductions (68.7% vs 54.0%, p = 0.02). There was no difference when female moderators formally introduced female versus male speakers (73.9% vs 66.7%, p = 0.52); however, male moderators were significantly less likely to formally introduce a female versus male speaker (36.4% vs 59.2%, p = 0.003). LIMITATIONS: Yearly program gender composition may fluctuate. Low numbers in certain areas limit interpretability. Other factors potentially influenced speaker introductions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, program representation of women was similar to meeting demographics, although with low numbers in some topics. An imbalance in the formality of speaker introductions between genders was observed. Awareness of implicit gender bias may improve gender equity and inclusiveness in our specialty.

Purpose: to assess students' perception of educational environment and to evaluate the difference in perception related to academic performance and demographic characteristics in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, 2020. Method: The authors performed an observational analytical cross-sectional study at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, using a validated structured closed-ended self -administered questionnaire; the Dundee Ready Educational environment measurement (DREEM). They included all students registered in the faculty for the academic year 2020-2021 except the first semester students. They used proportionate stratified sampling to divide students into strata and sub-strata based on batch number and sex, respectively. Then, they selected students proportionately from each substrata using simple random sampling. Results: out of 405 randomly selected students, 341 (84.2%) filled the questionnaire. The mean total DREEM score was (104.48/200), indicating a positive perception of the learning environment. This, with only student's perception of atmosphere subscale showing negative results. Test results showed a significant difference between different student's age groups, academic phases and batches in regards to their perception of atmosphere (p-value 0.023, 0.001, 0.013 respectively). Regarding residence, a significant difference was found in total DREEM scores, with students residing in university dormitories having a more positive perception. Test results showed no significant difference in student's perception of educational environment in all DREEM subscales between achievers and underachievers.

The effect of a preconception and antenatal nutritional supplement on children's BMI and weight gain over the first 2 years of life: findings from the NiPPeR randomised controlled trial.,Lyons-Reid J; Derraik JGB; Kenealy T; Albert BB; Nieves JMR; Monnard CR; Titcombe P; Nield H; Barton SJ; El-Heis S; Tham E; Godfrey KM; Chan SY; Cutfield WS,"BACKGROUND: Nutritional intervention before and throughout pregnancy might promote healthy infant weight gain; however, clinical evidence is scarce. Therefore, we examined whether preconception and antenatal supplementation would affect the body size and growth of children in the first 2 years of life. METHODS: Women were recruited from the community before conception in the UK, Singapore, and New Zealand, and randomly allocated to either the intervention (myo-inositol, probiotics, and additional micronutrients) or control group (standard micronutrient supplement) with stratification by site and ethnicity. Measurements of weight and length were obtained from 576 children at multiple timepoints in the first 2 years of life. Differences in age and sex standardised BMI at age 2 years (WHO standards) and the change in weight from birth were examined. Written informed consent was obtained from the mothers, and ethics approval was granted by local committees. The NiPPeR trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02509988) on July 16, 2015 (Universal Trial Number U1111-1171-8056). FINDINGS: 1729 women were recruited between Aug 3, 2015, and May 31, 2017. Of the women randomised, 586 had births at 24 weeks or more of gestation between April, 2016, and January, 2019. At age 2 years, adjusting for study site, infant sex, parity, maternal smoking, maternal prepregnancy BMI, and gestational age, fewer children of mothers who received the intervention had a BMI of more than the 95th percentile (22 [9%] of 239 vs 44 [18%] of 245, adjusted risk ratio 0·51, 95% CI 0·31-0·82, p=0·006). Longitudinal data revealed that the children of mothers who received the intervention had a 24% reduced risk of experiencing rapid weight gain of more than 0·67 SD in the first year of life (58 [21·9%] of 265 vs 80 [31·1%] of 257, adjusted risk ratio 0·76, 95% CI 0·58-1·00, p=0·047). Risk was likewise decreased for sustained weight gain of more than 1·34 SD in the first 2 years (19 [7·7%] of 246 vs 43 [17·1%] of 251, adjusted risk ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·34-0·88, p=0·014). INTERPRETATION: Rapid weight gain in infancy is associated with future adverse metabolic health. The intervention supplement taken before and throughout pregnancy was associated with lower risk of rapid weight gain and high BMI at age 2 years among children. Long-term follow-up is required to assess the longevity of these benefits.

The Operating Room and Learning Environment for US-Based Muslim Women in Medicine.,Mehrabi S; Rimawi A; El-Ghazali A; Kishawi D; Ali H; Cobb K,"OBJECTIVE: As the number of women in medical training rises, there has been increased interest in understanding the perspectives of minority women. Although Muslim women face unique challenges in pursuing medical training, there are no current studies dedicated to understanding the experience of Muslim women as healthcare professionals. This study aims to present insight into perspectives of United States-based Muslim women physicians, residents, and medical students on discrimination and allyship, the operating room environment, mentorship, and institutional resources. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was distributed between November 2020 and March 2021 to US-based Muslim women in medical training. The survey was designed to query perspectives across four domains: discrimination and allyship, the operating room environment, mentorship, and institutional resources. Respondents completed a series of 32 questions and were invited to provide free-form comments at the end of the survey. Two-sided tests of significance were used, with a 0.05 threshold. Analyses were performed using R, Version 1.3. SETTING: Online cross-sectional survey distributed from a major academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 117 Muslim women in the United States in medical training (MD/DO pathways) (n = 117). RESULTS: Respondents reported high levels of discrimination, significant barriers to reporting discrimination, unique challenges in the operating room, and limited institutional support. The majority reported satisfaction with the mentorship available to them, with gender concordance deemed more important than religion concordance. CONCLUSIONS: In this report of survey results, we present insight into perspectives of US-based Muslim women in medicine on mentorship, discrimination & allyship, the operating room environment, and institutional resources.

Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes.,Zhang Y; Tayarani M; Wang S; Liu Y; Sharma M; Joly R; RoyChoudhury A; Hermann A; Gao OH; Pathak J,"BACKGROUNDS: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women's mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients' residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients' residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. RESULTS: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. CONCLUSIONS: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD.

Implicit Theories and Engagement in Math Among Chinese Adolescent Students: A Moderated Mediation Model of Intrinsic Value and Academic Self-Efficacy.,Jiang S; Liu RD; Ding Y; Fu X; Sun Y; Jiang R; Hong W,"Recent studies have established associations between students' implicit theories and their academic engagement. However, there is still limited understanding of the potential mechanisms of this relation, and whether it works for students in the context of mathematics as well as in other subjects. The current study aimed to fill this gap by conducting a two-wave survey examining a moderated mediation model concerning the psychological mechanisms that account for the association between students' implicit theories and mathematics engagement. Applying the theoretical framework of implicit theory, we hypothesized that intrinsic value would be a possible mediating variable between students' implicit theories and academic engagement, and that students' academic self-efficacy would moderate the link between implicit theory and intrinsic value. A sample of 710 Chinese adolescent students self-reported their implicit theory, intrinsic value, and academic self-efficacy at Time 1, and engagement in math at Time 2, 12 months apart. After controlling for age and gender, the results revealed positive associations between students' implicit theories and their engagement in math, and intrinsic value partially mediated the relation between implicit theories and engagement in math. Moreover, students' academic self-efficacy moderated the link between implicit theory and intrinsic value. These findings contribute to the understanding of the impact of implicit theory on students' mathematics engagement. Limitations and implications for instructional practices are discussed.",2020,,Front Psychol,11,,1325,,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01325,32676046,#325,Jiang 2020,"",""
"Towards inclusive healthcare: evaluating knowledge, confidence and awareness of LGBTQ + health among Internal Medicine Trainees in London.",Crowe A; Hogan P; Morrison C; Meads C; Bailey D,"BACKGROUND: Patients from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus (LGBTQ +) community face various health inequalities and report poor healthcare experiences. Little is known about how knowledgeable and confident UK doctors are around LGBTQ + health, and previous research demonstrates that UK medical schools rarely deliver teaching in this area. This research evaluated the level of knowledge, awareness and confidence of LGBTQ + health among Internal Medical Trainees (IMTs) in London. METHODS: London IMTs were invited to complete an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge, awareness and confidence in LGBTQ + health. Stratified analysis of results by demographics was performed. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifteen surveys were analysed from 796 eligible trainees (40%). Confidence in caring for LGBTQ + patients was variable. Confidence in discussing gender identity was lower than for sexual orientation. Knowledge of health issues affecting LGBTQ + patients varied. Most participants had never received training on LGBTQ + health at undergraduate (n = 201, 64%) or postgraduate level (n = 252, 80%), but the majority of participants felt that training would be useful (n = 233, 74%). Stratified analysis revealed that IMTs who received previous LGBTQ + teaching at undergraduate or postgraduate level were considerably more confident discussing sexual orientation with patients, compared to those who received no previous teaching. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need for education on LGBTQ + health, given the varied levels of knowledge and confidence identified. A significant majority of IMTs in London have never received teaching on LGBTQ + health, although there exists a strong desire for this. LGBTQ + health topics should be integrated into undergraduate and postgraduate training and examinations for IMTs. This would support IMTs in delivering high quality and inclusive care for all patients, particularly those of sexual orientation and gender identity minorities.

Perception of Learning Environment among Undergraduate Medical Students in Two Different Medical Schools through DREEM and JHLES Questionnaire.,Sengupta P; Sharma A; Das N,"INTRODUCTION: Assessment of learning environment is essential to assess the acceptability of the curriculum among students. Several tools are available to assess undergraduate medical students' perception of learning environment. Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire is the most commonly used tool. Here, we have used both the widely used DREEM questionnaire and a relatively new questionnaire Johns Hopkins Learning Environment Scale (JHLES). AIM: Assessment of students' perception of learning environment of two eastern Indian medical schools using DREEM and JHLES questionnaire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional questionnaire based study, 200 students from Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College (NRSMC) and 78 students from College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital (CMSDH) of 5(th) semester batch duly completed the two questionnaires, DREEM scale and JHLES tool. The DREEM questionnaire has 50 questions arranged in five domains. The JHLES questionnaire has 28 questions arranged in seven domains. Comparison of scores between the two colleges was done by unpaired t-test. RESULTS: There were altogether 100 female and 178 male participants with mean age of 20.46±0.67. There were no significant difference between the overall DREEM score (p=0.81) and the JHLES scores (p=0.10) obtained from NRSMC and that obtained from CMSDH. Analysis of individual domain scores on DREEM scale revealed that there were no significant differences in domain scores for the two medical schools except for Students' Perception of Atmosphere (SPA) score (p=0.0086). JHLES revealed significant differences in terms of engagement, inclusion and safety, and physical space (p<0.001). The DREEM and JHLES results revealed positive correlation (r=0.59). CONCLUSION: Both DREEM and JHLES scores revealed comparable results from two schools with positive correlation between DREEM and JHLES tools, however some areas with low scores require modification especially the domain assessing Students' Academic Self-Perception (SASP) and Students' Social Self Perceptions (SSSP).",2017,Feb,J Clin Diagn Res,11,2,JC01-JC04,,10.7860/JCDR/2017/23810.9248,28384888,#327,Sengupta 2017,"",""
Mentoring Faculty: A US National Survey of Its Adequacy and Linkage to Culture in Academic Health Centers.,Pololi LH; Evans AT; Civian JT; Vasiliou V; Coplit LD; Gillum LH; Gibbs BK; Brennan RT,"INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the quantity and quality of mentoring faculty in US academic health centers (AHCs), (2) measure associations between mentoring and 12 dimensions that reflect the culture of AHCs, and (3) assess whether mentoring predicts seriously contemplating leaving one's institution. METHODS: During 2007-2009, our National Initiative on Gender, Culture and Leadership in Medicine (C - Change) conducted a cross-sectional study of faculty from 26 representative AHCs in the United States using the 74-item C - Change Faculty Survey to assess relationships of faculty characteristics and various aspects of the institutional culture (52% response rate). Among the 2178 eligible respondents (assistant, associate, and full professors), we classified their mentoring experience as either inadequate, neutral, or positive. RESULTS: In this national sample, 43% of the 2178 respondents had inadequate mentoring; only 30% had a positive assessment of mentoring. There was no statistical difference by sex, minority status, or rank. Inadequate mentoring was most strongly associated with less institutional support, lower self-efficacy in career advancement, and lower scores on the trust/relationship/inclusion scale. The percent of faculty who had seriously considered leaving their institution was highest among those who had inadequate mentoring (58%), compared to those who were neutral (28%) or had positive mentoring (14%) (all paired comparisons, p < .001). DISCUSSION: In a national survey of faculty of US AHCs, mentoring was frequently inadequate and this was associated with faculty contemplating leaving their institutions. Positive mentoring, although less prevalent, was associated with many other positive dimensions of AHCs.",2015,Summer,J Contin Educ Health Prof,35,3,176-84,,10.1002/chp.21294,26378423,#328,Pololi 2015,"",""
Exploring medical students' experience of the learning environment: a mixed methods study in Saudi medical college.,Almansour M; Abouammoh N; Idris RB; Alsuliman OA; Alhomaidi RA; Alhumud MH; Alghamdi HA,"BACKGROUND: In medical education, the learning environment (LE) significantly impacts students' professionalism and academic performance. Positive LE perceptions are linked to better academic outcomes. Our study, which was conducted 15 years after curriculum reform at King Saud University's College of Medicine, aimed to explore students' perspectives on their LE and identify areas for improvement. By understanding their experiences, we strive to enhance LE and promote academic success. METHODS: This mixed-method study employed an explanatory sequential approach in which a cross-sectional analytical survey phase was collected first using the Johns Hopkins Learning Environment Scale (JHLES), followed by qualitative focus groups. Findings from quantitative and qualitative methods were integrated using joint display. RESULTS: A total of 653 medical students completed the JHLES. The total average score was 81 out of 140 (16.8), and the average subscale scores ranged from 2.27 (0.95) for inclusion and safety to 3.37 (0.91) for community of peers. The qualitative approach encompasses both inductive and deductive analyses, identifying overarching themes comprising proudness, high expectations and competition, and views about the curriculum. The integration of results emphasizes the need for continued efforts to create a supportive and inclusive LE that positively influences students' experiences and academic success. CONCLUSION: This research offers valuable insights for educational institutions seeking to enhance medical education quality and support systems. Recommendations include faculty development, the cultivation of supportive environments, curriculum revision, improved mentorship programs, and initiatives to promote inclusivity and gender equity. Future research should explore longitudinal and comparative studies, innovative mixed methods approaches, and interventions to further optimize medical education experiences.

"Inclusion of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, and Other Related Identities Content in Australian Physical Therapy Curricula: Perceived Barriers and Priorities for Inclusive Education.",Ross MH; McPherson K; Walters J; Chipchase L,"INTRODUCTION: Providing culturally responsive, patient-centered care is crucial for ensuring safe and positive health care experiences for individuals with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Doing so requires adequate training and knowledge of the health professionals involved in those health care experiences. REVIEW OF LITERATURE: Individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and other related identities (LGBTQIA+) experience significant barriers to health and positive health care experiences. In physical therapy, research has identified that individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ experience discrimination, discomfort, and lack of practitioner knowledge about health needs. The aim of this study was to determine how, and to what extent, content related to LGBTQIA+ individuals is included in Australian physical therapy curricula as well as perceived barriers to inclusion. SUBJECTS: Physical therapy program directors (PDs) as of January 2022 for all Australian universities that deliver physical therapy programs (n = 24). METHODS: A Qualtrics survey was emailed to PDs to collect quantitative and qualitative data regarding the inclusion and mode of delivery of LGBTQIA+ content, as well as the perceived importance, and barriers to inclusion, of LGBTQIA+ curricula. RESULTS: Twenty-four (100%) universities (PD or proxy) responded to the survey. More than 62% (15/24) of PDs reported that their programs included LGBTQIA+ content with 88% (21/24), indicating that LGBTQIA+ content is relevant to the physical therapy curriculum. Time devoted to LGBTQIA+ content ranged from 0 to 6 (median 2-4) hours across any year, delivered primarily in general or foundational courses (37%). Perceived lack of trained faculty (14/22; 64%) and time (13/22; 59%) were barriers to the integration of LGBTQIA+ specific content into the curriculum. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that the physical therapy curriculum may be contributing to ongoing negative experiences of individuals identifying as LGBTQIA+ with physical therapy encounters. Although most (87%) physical therapy program leaders in Australia believe that LGBTQIA+ specific content is relevant to the training of new graduates, content is included in only 62% of curricula. Perceived barriers to inclusion of LGBTQIA+ specific curriculum were a lack of time and appropriately trained faculty. Externally developed content is available to address limited expertise within programs, but faculty may require guidance on how to overcome perceived lack of time (ie, space in the curriculum). CONCLUSION: Most Australian physical therapy programs include LGBTQIA+ content to a limited extent in their curricula, indicating a lack of perceived importance relative to other topics. In this way, Australian universities are maintaining the pervasive heteronormativity of the physical therapy profession and are complicit in the ongoing health disparities between the LGBTQIA+ and heteronormative communities.",2023,Dec,J Phys Ther Educ,37,4,284-293,,10.1097/JTE.0000000000000304,38478783,#330,Ross 2023,"",""
"Doctoral students' perceived working environment, obstacles and opportunities at a Swedish medical faculty: a qualitative study.",Falk LL; Augustin H; Torén K; Magnusson M,"BACKGROUND: Investment in research is high on the agenda of many countries in recognition of the fact that research is important for the development of society. Doctoral students have a vital role and represent a substantial part of this investment. It is therefore imperative to reduce the risk of students dropping out from doctoral studies. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain deeper insight into the working conditions of, and obstacles and opportunities for, doctoral students at an institute of medicine in Sweden. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with 17 doctoral students-of varying genders, professions and fields of research-from the Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: Four categories emerged from the data. They were: Safety, Frustrating Structures, Others - not me, and the future. They included positive as well as negative perceptions. Among the positive perceptions were recognition of the importance of the supervisor, as well as secure conditions, and personal development. Frustrating structures in the academic culture, stress and differences in career building constituted the negative points. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a need for structures within the university that support doctoral students who feel they are not receiving the assistance they need, who believe they have unreasonable working conditions, or who may need to change supervisors in order to complete their graduate research studies. Our study also highlights the fact that supervisors have a major influence on the work environment of doctoral students, and that the general and academic perception of the research area likewise has an effect on the successful completion of the research project and dissertation.

Increasing representation of marginalized groups among care providers is imperative to help address this. Limited literature exists on bias awareness strategies for interviewers during the selection of applicants to General Internal Medicine (GIM) programs in Canada. This study examines the trial of bias reduction tools to increase interviewers' awareness of implicit biases. METHODS: The Model of Improvement framework guided the trail of an instructional video, the adapted implicit association test (IAT), and a paper awareness tool (PAT) to increase interviewers' awareness of implicit biases during the University of Alberta's GIM applicant selection. An anonymous online survey was disseminated to physician interviewers. Descriptive statistics (percentages) and a modified sentiment analysis was completed. RESULTS: 10 of 14 interviewers completed the survey. Respondents reported an increased awareness of using bias reduction tools (IAT, 25%; video, 71%; PAT, 67%) to inform them on their implicit biases. The future use of IAT, video, and PAT was supported by 50%, 71%, and 67% of interviewers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Interviewers prefer the instructional video and PAT over the IAT. Textual responses suggest existing concerns for biases inherent to the interview process yet 70% (7/10) of respondents believe that interviews should have a weighting of 50% towards final ranking of candidates. As many institutions continue to rely on interviews to evaluate candidates, our findings indicate the need for a national study to develop a framework to mitigate inherent biases during interviewing of candidates.",2024,Nov,BMC Med Educ,24,1,1265,,10.1186/s12909-024-06244-x,39501300,#332,Mudiayi 2024,"",""

OBJECTIVES: To assess medical students' experiences with online e-learning (OeL) satisfaction, intellectual environment, and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the College of Medicine, University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire (21 items) was used to evaluate OeL in three domains of satisfaction (nine items), intellectual environment (seven items), and communication (five items). Students from years one to six were invited to fill out the questionnaire form with five-point Likert scale responses. Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and independent t-test were used to evaluate the association between variables. RESULTS: Out of 237 participants, 96.6% (158 male and 71 female) responded to the questionnaire. Most students (86.5%) preferred the blackboard for their e-learning. The mean total scores were 30.18 ± 6.9 out of 45 for satisfaction, 19.67 ± 5.4 out of 25 for communication 25.43 ± 5.1 out of 35 for the intellectual environment. Over 50% of the students rated moderate scores on satisfaction and intellectual environment domains. About 85% of the students rated moderate scores in the communication domain. Male students rated higher significant scores than female students for satisfaction (31.3 ± 6.3 vs 27.6 ± 7; P < .001) and intellectual environment (26.3 ± 4.32 vs 3.5 ± 6.1; P < .001). There were no significant differences in students' responses to the tested domains related to GPA level. Significantly higher levels of scores for satisfaction (33.3 ± 5.6 vs 28.8 ± 6.9; P < .001) and communication (21.2 ± 4.5 vs 18.9 ± 5.7; P = .019) were obtained by clerkship students than pre-clerkship.

Perceptions of Factors Associated With Inclusive Work and Learning Environments in Health Care Organizations: A Qualitative Narrative Analysis.,Aysola J; Barg FK; Martinez AB; Kearney M; Agesa K; Carmona C; Higginbotham E,"IMPORTANCE: Diversifying the health care workforce remains a critical goal for health care organizations focused on reducing disparities in care. However, it remains unknown what factors create inclusive health system environments and help organizations retain a diverse workforce. OBJECTIVE: To understand from members of the health care workforce what factors contribute to inclusive work and learning environments and what can be done to improve inclusion within health care organizations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative narrative analysis of responses to a weekly email call for narratives within health care organizations sent June 1, 8, 15, and 22, 2016. The email contained an anonymous link to 2 open-ended stimulus questions asking for stories reflecting inclusion or lack thereof within participants' work environments as well as demographic questions. The study took place at 6 hospitals, including a free-standing children's hospital and a Veterans Affairs medical center, 4 health sciences schools (Medicine, Nursing, Dental, and Social Policy and Practice), and outpatient facilities within a university-based health care system in Pennsylvania. There were 315 completed narratives submitted from health care system executives (n = 3), staff (n = 113), academic faculty (n = 97), trainees or students (n = 99), and 3 who declined to specify their positions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Workplace experiences with inclusivity, implications of these experiences, and recommendations to improve inclusion within environments. RESULTS: Of 315 narratives submitted from members of the health care system, in 188 (59.7%) the writer self-identified as female; in 10 (3.2%), as transgender/queer; in 38 (12.1%), as non-Hispanic black; in 152 (48.3%), as non-Christian; in 31 (9.8%), as having a language other than English as their primary language; and in 14 (4.4%), as having a disability. Analysis of the narratives revealed 6 broad factors that affected inclusion within health care organizations: (1) the presence of discrimination; (2) the silent witness; (3) the interplay of hierarchy, recognition, and civility; (4) the effectiveness of organizational leadership and mentors; (5) support for work-life balance; and (6) perceptions of exclusion from inclusion efforts. Challenges with inclusion had negative effects on job performance and well-being, with reports of stress, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. Most respondents referenced a systemic culture that influenced their interpersonal dynamics and provided specific strategies to improve organizational culture that focused on leadership training and expanding collegial networks.

"Introductory Learning of Inclusive Sexual History Taking: An E-Lecture, Standardized Patient Case, and Facilitated Debrief.",Bakhai N; Ramos J; Gorfinkle N; Shields R; Fields E; Frosch E; Shochet R; Sanders R,"INTRODUCTION: This student-driven curriculum intervention, implemented with first-year medical students, was guided by the Association of American Medical Colleges' standards for medical education on health care for sexual and gender minorities. Its goals are to describe the spectrum of sexual orientation and gender identity and sensitively and effectively elicit relevant information from patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity through inclusive sexual history taking. METHODS: Developed through student-faculty collaboration, this three-part module includes a 14-minute e-lecture on taking an inclusive sexual history, a 35-minute formative standardized patient encounter in which students take a sexual history and receive feedback, and a 20-minute facilitated group debrief on the standardized patient activity. RESULTS: Students completed a postmodule evaluation anonymously; the majority of respondents (92%) agreed that they felt more prepared to take a sexual history inclusive of sexual and gender minority patients. Most were more comfortable discussing sexual orientation (91%) and gender identity (83%) with patients after the module. Content analysis revealed an improved confidence in creating a safe space for sexual and gender minority patients and an increased awareness of biases about sexual and gender minority patients. DISCUSSION: This curriculum serves as an early foundation for students to understand sexual and gender minority identities and develop confidence in their inclusive sexual history taking skills before they provide care for patients. In addition, the student-driven curriculum development process used can serve as a template for students at other institutions hoping to collaborate with faculty to develop comprehensive sexual and gender minority curricula.",2016,Dec,MedEdPORTAL,12,,10520,,10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10520,30984862,#336,Bakhai 2016,"",""
Integrating climate change and health topics into the medical curriculum - a quantitative needs assessment of medical students at Heidelberg University in Germany.,Rybol L; Nieder J; Amelung D; Hachad H; Sauerborn R; Depoux A; Herrmann A,"OBJECTIVES: Climate change (CC) is of major importance for physicians as they are directly confronted with changing disease patterns, work in a greenhouse gas intensive sector and can be potential advocates for healthy people on a healthy planet. METHODS: We assessed third to fifth year medical students' needs to support the integration of CC topics into medical curricula. A questionnaire with 54 single choice-based items was newly designed with the following sections: role perception, knowledge test, learning needs, preference of educational strategies and demographic characteristics. It was administered online to students at Heidelberg medical faculty. Data sets were used for descriptive statistics and regression modelling. RESULTS: 72.4% of students (N=170, 56.2% female, 76% aged 20-24 years) (strongly) agreed that physicians carry a responsibility to address CC in their work setting while only 4.7% (strongly) agreed that their current medical training had given them enough skills to do so. Knowledge was high in the area of CC, health impacts of CC, vulnerabilities and adaptation (70.1% correct answers). Knowledge gaps were greatest for health co-benefits and climate-friendly healthcare (55.5% and 16.7% of correct answers, respectively). 79.4% wanted to see CC and health included in the medical curriculum with a preference for integration into existing mandatory courses. A multilinear regression model with factors age, gender, semester, aspired work setting, political leaning, role perception and knowledge explained 45.9% of variance for learning needs. CONCLUSION: The presented results encourage the integration of CC and health topics including health co-benefits and climate-friendly healthcare, as well as respective professional role development into existing mandatory courses of the medical curriculum.",2023,,GMS J Med Educ,40,3,Doc36,,10.3205/zma001618,37377571,#337,Rybol 2023,"",""
Female human pluripotent stem cells rapidly lose X chromosome inactivation marks and progress to a skewed methylation pattern during culture.,Geens M; Seriola A; Barbé L; Santalo J; Veiga A; Dée K; Van Haute L; Sermon K; Spits C,"STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Does a preferential X chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern exist in female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and does the pattern change during long-term culture or upon differentiation? STUDY FINDING: We identified two independent phenomena that lead to aberrant XCI patterns in female hPSC: a rapid loss of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and long non-coding X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) expression during culture, often accompanied by erosion of XCI-specific methylation, and a frequent loss of random XCI in the cultures. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Variable XCI patterns have been reported in female hPSC, not only between different hPSC lines, but also between sub-passages of the same cell line, however the reasons for this variability remain unknown. Moreover, while non-random XCI-linked DNA methylation patterns have been previously reported, their origin and extent have not been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: We investigated the XCI patterns in 23 human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines, during long-term culture and after differentiation, by gene expression analysis, histone modification assessment and study of DNA methylation. The presence and location of H3K27me3 was studied by immunofluorescence, XIST expression by real-time PCR, and mono- or bi-allelic expression of X-linked genes was studied by sequencing of cDNA. XCI-specific DNA methylation was analysed using methylation-sensitive restriction and PCR, and more in depth by massive parallel bisulphite sequencing. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All hPSC lines showed XCI, but we found a rapid loss of XCI marks during the early stages of in vitro culture. While this loss of XCI marks was accompanied in several cases by an extensive erosion of XCI-specific methylation, it did not result in X chromosome reactivation. Moreover, lines without strong erosion of methylation frequently displayed non-random DNA methylation, which occurred independently from the loss of XCI marks. This bias in X chromosome DNA methylation did not appear as a passenger event driven by clonal culture take-over of chromosome abnormalities and was independent of the parental origin of the X chromosome. Therefore, we suggest that a culture advantage conferred by alleles on the X chromosome or by XCI-related mechanisms may be at the basis of this phenomenon. Finally, differentiated populations inherited the aberrant XCI patterns from the undifferentiated cells they were derived from. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: All hPSC lines in this study were cultured in highly similar conditions. Our results may therefore be specific for these conditions and alternative culture conditions might lead to different findings. Our findings are only a first step towards elucidating the molecular events leading to the phenomena we observed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results highlight the significant extent of aberrant XCI in female hPSC. The fact that these aberrations are inherited by the differentiated progeny may have a significant impact on downstream research and clinical uses of hPSC. In order to achieve the full potential of hPSC, more insight into the XCI status and its stability in hPSC and its effect on the properties of the differentiated progeny is needed.

"Write More Articles, Get More Grants: The Impact of Department Climate on Faculty Research Productivity.",Sheridan J; Savoy JN; Kaatz A; Lee YG; Filut A; Carnes M,"BACKGROUND: Many studies find that female faculty in academic medicine, science, and engineering experience adverse workplace climates. This study longitudinally investigates whether department climate is associated with future research productivity and whether the associations are stronger for female than male faculty. METHOD: Two waves of a faculty climate survey, institutional grant records, and publication records were collected for 789 faculties in academic medicine, science, and engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2000 and 2010. Research productivity was measured as Number of Publications and Number of Grants awarded, and department climate was measured with scales for professional interactions, department decision-making practices, climate for underrepresented groups, and work/life balance. Ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression methods were used to assess gender differences in productivity, influences of department climate on productivity, and gender differences in effects of climate on productivity. RESULTS: Female faculty published fewer articles and were awarded fewer grants in the baseline period, but their productivity did not differ from male faculty on these measures in subsequent years. Number of Publications was positively affected by professional interactions, but negatively affected by positive work/life balance. Number of Grants awarded was positively affected by climate for underrepresented groups. These main effects did not differ by gender; however, some three-way interactions illuminated how different aspects of department climate affected productivity differently for men and women in specific situations. CONCLUSIONS: In perhaps the first study to assess the longitudinal impact of department climate on faculty research productivity, positive department climate is associated with significantly greater productivity for all faculty-women and men. However, some positive aspects of climate (specifically, work/life balance) may be associated with lower productivity for some female faculty at specific career periods. These findings suggest that departments that wish to increase grants and publications would be wise to foster a positive workplace climate.",2017,May,J Womens Health (Larchmt),26,5,587-596,,10.1089/jwh.2016.6022,28375751,#339,Sheridan 2017,"",""

METHODS: A 31-item survey was distributed via an internet survey service to women between the ages of 18 and 45. The survey included subject demographics, a query regarding the source of subjects' knowledge of genetics, and 6 question genetics quiz with 3 fundamental questions and 3 advanced questions. Subjects were divided into parous and nulliparous groups, and responses were compared using student's t-test for continuous variables and chi square for proportions. RESULTS: Participants included 207 parous and 221 nulliparous women. There were no differences in demographic characteristics including age and education. Parous women scored significantly higher than nulliparous women on the fundamental genetics quiz (71 vs 61 %, p = 0.03). This difference remained but was no longer significant when the 3 advanced questions were included (48 vs 42 %). Only 39 % of parous and 8 % of nulliparous subjects listed their physician as one of their main sources of genetic information. 78 % of all subjects stated that they would prefer to receive genetic information from their physicians over other sources. CONCLUSIONS: Recently parous women scored higher on a genetics assessment quiz than did their nulliparous counterparts, but the majority did not cite their obstetrician gynecologists as a main source of information.

A humanistic environment for dental schools: what are dental students experiencing?,Quick KK,"A Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standard now requires that dental schools commit to establishing a ""humanistic culture and learning environment"" for all members of the academic environment. The aim of this study was to identify students' perceptions of factors that affect the dental school environment and to test differences in their experiences in terms of gender and year. This picture of the existing environment was meant to serve as a first step toward creating and supporting a more humanistic academic environment. A mixed-methods approach was used for data collection during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 academic years at one U.S. dental school. Four focus groups were first conducted to explore challenges and conflicts faced by students during their dental education. A written survey informed by the focus group results was then used to obtain quantitative data. The survey response rate was 47 percent (N=188). Faculty inconsistency, cheating, and belittlement/disrespect were experienced by many of the responding dental students during their education, similar to what has been documented in medicine. These students also reported experiencing both constructive communication (90 percent) and destructive communication (up to 32 percent). The female students reported more gender discrimination and sexual harassment than their male peers, and the clinical students reported more experience with belittlement and destructive communication than the preclinical students.

Is medical school culture conducive to women's academic success? a survey on faculty perceptions and experiences of gender equity.,Shorey S; Gan YH; Cavert MS; Archuleta S,"BACKGROUND: In academic medicine, the lack of gender equity hinders the career progression of women academics. This can often affect scientific productivity and widen the gender gap that exists in this field. As such, this study aimed to understand how full-time faculty members in academic medicine perceive the climate for women academics and identify target areas for interventions supporting gender equity. METHODS: This study adopted an embedded mixed-methods design. Data collection was done from November 2022 to January 2023, at the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Medicine. The participants comprised academic clinicians and non-clinician faculty members who were either currently employed full-time at the NUS School of Medicine or had recently resigned. They completed an adapted version of the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS) questionnaire, which assessed their perceptions of the faculty climate across four domains: equal access, work-life balance, freedom from gender bias, and supportive leadership. Quantitative findings were complemented by qualitative data gathered through open-ended survey questions. ANOVA and t-test were used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. RESULTS: Compared to female participants (M = 140.0, SD = 57.9), male participants perceived greater gender equity (M = 158.7, SD = 62.9). Personal experiences of gender inequity were described by some female participants. Participants also raised various suggestions to improve work-life balance for both male and female faculty members, mitigate structural gender bias and increasing support for women faculty. CONCLUSIONS: Female faculty members tend to have a less favourable view of the working climate for women in academic medicine, compared to their male counterparts. This might be attributed to differences in awareness of gender inequity and understanding of gender bias. Findings of this study provided further insight into the perceptions of faculty members regarding workplace gender equity and interventions that can be implemented to support them in their career.

OBJECTIVES: To examine of pre-registration nursing students (first, second and third year) assessment of their actual experiences of their most recent clinical learning clinical learning experience. DESIGN: A cross sectional survey involving a descriptive online anonymous questionnaire based on the clinical learning environment inventory tool. SETTINGS: One higher education institution in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing students (n=147) enrolled in an undergraduate nursing degree. METHODS: This questionnaire included demographic questions and the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory (CLEI) a 42 item tool measuring student's satisfaction with clinical placement. SPPS version 22 was employed to analyse data with descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Overall students were satisfied with their clinical learning experience across all placement areas. This was linked to the 6 constructs of the clinical learning environment inventory; personalization, innovation, individualization, task orientation, involvement, satisfaction. Significant differences in student experience were noted between age groups and student year but there was no difference noted between placement type, age and gender.

Reflexivity and positionality applied to medical practice: a study on implicit gender bias with medical students in a Swiss university.,Arena F; Geiser E; Auer S; Clair C; Schwarz J,"BACKGROUND: An array of evidence shows how the presence of implicit bias in clinical encounters can negatively impact provider-patient communication, quality of care and ultimately contribute to health inequities. Reflexive practice has been explored as an approach to identify and address implicit bias in healthcare providers, including medical students. At the Lausanne School of Medicine, a clinically integrated module was introduced in 2019 to raise students' awareness of gender bias in medical practice using a reflexivity and positionality approach. The purpose of this study is to describe the gender bias that were identified by medical students, analysing their types, places and modes of emergence during a clinical encounter. It further explores how positionality supported students' reflection on the way in which social position modulates their relationship to patients. METHODS: As part of the teaching activity, medical students individually reflected on gender bias in a specific clinical encounter by answering questions in their electronic portfolio. The questionnaire included a section on positionality. We qualitatively analysed the students' assignments (n=76), applying a thematic analysis framework. RESULTS: Medical students identified and described gender biases occurring at different moments of the clinical encounter (anamnesis (i.e. patient history), physical exam, differential diagnosis, final management). They causally associated these biases with wider social phenomena such as the gendered division of labour or stereotypes around sexuality and gender. Analysing students' reflections on how their position influenced their relationship with patients, we found that the suggested exercise revealed a major contradiction in the process of medical enculturation: the injunction to be neutral and objective erases the social and cultural context of patients and impedes an understanding of gender bias. CONCLUSION: Gender biases are present in the different steps of a clinical consultation and are rooted in broader gendered social representations. We further conclude that the tension between a quest for objectivity and the reality of social encounters should be made explicit to students, because it is constitutive of medical practice.",2024,Jul,Int J Equity Health,23,1,132,,10.1186/s12939-024-02222-3,38951888,#351,Arena 2024,"",""
"""Make sure that everybody feels there is a space for them"": Understanding and promoting appearance inclusivity at university.",Waite E; Parnell J; Guest E; Harcourt D; Stokes R; Slater A,"Appearance concerns are a pervasive issue affecting many university students and contributing to poor psychosocial and academic outcomes. To combat these, action is needed by universities to promote appearance inclusivity. The current study used inductive qualitative methods to explore students' lived and/or living experiences and concerns relating to their physical appearance and views on how to achieve an appearance inclusive university. Seventeen students aged 19-55 from a UK university participated in online semi-structured interviews (n=12) and focus groups (n=5). Thirteen participants were women, three were men, and one was non-binary. Interviews and focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Students identified several ways appearance concerns had negatively impacted them and supported an increased focus on appearance inclusivity at university. Three themes were developed: 1) appearance has a big impact on my university life; 2) it's not the same for everyone (i.e., individual differences and intersectionality impact students' experiences); and 3) intentional change is needed (i.e., change is necessary to improve appearance inclusivity, but it should be consciously thought out).

A Retrospective Study of Orthoptic Students' and Teaching Experience with the Introduction of Technology Promoting a Blended Learning Environment: Experiences with technology in a blended learning environment.,Lança C; Bjerre A,"PURPOSE: Evaluation of the students' experience and academic achievements following the introduction of online learning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 2011, online learning activities were introduced in the teaching of the Research in Orthoptics module for final year undergraduate orthoptic students. The online learning activities were created and delivered in Moodle; an open-source online learning platform. Students from the academic year groups of 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2016-17 completed an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into 6 categories (relevance, reflection, interactivity, tutor support, peer support and interpretation) with 4 questions within each category. A 5-point Likert scale was used to score each question. The sum of answers within each category ranged from 4 (negative perception) to 20 (positive perception). Student performance was assessed using the marks retrospectively for 2 years before online learning was introduced and when online learning was included. RESULTS: Forty-two students replied to the questionnaire with a mean age of 23.0 ± 2.3 years (range 21-32). There were 38 females (90.5%) and 4 males (9.5%). Combining the 3 academic cohorts there was a significant difference between the 6 categories of the questionnaire (p < 0.0001). Three categories obtained the same high median score of 16: relevance (range 9-20), reflection (range 11-20) and tutor support (range 12-20). Peer support resulted in the lowest median score of 13. Separation of the three academic year cohorts' revealed significant differences for tutor support (p = 0.03). The score increased from 16 in 2012-13 and 2013-14 to 18 in 2016-17. Significant differences were found between the marks for the cohorts from 2009-10 to 2016-17 (F(7,245) = 5.07: p < 0.0001). The mean mark for year group 2009-2010 was significantly less compared to 2012-13 (p < 0.0001), 2014-15 (p = 0.01) and 2015-16 (p = 0.02) and year group 2011-12's mark significantly less than 2012/13 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Including online learning in the research module had a positive impact on the student experience, although more work needs to be done to improve peer support.

The physician experience of patient to provider prejudice (PPtP).,Andreae DA; Massand S; Dellasega C,"BACKGROUND: Patients can demonstrate prejudice and bias toward minoritized physicians in a destructive dynamic identified as PPtP (Patient Prejudice toward Providers). These interactions have a negative impact on the physical and mental well-being of both those who are targeted and those who witness such behaviors. STUDY PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the PPtP experiences of attending physicians who identify as a minority based on race, ethnicity, citizenship status, or faith preference. METHODS: Qualitative methodology was used to collect data using in-depth interviews. 15 attending physicians (8 male, 7 female, aged 33-55 years) who identified as minorities based on ethnicity, citizenship status, or faith practices were interviewed individually. Interviews were conducted using a guide validated in previous studies and content analysis was performed by two trained researchers to identify themes. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: A Continuum of Offenses, Professional Growth through Adversity, Organizational Issues, Role of Colleagues, and Consequences for Provision of Care. Findings suggest that although attending physicians learned to cope with PPtP, the experience of being treated with bias negatively impacted their well-being and work performance. Attending physicians also felt that white majority medical students sometimes treated them with prejudice but expressed a commitment to protecting vulnerable trainees from PPtP. CONCLUSION: The experience of PPtP occurs consistently throughout a career in medicine, often beginning in the years of training and persisting into the phase of attending status. This makes it imperative to include strategies that address PPtP in order to successfully recruit and retain minoritized physicians.",2024,,Front Public Health,12,,1304107,,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1304107,38469272,#354,Andreae 2024,"",""

Any learning environment, that fulfills the intrinsic and extrinsic needs of the students will probably lead to better and more promising learning outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the student perceptions of Learning Environment (LE) in four health schools of a large university and compare between schools, years of study, and gender. METHODS: Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire and a socio-demographic questionnaire were completed by 1185 undergraduate students enrolled in the school of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences (AMS) of a large university during the academic year 2012-2013. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Independent student t-test or ANOVA (with Tukey post-hoc test) was used for continuous variables at a significance level of p≤0.05. RESULTS: The mean total DREEM score was 89.23±33.3. The total DREEM mean scores for Dentistry (120.54±23.45) and Medicine (110.72±19.33) were higher compared with AMS (63.48±21.36) and Nursing (57.48±22.80) (p=0.000) (Post hoc Tukey p=0.000).

Effect of preconception antibiotics exposure on female reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Alemu BK; Wang CC; Li L; Zhu Z; Li Q; Wang Y,"BACKGROUND: The preconception period is a window of opportunity to influence maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Inappropriate use of antibiotics results in gut dysbiosis and may affect host reproductive health through multiple dimensions. Animal studies demonstrate that antibiotic treatment profoundly affects ovarian functions and the estrous cycle, and it has a direct implication for infertility. Infertility was defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse. However, whether antibiotic exposure in the preconception period influences female fertility, miscarriage, and congenital malformation remains obscure and controversial. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis until April 20, 2024, was conducted by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct without restrictions to designs and language. The risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) tools. The report followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relative risks (RR), odds ratios (OR), and fecundability ratios (FR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were effect size measures determined with a random effect model. Heterogeneity across included studies was assessed using I (2) , T2, and H(2). The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42024515680. FINDINGS: Fifteen studies with a total of 1,206,583 participants were included. Preconception exposure to macrolides reduced the FR by 35% (FR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.88, P < 0.001). Sulfonamide users were also at 2.35 times (OR:2.35, 95% CI: 1.86, 2.97; P < 0.001) more risk of developing infertility. Using beta-lactams other than penicillin G reduced the odds of infertility by 64% (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.26,0.50; P < 0.001). The possibility of infertility among quinolone users was 13% lower (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.99; P = 0.03) than non-users. Preconception antibiotics exposure increased the risk of spontaneous miscarriage by 34% (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.53; P < 0.001). Moreover, trimethoprim intake also increased the odds of congenital malformations by 85% (OR:1.85, 95% CI: 1.54, 2.23; P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Preconception antibiotics exposure in females increases the risk of infertility, miscarriage, and congenital anomalies. Macrolides, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim increase the risk of infertility, spontaneous miscarriage, and congenital malformation while beta-lactams and quinolones reduce the risk. Clinicians, pregnancy planners, and health care policymakers should be warranted for pregnancy needs and success. Further clinical and mechanistic studies are required to illustrate their specific functions and cause effects.

Using a Hybrid Lecture and Small-Group Standardized Patient Case to Teach the Inclusive Sexual History and Transgender Patient Care.,Stumbar SE; Garba NA; Stevens M; Gray E; Uchimaya E; Bhoite P,"OBJECTIVES: Previous negative experiences with the medical community often leave transgender people reluctant to seek medical care. Inadequate teaching and exposure to transgender health during medical training perpetuates the health disparities experienced by this community. Although undergraduate medical education is uniquely positioned to address these disparities, curricular coverage of these topics remains inadequate. METHODS: The second-year clinical skills course at the Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine includes a workshop consisting of a 1-hour lecture about the inclusive sexual history, followed by a 1.5-hour small group during which students interview a standardized patient playing the role of a transgender man and participate in a faculty-facilitated debriefing. To evaluate the 2019 workshop, students were provided with an optional, anonymous, pre- and postsession survey consisting of multiple choice and Likert-type questions. RESULTS: After the session, there was a statistically significant increase in students' knowledge of the components of an inclusive sexual history, in the number of students who believed that their medical training had prepared them to effectively provide care for transgender patients, and in the number who reported feeling comfortable taking a sexual history from a patient who identifies as transgender. Most students thought the standardized patient case was realistic and found the postencounter debriefing session helpful in identifying their own strengths and weaknesses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that students found this brief, interactive sexual history workshop, which included a lecture and standardized patient case, to be an effective component of their medical training. Although our transgender patient case was acted primarily by cis-gender people, students perceived this as a realistic opportunity to actively explore the nuances of obtaining a history from a transgender patient. In addition, our findings suggest that it is possible to merge teaching on sexual history and transgender health care, which is important in time-limited undergraduate medical education curricula.",2021,Jan,South Med J,114,1,17-22,,10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001197,33398355,#359,Stumbar 2021,"",""

PURPOSE: To validate a new digital Preconception Health Assessment Tool (PreCHAT) against the current best practice, physician-delivered tool in Ontario, Canada, and explore how PreCHAT's design impacts its risk identification abilities relative to the comparison tool. METHODS: A criterion validation study was conducted with 53 female participants aged 18-44 years. Participants completed both tools in a controlled setting. PreCHAT was completed on a tablet individually by participants, while the comparison tool was administered by a physician. Three physicians administered the comparison tool. Measures of strength of agreement between PreCHAT and the comparison tool were calculated using percent agreement, Cohen's Kappa, and prevalence-adjusted and biased-adjusted kappa (PABAK). RESULTS: PreCHAT identified 135 individual risk factors, while the comparison tool identified 102. Both tools shared the same 14 domains of preconception care and 88 risk factors; of the 88 risk factors, PreCHAT identified an average of 3.42 (p < 0.0001) more risks per participant than the comparison tool. PABAK scores indicated almost perfect agreement between PreCHAT and the comparison tool. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PreCHAT is valid against the current best practice tool and is broader in its risk identification among individuals of reproductive age.

"Specialty Choice Among Sexual and Gender Minorities in Medicine: The Role of Specialty Prestige, Perceived Inclusion, and Medical School Climate.",Sitkin NA; Pachankis JE,"PURPOSE: Sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) in medicine experience unique stressors in training. However, little is known about SGM specialty choice. This study examined predictors of SGM specialty choice, associations between specialty prestige and perceived SGM inclusion, and self-reported influences on specialty choice. METHODS: Medical trainees and practitioners (358 SGM, 1528 non-SGM) were surveyed online. We operationalized specialty choice at the individual level as respondents' specialty of practice; at the specialty level, as a percentage of SGM respondents in each specialty. We examined specialty prestige, perceived SGM inclusivity, and medical school climate as predictors of SGM specialty choice, and we compared additional influences on specialty choice between SGM and non-SGM. RESULTS: The percentage of SGM in each specialty was inversely related to specialty prestige (P = 0.001) and positively related to perceived SGM inclusivity (P = 0.01). Prestigious specialties were perceived as less SGM inclusive (P < 0.001). Medical school climate did not predict specialty prestige (P = 0.82). SGM were more likely than non-SGM to indicate that sexual and gender identity strongly influenced specialty choice (P < 0.01). SGM most frequently rated personality fit, specialty content, role models, and work-life balance as strong influences on specialty choice. Exposure as a medical student to SGM faculty did not predict specialty prestige among SGM. CONCLUSION: Specialty prestige and perceived inclusivity predict SGM specialty choice. SGM diversity initiatives in prestigious specialties may be particularly effective by addressing SGM inclusion directly. Further research is needed to inform effective mentorship for SGM medical students. Exposure to SGM in medical training reduces anti-SGM bias among medical professionals, and SGM in medicine often assume leadership roles in clinical care, education, and research regarding SGM health. Supporting and promoting SGM diversity across the spectrum of medical specialties, therefore, represents a critical avenue to improve the care delivered to SGM populations and addresses the role of providers in the health disparities experienced by SGM.",2016,Dec,LGBT Health,3,6,451-460,,10.1089/lgbt.2016.0058,27726495,#361,Sitkin 2016,"",""

Intrauterine twin environment and genetic factors subliminally affecting general movements in preterm infants.,Eto E; Maeda T; Kobayashi O; Ihara K,"BACKGROUND: Understanding background factors is beneficial for interpreting general movements (GMs). This study examines the factors involved in preterm-writhing GMs by comparing twins and singletons. METHOD: The subjects were 107 infants cared for at Oita University. The cohort consisted of very-low-birth-weight infants, including twins with a birth weight < 2000 g. The median gestational age (GA) was 29 weeks 1 day. The subjects consisted of 75 singletons, 32 twins (16 pairs), 20 monochorionic twins (M-twins), and 12 dichorionic twins (D-twins). GMs were scored according to the GMs optimality score (GMOS) and integrated into 6 items: the quality, neck-trunk and space, amplitude-speed, rotation, onset-offset and cramped, and tremulous score at 32-34 weeks, 35-36 weeks, and 37-42 weeks' GA. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using integrated GMOS, and the characteristics of clusters were examined according to clinical backgrounds. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 was characterized by good-quality GMs, cluster 2 by a poor repertoire but optimal space and rotatory components, and cluster 3 by overall poor-quality GMs, respectively. The mean GMOSs were 36.6, 31.8 and 24.3 in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There were no marked differences in proportions within clusters with respect to sex and twins. Small-for-gestational age (SGA) was significantly more frequent in cluster 3 at 32-34 weeks' GA than in other clusters. Perinatal brain injury had a significantly lower proportion in cluster 1 and a higher proportion in cluster 3 at 35-36 weeks' GA and 37-42 weeks' GA. M-twin pairs tended to belong to the same clusters at 35-36 weeks' GA. CONCLUSION: Preterm writhing GMs are associated with SGA and perinatal brain injury. Cluster matching in M-twins suggests that certain genetic factors may substantially influence GMs.",2024,Sep,Brain Dev,46,8,255-261,,10.1016/j.braindev.2024.05.002,38705801,#364,Eto 2024,"",""
Perception of educational environment among undergraduate students of health disciplines in an Iranian university.,Farajpour A; Raisolsadat SMA; S Moghadam S; Mostafavian Z,"OBJECTIVES: This paper seeks to determine the perception of Medical, Nursing and Midwifery students about their educational environment and compare their perceptions in terms of disciplines, demographic attributes and academic level. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Medical, Nursing and Midwifery students in Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran, were selected using stratified random sampling method (N=378). They completed the standard Persian version of Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze data. RESULTS: The mean score of DREEM was 106 ± 24.6. The mean scores in five domains of DREEM questionnaire including students' perception of learning, perception of teachers, scientific abilities, students' perception of educational environment and students' perception of social conditions were 23±8, 23.4±6, 18±5.5, 25.5±7.7 and 15.8±4, respectively.

Fostering Inclusivity in PM&R: A National Survey.,Adeniyi A; Fuentes S; Farah R; Lawani S; Sosa O; Puckerine M; Stein J; von Rickenbach KJ,"There is a persistent underrepresentation of women and multiple ethnic minority groups among medical school and residency applicants and trainees, particularly in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R). There is limited information on what causes these demographic disparities in PM&R and on strategies to increase interest in the field. To address this gap and improve early recruitment efforts, the authors conducted the first-ever national survey to gather information on pre-medical students' perceived barriers to medical school admissions, career interests, perceptions of PM&R, and strategies to increase interest in PM&R. The survey received 1093 responses from 236 colleges with a diverse representation of participants, including 53.3% (n = 583) from historically underrepresented groups such as those Underrepresented in Medicine (URiM), and those from rural communities, and/or low socioeconomic backgrounds.

Outcomes in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomies: challenging preconceived notions.,Gross DJ; Chang EH; Rosen PL; Roudnitsky V; Muthusamy M; Sugiyama G; Chung PJ,"BACKGROUND: Most thoracic surgical procedures in the United States are being performed by general surgeons (GSs) without any advanced training. With the recent approval of computed tomography screening for lung malignancy in high-risk populations, the number of thoracic oncologic resections is expected to rise. Previous literature has demonstrated consistently worsened outcomes for patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedure when done by nonthoracic fellowship-trained surgeons. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database, we examined short-term outcomes in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project from 2010-2015. We identified patients who had an International Classification of Disease 9 diagnosis of lung cancer (162) who underwent VATS lobectomy (current procedural terminology 32663). We included only adults (≥18y) and elective cases. We excluded patients who had preoperative diagnosis of sepsis, contaminated wound class, or those patients with missing American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, morbid obesity, functional status, length of stay (LOS), or sex, and race information. We identified two groups by specialty: GS versus cardiothoracic (CT) surgeon. We then performed univariate analysis. We then performed propensity score analysis using a 1:3 ratio of general surgery patients to CT patients. Outcomes of interest included 30-d postoperative mortality, 30-d postoperative morbidity, and LOS. RESULTS: A total of 4105 patients were identified, 607 performed by GSs, 3508 performed by CT surgeons. The mean age for patients who underwent lobectomies by GSs was 68.6 versus 67.8 in the CT surgeon group (P < 0.05). The majority were female (58.09% GS versus 57.74% CT surgeon). There was a statistically significant difference in race between groups; patients were more likely to be African American in the CT surgeon group. Operative time was lower in the GS group as opposed to the CT surgeon group 179 min versus 196 (P < 0.01). Univariate analysis (mortality <0.1 CT surgeon and GS) and 1:3 propensity score matched analysis (0.08 GS% versus 0.08% CT surgeon) failed to demonstrate a significant difference in mortality. There was a statistically significant difference in median LOS between groups (6.2 GS versus 5.1 CT surgeon). Univariate and propensity matched analyses of pneumonia, sepsis, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, transfusion requirement, myocardial infarction stroke, postoperative renal insufficiency, failure to wean, pulmonary embolism, reintubation, and deep organ space infection all failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between our groups of interest. Urinary tract infection was noted to be higher in the GS group operating room 2.29 as compared to the CT surgeon group (P value 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational study, we found that VATS lobectomies performed by GS compared to the matched CT surgeon cohort had shorter operative time, and there was no difference in major postoperative morbidity or mortality. However, LOS was higher and there was increased risk of urinary tract infection in the GS compared to matched CT surgeon cohort.",2018,Nov,J Surg Res,231,,161-166,,10.1016/j.jss.2018.05.040,30278924,#367,Gross 2018,"",""
Effect of embryo culture media on percentage of males at birth.,Zhu J; Zhuang X; Chen L; Liu P; Qiao J,"STUDY QUESTION: Does embryo culture medium influence the percentage of males at birth? SUMMARY ANSWER: The percentage of males delivered after ICSI cycles using G5™ medium was statistically significantly higher than after cycles where Global, G5™ PLUS, and Quinn's Advantage Media were used. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Male and female embryos have different physiologies during preimplantation development. Manipulating the energy substrate and adding growth factors have a differential impact on the development of male and female embryos. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This was a retrospective analysis of the percentage of males at birth, and included 4411 singletons born from fresh embryo transfer cycles between January 2011 and August 2013 at the Center for Reproductive Medicine of Third Hospital Peking University. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS: Only singleton gestations were included. Participants were excluded if preimplantation genetic diagnosis, donor oocytes and donor sperm were used. The database between January 2011 and August 2013 was searched with unique medical record number, all patients were present in the database with only one cycle. Demographics, cycle characteristics and the percentage of male babies in the four culture media groups were compared with analysis of variance or χ(2) tests. Multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the association between the sex at birth and culture media after adjusting for other confounding factors, including parental age, parental BMI, type of infertility, parity, number of embryos transferred, number of early gestational sacs, cycles with testicular sperm aspiration (TESA)/percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA)/testicular sperm extraction (TESE), number of oocytes retrieved, cycles with blastocyst transfers, and gestational age within ICSI group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Within the IVF group, the percentage of males at birth for G5™, Global, Quinn's and G5™ PLUS media were comparable (P > 0.05); however, within the ICSI group, the percentage of male babies in cycles using G5™(56.1%) was statistically significantly higher than in cycles that used Global (47.2%; P = 0.003), G5™ PLUS (47.7%; P = 0.005) or Quinn's media (45.0%; P = 0.009). There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of males at birth between cycles that used Global, G5™ PLUS and Quinn's media (P > 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression indicated that culture media (G5™ versus Global, G5™ PLUS, and Quinn's) were significantly associated with the sex at birth (P = 0.008) after adjusting for parental age, parental BMI, type of infertility, parity, number of embryos transferred, number of early gestational sacs, cycles with TESA/PESA/TESE, number of oocytes retrieved, cycles with blastocyst transfers, and gestational age. LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was not a randomized controlled trial and allocation of treatment cycles over the four media was not completely at random. Cigarette smoking was not included in the current study because this confounding factor was not registered in our database. Moreover, intra-variability of sperm selection between the five embryologists may directly affect the percentage of males. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS: Our study suggests that human embryogenesis responds differently to G5™, Global, G5™ PLUS and Quinn's Advantage Medium. This finding can be generalized to other commercial culture media. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars (81300483 and 81200466).

"Developing and conducting a language inclusivity assessment on a health science library's website, LibGuides, and signage.",Morgan-Daniel J; Norton HF; Edwards ME; Daley M,"BACKGROUND: A Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Team at a university health science library created a checklist for inclusive language and conducted an assessment of their library's website, LibGuides, and physical and digital signage. Inclusive language was defined as ""language that is free from words, phrases or tones that reflect prejudiced, stereotyped or discriminatory views of particular people or groups"". CASE PRESENTATION: The 32-item checklist facilitated the identification of gendered language, stereotypes, ableist language, racist language, stigmatizing language, slang, acronyms, and out-of-date terminology regarding physical and mental health conditions. From the library's website, 20 instances were noted for which improvements were necessary. Out of the 130 LibGuides reviewed, 23 LibGuides had no changes needed and 107 had changes identified relating to language inclusivity (14 strongly recommended changes and 116 suggested changes). Regarding the signage, one flyer was removed for reprinting. CONCLUSION: The checklist enabled the team to implement a number of improvements to the library's website and LibGuides. The checklist has been shared with Library Technology Services and the wider campus libraries' Usability Committee for future use, and has also been added to the DEI Team's LibGuide for use by others outside of the university.",2024,Jan,J Med Libr Assoc,112,1,48-54,,10.5195/jmla.2024.1691,38911523,#369,Morgan-Daniel 2024,"",""

Evaluating the educational environment in a residency programme in Singapore: can we help reduce burnout rates?,Ong AM; Fong WW; Chan AK; Phua GC; Tham CK,"INTRODUCTION: The educational environment (EE) reflects the quality of a residency programme and has an association with burnout. Studying the EE allows for interventions to target specific weaknesses. We aimed to measure the EE of an internal medicine residency programme in Singapore, compare the perceptions between genders, residency grades and levels of work experience, and identify specific areas of weaknesses for intervention in hopes of reducing residency burnout rates in Singapore. METHODS: This study took place between October and December 2017. We adopted a mixed methods approach, quantitatively using the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM), and qualitative exploration using semi-structured focus group discussion. RESULTS: A total of 136 (88.9%) out of 153 residents responded. Our total PHEEM scores (112.23 ± 16.71), along with the scores for all three subscales, were higher than those of institutions in previous studies. There were no differences in overall PHEEM and subscale scores between genders, residency grades or levels of work experience. However, there were differences for individual questions, which were explored in the focus group discussion. Senior residents juggling heavier workloads, responsibilities and examinations appeared to be most prone to burnout. We identified three recurring themes that contributed to a poor EE in our programme: excessive workload, poor faculty relationships and differing unmet needs. CONCLUSION: Although our programme had a good EE, there were also areas of weaknesses revealed by specific questions, possibly contributing to burnout. We hope to implement interventions to these areas and subsequently assess for longitudinal changes in EE and burnout rates.",2020,Sep,Singapore Med J,61,9,476-482,,10.11622/smedj.2019094,31388684,#372,Ong 2020,"",""

The membership's experiences of inclusion, belonging, professional opportunities, discrimination, microaggressions, racism, and harassment in their professional lives are presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ethics-reviewed survey was distributed in English and French to full members of COMP. Participants responded to questions covering demographics and professional climate. Simple descriptive statistics were used to measure frequency of responses. Data pertaining to impressions on the climate within the profession were compared using nonparametric statistical tests. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 649 eligible members; 243 (37%) responded, and 214 (33%) provided full response sets. From the full response sets, findings showed that in general, age, highest academic degree, and racial and ethnic distribution trends of medical physicists were comparable with previously collected data and/or the Canadian population.

Postgraduate medical trainees at a Ugandan university perceive their clinical learning environment positively but differentially despite challenging circumstances: a cross-sectional study.,Alele PE; Kiptoo J; Hill-Besinque K,"PURPOSE: The clinical learning environment is an essential component in health professions' education. Data are scant on how postgraduate trainees in sub-Saharan Africa perceive their medical school learning environments, and how those perceptions contribute to their engagement during training, their emotional wellbeing, and career aspirations. This study examined perceptions of postgraduate medical trainees (residents) in a resource-limited setting, regarding their learning environment and explored perceptual contributions to their career engagement during training. The data reported contribute to understanding how clinical learning environments can be improved in low-resource settings in Uganda and elsewhere. METHODS: This study was done at the Faculty of Medicine of Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda. We used a descriptive cross-sectional design involving sequential mixed methods. Quantitative data were collected using the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM). Qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions. RESULTS: Ninety of the 113 eligible residents responded (79.6%).

Saudi women first entered the medical field in 1975 and the country has since seen a steady increase in women pursuing medicine. However, there is limited data on gender related issues for women doctors practicing in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, our study objective was to assess the perception amongst peers regarding gender equality and social issues faced by women doctors in Saudi Arabia. An online anonymous cross-sectional survey was administered in English to doctors at King Khalid Hospital, affiliated to King Saud University, in Riyadh, between April and May of 2016. Of 1015 doctors, 304 (30%) participated, of which 129 (42.4%) were females and 231 (76%) were Saudi nationals. The average age was 32.4 years (±SD: 8.7). The majority opined that there was no gender discrimination in salaries (73.7% p-value = 0.4), hospital benefits (62.2% p-value = 0.06) or entry into any field of Medicine/Pediatrics (68.4% p-value = 0.207). However, only a minority believed that there was no gender discrimination for entry into surgery (37.3% p-value = .091).

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study with medical students from four different periods of the course, using the questionnaire DREEM and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: 210 students participated. Although DREEM's overall score shows that students have a more positive rather than negative view of EE in general, there was a large discrepancy in results among the groups surveyed, indicating that the more students progress in the medical course, the more negative your view on the educational environment. The perception about the general teaching environment and social relations was negative in the four groups. Female students, white, and those who lived outside Rio de Janeiro before attending in medical school perceived EE more negatively. The perception of EE by students who entered the system of racial or social quotas and those who did not join the quota system was similar. Conclusion: the analysis of the educational environment the students' dissatisfaction with the traditional Flexnerian models.

"""We have knowledge that is unique"": Patient activism and the promotion of trans-inclusive primary care.",Blus-Kadosh I; Hartal G,"Despite growing visibility of the trans population in Israel, there has been limited research on trans healthcare in a local context, particularly in the field of primary care medicine. Primary care encompasses services provided in locally distributed clinics and has a crucial role in providing both preventive and specialized healthcare. The aim of this study is to outline barriers to trans-inclusive primary care and measures employed by the trans community to overcome them. Biopower and counter-conduct are used as analytical frameworks to examine the trans-exclusionary features of the Israeli healthcare system and steps taken to resist it. To examine these issues, 19 medical care professionals and 20 trans people and activists were interviewed, and a variety of relevant texts were analyzed. Our results indicate trans-exclusionary features in primary healthcare, such as ambiguity regarding trans-inclusive services offered, sex-specific treatments, and lack of medical training programs dedicated to the trans population. To overcome these difficulties, the Israeli trans community has accumulated communal experiential knowledge and transferred it to physicians and policymakers in a localized and informal manner. We argue that by using informal practices, the trans community can provide support and information to its own members as well as operate alongside power systems, albeit in a slow and lengthy manner. More generally, the findings of this study highlight howf patient activism is employed by marginalized populations, who face not only health disparities, but institutional discrimination as well.",2024,Mar,Soc Sci Med,344,,116654,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.116654,38335715,#379,Blus-Kadosh 2024,"",""
Effect of ulipristal acetate and mifepristone at emergency contraception dose on the embryo-endometrial attachment using an in vitro human trophoblastic spheroid and endometrial cell co-culture model.,Li HWR; Li YX; Li TT; Fan H; Ng EH; Yeung WS; Ho PC; Lee KF,"STUDY QUESTION: Do both ulipristal acetate (UPA) and mifepristone inhibit embryo-endometrial attachment at concentrations corresponding to the emergency contraception (EC) dose? SUMMARY ANSWER: Both UPA and mifepristone at concentrations corresponding to the EC dose do not have an inhibitory effect on embryo implantation, although mifepristone at a higher concentration appeared to have such an effect. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Levonorgestrel is commonly used for EC, but it only acts through inhibition of ovulation. UPA and mifepristone have higher efficacy as EC compared to levonorgestrel; while there is some suggestion that mifepristone may interfere with implantation, whether UPA has post-ovulatory action in inhibiting implantation is yet to be confirmed. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: An in vitro experimental study using trophoblastic spheroids made from JAr cell line as the embryo surrogate, and the Ishikawa cell line and primary human endometrial cells cultured to monolayer as the endometrial surrogate. The primary endometrial cells were collected from nine volunteer women in the mid-luteal phase with consent. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study was conducted in a university gynaecology unit. The JAr and Ishikawa cell lines (or primary endometrial cells) were treated with graded concentrations of UPA (0, 0.04, 0.4 and 4 μM) or mifepristone (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM) for 24 h. Embryo-endometrial attachment was studied using an in vitro JAr spheroid-endometrial co-culture model. Expressions of progesterone receptor, β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) were studied with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In the Ishikawa experiments, there was no significant difference in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA at 0 (93.0%), 0.04 (93.6%), 0.4 (93.4%) and 4 (91.4%) μM concentrations (P > 0.05); the attachment rate was reduced after treatment with mifepristone only at 10 μM (79.8%, P < 0.0001) but not at 0.1 (92.1%) or 1.0 (95.2%) μM concentrations. In the primary endometrial cell experiments, again no significant difference was observed in the JAr spheroid attachment rate after treatment with UPA 4 μM (42.6%) compared to control (46.5%, P > 0.05). Both UPA and mifepristone could significantly up-regulate progesterone receptor expression. There was no significant alteration in expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β after treatment with UPA 4 μM or mifepristone 10 μM (P > 0.05). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The co-culture model is only a surrogate which may not fully represent the complicated process of embryo implantation in vivo, although there is no existing perfect model for studying implantation in vitro which fully resembles the latter. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The lack of inhibitory effect on embryo implantation by UPA and possibly mifepristone at concentrations corresponding to the EC dose is an important information for contraceptive counseling.

[Comparison of Candida Polymerase Chain Reaction Method and Blood Culture in Patients with High Risk of Candidemia in Intensive Care Unit].,Şimşek Bozok T; Kuşcu F; Bozok T; Kömür S; Candevir A; Seza İnal A; Kurtaran B; Kibar F; Taşova Y,"Candida species are responsible for 70-90% of invasive fungal infections in the intensive care unit. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in candidemia. Improper diagnosis and treatment increases mortality and morbidity significantly. Because of the late results of blood cultures and low sensitivity of the serological tests when used alone, molecular methods should be investigated in this field. In this study, the results of the Candida real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) test, which was studied from blood culture and whole blood, were compared in patients with high candidemia risk who were followed in the General Surgery Intensive Care and Anesthesiology and Reanimation Unit of Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine. It was aimed to investigate the practical utility of Candida RT-PCR test, which is a rapid diagnosis method in patients with suspected candidemia. In our study, 90 patients with high risk of candidemia according to the criteria determined according to the guidelines were evaluated prospectively. Urine, perineum, axilla, tracheal aspirate culture and two sets of blood cultures were obtained from the patients. Blood sample was also drawn into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube and stored at -40°C for later Candida Rt-PCR study. In Candida Rt- PCR, species-specific primers were used to distinguish species. Candida score (CS) of the patients was calculated. Forty one (45.5%) of the patients were female and 49 (55.5%) were male. The median age of the patients was 61.5 years. Candida was positive in blood culture in three (3.3%) of the patients included in the study, while Candida Rt-PCR was positive in 17 (18.9%). Candida species detected in the blood culture and Rt-PCR test were compatible with each other. Rt-PCR was significantly more positive (p= 0.006). Candida Rt-PCR positivity was significantly higher in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (p= 0.028), malignancy (p= 0.021), and history of surgery in the last three months (p=0.003). The difference in CS between patients with PCR positive and PCR negative was statistically significant (p= 0.015). Our study was conducted in a high-risk population for candidemia and the results of Candida Rt-PCR was found to be more positive than blood culture. Rt-PCR positivity and blood culture positivity were associated with high CS. In the light of these data, it was thought that it would be appropriate to use molecular methods in the diagnosis and support them with CS, especially in patients with high risk of candidemia. Considering that blood culture, which is the gold standard for the diagnosis of candidemia, gives late results and is 50% positive, using faster diagnostic methods for candidemia is important to reduce mortality and morbidity. The fast and good results of Candida PCR method have shown that it can be used in diagnosis. However, lack of standardization of primers used in PCR tests may cause false positives. Additional studies are needed in this respect.",2021,Oct,Mikrobiyol Bul,55,4,568-579,,10.5578/mb.20219708,34666656,#382,ŞimşekBozok 2021,"",""
What I say is not what I do: Gender differences in the home mathematics environment.,Varnell S; Ehrman P; Kumar SC; Sandel J; Ellis A; Purpura DJ,"Consistent evidence shows that women are underrepresented across most Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. Research indicates that early attitudes and gendered beliefs about mathematics can predict later achievement and academic choices in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and that children's attitudes are tied to parents' beliefs and interactions with their children surrounding math. To identify potential antecedents of gender differences, we examined whether there are differences between parents of sons and parents of daughters on factors in the home mathematics environment that influence early math experiences for young children. This study used a subset of a publicly available data set, the Early Home Learning Environment, with 929 parents (68% female, 86% White) of 1- to 6-year-old children. Parents rated their beliefs about the importance of mathematics and the appropriateness of various mathematics activities for their children and reported the frequency with which they engage in mathematics activities with their children. We examined whether there were child gender differences in parents' mathematics beliefs, appropriateness ratings, and frequency of numeracy, spatial/geometry, patterning, and measurement activities through a series of between-subjects analyses of variance. Although we found no gender differences in parent ratings of appropriateness of activities or beliefs in the importance of patterning and spatial activities, we did find significant differences in what parents reported doing with boys versus girls after age 4 in the areas of numeracy and measurement. These findings indicate that parents did more numeracy and measurement activities with boys than girls, even though they reported believing that the activities were equally important.

On Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records and the Experienced Effect on the Work Environment of Nurses.,Moll J; Cajander Å,"The work environment for nurses is challenging, and even though new technology has major advantages, it has often also caused new stressors and problems for nurses. When Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records (PAEHR) was introduced in Sweden, research showed that nurses were worried about possible negative effects for patients as well as on their work. However, to this date there are very few follow up studies on the more long term effects of PAEHR, despite research pointing to the fact that reactions after long term use might differ from initial experiences. In this paper we present an interview study to fill this research gap. An analysis based on interviews with physicians and nurses in Oncology care reveals three areas where nurses' work is experienced to have been affected: 1) nurses receive more questions from patients after PAEHR has been introduced, 2) nurses have changed their documentation practices and 3) the log list functionality has made nurses feel questioned.

Assessing the Culture of Residency Using the C - Change Resident Survey: Validity Evidence in 34 U.S. Residency Programs.,Pololi LH; Evans AT; Civian JT; Shea S; Brennan RT,"BACKGROUND: A practical instrument is needed to reliably measure the clinical learning environment and professionalism for residents. OBJECTIVE: To develop and present evidence of validity of an instrument to assess the culture of residency programs and the clinical learning environment. DESIGN: During 2014-2015, we surveyed residents using the C - Change Resident Survey to assess residents' perceptions of the culture in their programs. PARTICIPANTS: Residents in all years of training in 34 programs in internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery in 14 geographically diverse public and private academic health systems. MAIN MEASURES: The C - Change Resident Survey assessed residents' perceptions of 13 dimensions of the culture: Vitality, Self-Efficacy, Institutional Support, Relationships/Inclusion, Values Alignment, Ethical/Moral Distress, Respect, Mentoring, Work-Life Integration, Gender Equity, Racial/Ethnic Minority Equity, and self-assessed Competencies. We measured the internal reliability of each of the 13 dimensions and evaluated response process, content validity, and construct-related evidence validity by assessing relationships predicted by our conceptual model and prior research. We also assessed whether the measurements were sensitive to differences in specialty and across institutions. KEY RESULTS: A total of 1708 residents completed the survey [internal medicine: n = 956, pediatrics: n = 411, general surgery: n = 311 (51% women; 16% underrepresented in medicine minority)], with a response rate of 70% (range across programs, 51-87%). Internal consistency of each dimension was high (Cronbach α: 0.73-0.90). The instrument was able to detect significant differences in the learning environment across programs and sites. Evidence of validity was supported by a good response process and the demonstration of several relationships predicted by our conceptual model.

"At age 9, the methylome of assisted reproductive technology children that underwent embryo culture in different media is not significantly different on a genome-wide scale.",Koeck RM; Busato F; Tost J; Zandstra H; Remy S; Langie S; Gielen M; van Golde R; Dumoulin JCM; Brunner H; Zamani Esteki M; van Montfoort APA,"STUDY QUESTION: Can we detect DNA methylation differences between ART children that underwent embryo culture in different media? SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified no significant differences in site-specific or regional DNA methylation between the different culture medium groups. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium leads to differences in embryonic, neonatal and childhood outcomes, including growth and weight. The methylome may mediate this association as the period of in vitro culture of ART treatments coincides with epigenetic reprogramming. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous culture medium comparison study in which couples were pseudo-randomized to embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium. Of the resultant singletons, 120 (n = 65 G3, n = 55 K-SICM), were recruited at age 9. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The ART children provided a saliva sample from which the methylome was analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After quality and context filtering, 106 (n = 57 G3, n = 49 K-SICM) samples and 659 708 sites were retained for the analyses. Differential methylation analyses were conducted using mixed effects linear models corrected for age, sex, sample plate and cell composition. These were applied to all cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, various genomic regions (genes, promoters, CpG Islands (CGIs)) and as a targeted analysis of imprinted genes and birth weight-associated CpG sites. Differential variance was assessed using the improved epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis (iEVORA) algorithm and methylation outliers were identified using a previously defined threshold (upper or lower quartile plus or minus three times the interquartile range, respectively). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After correcting for multiple testing, we did not identify any significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, genes, promoters or CGIs between G3 and K-SICM children despite a lenient corrected P-value threshold of 0.1. Targeted analyses of (sites within) imprinted genes and birth weight-associated sites also did not identify any significant differences. The number of DNA methylation outliers per sample was comparable between the culture medium groups. iEVORA identified 101 differentially variable CpG sites of which 94 were more variable in the G3 group. LARGE SCALE DATA: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE196432. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: To detect significant methylation differences with a magnitude of <10% between the groups many more participants would be necessary; however, the clinical relevance of such small differences is unclear. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of this study are reassuring, suggesting that if there is an effect of the culture medium on DNA methylation (and methylation-mediated diseases risk), it does not differ between the two media investigated here. The findings concur with other methylome studies of ART neonates and children that underwent embryo culture in different media, which also found no significant methylome differences.

A Mixed Methods Evaluation of an Inclusive Sexual History Taking and HIV Prevention Curriculum for Trainees.,Frasca K; Castillo-Mancilla J; McNulty MC; Connors S; Sweitzer E; Zimmer S; Madinger N,"BACKGROUND: Health disparities exist in HIV risk in the USA among the lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer (LGBTQ) community. There is also scarce literature on curricula for HIV prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for trainees. AIM: To create a curriculum to train residents to perform inclusive sexual history taking and HIV prevention care. The curriculum covers sexual history, LGBTQ health, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV risk assessment and risk reduction counseling including use of PrEP. SETTING: A dedicated PrEP Clinic was created within an Academic Medical Center Outpatient HIV Clinic. Patients were primarily LGBTQ identified, but also included HIV sero-discordant couples, cisgender individuals, heterosexual invididuals, and those with experience of homelessness, sex work, and substance abuse. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four internal medicine residents completed the course between November 2017 and May 2018. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The curriculum was delivered as Just in Time Teaching (JiTT) via online virtual patient cases followed by directly observed clinical care at a large urban PrEP clinic.

OBJECTIVES: To assess undergraduate medical students' perception toward PBL sessions and to compare their perceptions among different sex and grade point average (GPA) in the college of medicine, Al-Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on a self-administered anonymous online questionnaire during the first semester of the 2017-2018 academic year in IMSIU. The data were collected from male and female students of the second and third year, as well as male students of the fourth year. RESULTS: Out of 259 students, 152 (58.7%) completed the questionnaire. The students' perception toward PBL was more positive than negative. Most of the students reported that PBL sessions increased their knowledge of basic sciences (P=0.03). Furthermore, most students agreed that PBL provided a better integration between basic and clinical sciences which differed significantly between the different GPA groups (P=0.02). Nevertheless, only 28.3% of the students agreed that the teaching staff is well prepared to run the sessions with significant statistical difference among different GPA groups (P=0.02). Moreover, only 26.3% of the students reported that there was proper student training before starting the PBL sessions with no significant difference. Additionally, only 34.2% and 28.9% of the students felt that they learn better and gain more knowledge thorough PBL than lectures respectively, with no significant difference. CONCLUSION: This study showed that tutors should be trained to guide the process of PBL effectively to achieve its goals. Moreover, students should be securely introduced to PBL and experience the development of their clinical reasoning through PBL.

"Maude Abbott: ""A Feminine Misfit in an Exclusive Male Environment"" and Her Strategies for Success.",Wright JR Jr,"Maude Abbott was a pioneering female Canadian physician who became a world authority on medical museums and congenital heart disease. Abbott spent almost all her career in highly sexist, discriminatory work environments. This paper reviews Abbott's life and accomplishments, but, more importantly, analyzes her pathway to success in the masculine world of early 20th-century academic pathology. Abbott, though well-trained as a pathologist, never provided clinical service, but instead worked as museum curator at McGill University. She established the International Association of Medical Museums (predecessor to the International Academy of Pathology), edited its journal, and essentially ran the organization. Abbott, surrounded by influential males, dealt differently with each. In general, she recognized that male doctors believed women lacked the gravitas to lead major initiatives but that she could circumnavigate this supposed impediment by co-leading projects with male counterparts, preferably ones too busy to get in her way.

Eliminating LGBTIQQ Health Disparities: The Associated Roles of Electronic Health Records and Institutional Culture.,Callahan EJ; Hazarian S; Yarborough M; Sánchez JP,"For all humans, sexual orientation and gender identity are essential elements of identity, informing how we plan and live our lives. The historic invisibility of sexual minorities in medicine has meant that these important aspects of their identities as patients have been ignored, with the result that these patients have been denied respect, culturally competent services, and proper treatment. Likely due to historic rejection and mistreatment, there is evidence of reluctance on the part of LGBT patients to disclose their sexual orientation (SO) or gender identity (GI) to their health care providers. There is some perception of risk in sharing SO and GI for many patients who have had bad prior experiences. Despite these risks, we argue that we can improve the quality of care provided this population only by encouraging them to self-identify and then using that information to improve quality of care. One strategy both to prompt patient self-identification and to store and use SO and GI data to improve care centers on the use of electronic health records. However, gathering SO and GI data in the EHR requires a workforce that knows both how to obtain and how to use that information. To develop these competencies, educational programs for health professionals must prepare students and educators to elicit and to use sexual orientation and gender identity information to improve care while simultaneously ensuring the safety of patients, trainees, and staff and faculty members as SO and GI become openly discussed and integral parts of ongoing medical discussion and care. As determination of SO and GI demographics becomes more common in health research, we will more fully understand the health risks for all the LGBTIQQ populations.",2014,Sep,Hastings Cent Rep,44 Suppl 4,,S48-52,,10.1002/hast.371,25231788,#393,Callahan 2014,"",""
Focus on patient perspectives in climate action policies for healthcare. A German survey analysis on what patients are willing to do.,Scholz F; Börner N; Schust SA; Schardey J; Kühn F; Renz B; Angele M; Werner J; Guba M; Jacob S,"BACKGROUND: The healthcare sector, while dedicated to improving health, paradoxically contributes significantly to global carbon emissions, accounting for approximately 4.9% of global emissions. Despite growing public concern about climate change, few studies have explored patients' awareness and attitudes toward the environmental impact of healthcare. This study aims to assess patients' perspectives on climate change and the sustainability of healthcare practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Hospital in Munich, Germany. Patients were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous online survey via strategically placed QR codes throughout the hospital. The survey explored patients' demographic information, environmental awareness, attitudes toward climate-friendly practices in healthcare, and willingness to support sustainable initiatives. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 399 patients completed the survey (87% completion rate). The majority of respondents (92.3%) were aware of climate change, and 82.7% reported prioritizing climate-friendly practices in their personal lives. However, 55.9% of respondents were unaware of the healthcare system's contribution to carbon emissions, and only 18.3% knew about hospitals' climate impact. Despite this, 88.2% of respondents supported environmentally friendly initiatives in hospitals, and 86.5% were open to sustainable alternatives, provided that quality standards were maintained. Participants expressed significant interest in knowing the environmental impact of their treatments, with 63.2% in favor of a Nutri-Score-like system that would display the carbon footprint of medical procedures. Among those, 54.4% indicated that such a system would influence their choice of treatment. Similarly, 62.2% of respondents were interested in knowing the environmental impact of their medications, with 65% reporting that this information would affect their medication choices. A notable proportion of patients (66.2%) indicated willingness to support sustainable healthcare through shorter hospital stays and increased follow-up visits, while 35.8% were open to paying a CO(2) compensation fee for their treatments. However, 81% were unwilling to pay higher insurance premiums to support environmentally friendly practices in hospitals. Regression analyses revealed that older age groups and having children were positively associated with environmental awareness (p < 0.05). However, factors such as gender, education level, relationship status, and illness severity did not significantly impact environmental attitudes. There was a significant correlation between patients' environmental friendliness and their readiness to take climate-protective actions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study highlights a gap between patients' environmental awareness and their knowledge of healthcare's carbon footprint. While patients are generally supportive of sustainable practices in healthcare, their willingness to act diminishes when personal costs or discomfort are involved. A coordinated approach involving policy changes, patient education, and market innovations is essential to promote sustainable practices in healthcare without compromising patient care quality. Further research is needed to explore strategies for bridging the gap between environmental awareness and action in healthcare settings.",2024,,Front Public Health,12,,1477313,,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1477313,39659718,#394,Scholz 2024,"",""
"Nursing students' perceptions of their educational environment in the bachelor's programs of the Shifa College of Nursing, Pakistan.",Victor G; Ishtiaq M; Parveen S,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate nursing students' perceptions of their educational environment in a private college. Perceptions were compared between genders and 2 bachelor's programs. METHODS: A total of 219 students participated in this study, drawn from the Generic Bachelor of Science in Nursing (GBSN) and the Post-Registered Nurse Bachelor of Science in Nursing (PRBSN) programs of the Shifa College of Nursing, Islamabad, Pakistan. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure was utilized for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate total scores, as well as means and standard deviations, and the t-test was applied for comparisons according to program and gender. RESULTS: The overall total mean score (119 of 200) is suggestive of more positive than negative perceptions of the educational environment. The mean score of 13 of 28 on the social self-perception subscale suggests that the social environment was felt to be 'not a nice place.' The t-test revealed more positive perceptions among students enrolled in the PRBSN program (P<0.0001) than among those enrolled in the GBSN program and more positive perceptions among female students than among male students (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Commonalities and differences were found in the perceptions of the nursing students. Both positive and negative perceptions were reported; the overall sense of a positive environment was present, but the social component requires immediate attention, along with other unsatisfactory components. Establishing a supportive environment conducive to competence-based learning would play an important role in bringing desirable changes to the educational environment.",2017,,J Educ Eval Health Prof,13,,43,,10.3352/jeehp.2016.13.43,28013314,#395,Victor 2017,"",""

Values and value conflicts in implementation and use of preconception expanded carrier screening - an expert interview study.,Matar A; Hansson MG; Höglund AT,"BACKGROUND: Endeavors have been made to found and incorporate ethical values in most aspects of healthcare, including health technology assessment. Health technologies and their assessment are value-laden and could trigger problems with dissemination if they contradict societal norms. Per WHO definition, preconception expanded carrier screening is a new health technology that warrants assessment. It is a genetic test offered to couples who have no known risk of recessive genetic diseases and are interested pregnancy. A test may screen for carrier status of several autosomal recessive diseases and X-linked at one go. The technique has been piloted in the Netherlands and is discussed in other countries. The aim of the study was to examine values and value conflicts that healthcare experts recounted in relation to the discussion of implementation and use of preconception ECS in Sweden. METHODS: We interviewed ten experts, who were associated with influencing health policymaking in Sweden. We employed systematizing expert interviews, which endeavor to access experts' specialist knowledge. There were four female and six male informants, of which four were physicians, three bioethicists, one a legal expert, one a theologian and one a political party representative in the parliament. The participants functioned as members of two non-governmental bodies and three governmental organizations. We employed thematic analysis to identify themes, categories and subcategories. RESULTS: Two main themes surfaced: values and value conflicts. The main categories of Respect for persons, Solidarity, Human dignity, Do no harm, Health and Love formed the first theme, while values conflicting with autonomy and integrity respectively, constituted the second theme. Concepts relating to respect for persons were the most commonly mentioned among the participants, followed by notions alluding to solidarity. Furthermore, respondents discussed values conflicting with Swedish healthcare ones such as equality and solidarity. CONCLUSIONS: The experts highlighted values and concepts that are distinctive of welfare states such as Sweden and delineated how preconception ECS could challenge such values. Moreover, the analysis revealed that certain values were deemed more substantive than others, judging by the extent and detail of inference; for example, respect for persons and solidarity were on top of the list.",2019,Apr,BMC Med Ethics,20,1,25,,10.1186/s12910-019-0362-1,31014326,#397,Matar 2019,"",""
Protocol for Assessing the Relative Effects of Environment and Genetics on Antler and Body Growth for a Long-lived Cervid.,Michel ES; Flinn EB; Demarais S; Strickland BK; Wang G; Dacus CM,"Cervid phenotype can be placed into one of two categories: efficiency, which promotes survival over extravagant morphometric growth, and luxury, which promotes growth of large weaponry and body size. Populations of the same species display each phenotype depending on environmental conditions. Although antler and body size of male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) varies by physiographic region in Mississippi, USA and is strongly correlated with regional variation in nutritional quality, the effects of population-level genetics from native stocks and previous re-stocking efforts cannot be disregarded. This protocol describes how we designed a controlled study, where other factors that influence phenotype, such as age and nutrition, are controlled. We brought wild-caught pregnant females and six-month-old fawns from three distinct physiographic regions in Mississippi, USA to the Mississippi State University Rusty Dawkins Memorial Deer Unit. Deer from the same region were bred to produce a second generation of offspring, allowing us to assess generational responses and maternal effects. All deer ate the same high-quality (20% crude protein deer pellet) diet ad libitum. We uniquely marked each neonate and recorded body mass, hind foot, and total body length. Each subsequent fall, we sedated individuals via remote injection and sampled the same morphometrics plus antlers of adults. We found that all morphometrics increased in size from first to second generation, with full compensation of antler size (regional variation no longer present) and partial compensation of body mass (some evidence of regional variation) evident in the second generation. Second generation males that originated from our poorest quality soil region displayed about a 40% increase in antler size and about a 25% increase in body mass when compared to their wild harvested counterparts. Our results suggest phenotypic variation of wild male white-tailed deer in Mississippi are more related to differences in nutritional quality than population-level genetics.",2017,Aug,J Vis Exp,,126,,,10.3791/56059,28809837,#398,Michel 2017,"",""

The best learning environment is created when students are involved in the evaluation process of their education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate students' perceptions of their learning environment at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Riyadh using the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) instrument. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using the Arabic version of the DREEM tool. Students from six colleges at KSAU-HS Riyadh campus were asked to complete the questionnaire through emails. The study was carried out between November 2021 and April 2022. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were performed for DREEM as both a continuous (two-way ANOVA test) and categorical variable (Chi-squared and Monte-Carlo test). RESULTS: A total of 370 students completed the questionnaire. The overall DREEM score for the study was 125.88/200, with a standard deviation of 58.79. SSP items received the highest scores, while SAP items earned the lowest scores. The college and the academic level showed statistically significant differences in the DREEM overall score and the five subscales, whereas gender showed no significant difference. The college of pharmacy scored the highest total DREEM score (140.35 ± 27.75), and scored higher among the five subscales than both colleges of dentistry (114.13 ± 29.74) and medicine (113.87 ± 33.03).

Correlating possible predisposing demographics and systemic conditions with the aortic root.,Fakoya AOJ; Otohinoyi DA; Omole AE; Oladele C; Kalejaiye A; Onuegbu A; Nwalie E; Talukdar D; Erinkitola O,"BACKGROUND: The aortic root is an aggregate of various components that connects the left ventricle to the aorta. The most predominant pathologies have been associated with the dilation of the aortic root leading to aneurysms. AIM: This study is designed to measure the role of systemic morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and body mass index (BMI) on the dimension of the aortic root. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were volunteers of African descent who were recruited during and after an organized health fair by the medical students' body from All Saints University, School of Medicine. 169 participants consisting of 62 males and 107 females with ages ranging from 9 to 84 years agreed to volunteer by signing the consent after which a questionnaire was administered and a preliminary clinical procedure was used to check for blood pressure (BP), blood glucose (BG), and BMI. The measurement of the aortic root was carried out by an experienced single investigator who was not aware of the purpose of measurements, using a DUS-5000 ultrasound machine (Miami, Florida, USA) at a low-frequency micro-convex transducer preset to ""adult cardiac"" with a default frequency of 4 MHz.

METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey, distributed via emergency medicine professional organizations, discussion boards, and listservs, to address study objectives. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 464 respondents; 56% were women. Most experienced childbirth while employed as an EP. Fifty-three percent of women and 60% of men reported working in a setting with a formal maternity leave policy; however, 36% of women and 18% of men reported dissatisfaction with these policies. Most reported that other group members cover maternity-related shift vacancies; a minority reported that pregnant partners work extra shifts prior to leave. Leave duration and compensation varied widely, ranging from no compensated leave (18%) to 12 or more weeks at 100% salary (7%). Supportive attitudes were reported during pregnancy (53%) and, to a lesser degree (43%), during leave. Policy improvement suggestions included the development of clear, formal policies; improving leave duration and compensation; adding paternity and adoption leave; providing support for physicians working extra to cover colleagues' leave; and addressing breastfeeding issues.

"Endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis in adulthood are strongly associated with anogenital distance, a biomarker for prenatal hormonal environment.",Mendiola J; Sánchez-Ferrer ML; Jiménez-Velázquez R; Cánovas-López L; Hernández-Peñalver AI; Corbalán-Biyang S; Carmona-Barnosi A; Prieto-Sánchez MT; Nieto A; Torres-Cantero AM,"STUDY QUESTION: Is the length of the anogenital distance (AGD), a biomarker of the in-utero prenatal hormonal environment, associated with the presence of endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Shorter AGD is associated with presence of endometriomas and DIE. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: It is debated whether hormonal exposure to estrogens in utero may be a risk factor for endometriosis in adulthood. AGD is a biomarker of prenatal hormonal environment and observational studies have shown an association between AGD and reproductive parameters in both sexes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This case-control study of 114 women with endometriosis (endometriomas and/or DIE) and 105 controls was conducted between September 2014 and May 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cases were attending the Endometriosis Unit of the Hospital. Prevalent as well as incident cases, diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), were included. Controls were women without endometriosis attending the gynecological outpatient clinic for routine gynecological exams. Participants completed health questionnaires, followed physical and gynecological examinations, including TVUS. Measurements from the anterior clitoral surface to the upper verge of the anus (AGDAC), and from the posterior fourchette to the upper verge of the anus (AGDAF) were obtained in all subjects. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the association between AGD measurements and presence of endometriomas and/or DIE while accounting for important confounders and covariates, including age, body mass index, vaginal delivery or episiotomy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: AGDAF was related to presence of endometriomas and/or DIE. For all cases of endometriosis (endometriomas and DIE), women in the lowest tertile of the AGDAF distribution, compared with the upper tertile, were 7.6-times (95% CI 2.8-21.0; P-trend < 0.001) more likely to have endometriosis. With regard to DIE, women with AGDAF below the median, compared with those with AGDAF above the median, were 41.6-times (95% CI 3.9-438; P-value = 0.002) more likely to have endometriosis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In case-control studies, information and selection bias has to be ruled out. Physicians conducting the measurement were blind to the status of the patients. Controls came from the same population as the cases. We adjusted for known and suspected confounders and covariates, but the possibility of residual confounding or chance findings should always be considered. As with all observational studies, causal inference is limited. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study suggests that endometriosis, especially the DIE, might have a prenatal origin that may be traced back to the hormonal milieu in which the fetus develops.

Germline Mutations for Novel Candidate Predisposition Genes in Sporadic Schwannomatosis.,Min BJ; Kang YK; Chung YG; Seo ME; Chang KB; Joo MW,"BACKGROUND: Schwannomatosis is a late-onset tumor predisposition syndrome associated with the development of many different types of malignancies. A relevant genetic mechanism can be explained by three mutational events. The first-hit mutation is a germline mutation, and the SMARCB1 mutation on chromosome 22 is the most well-known genetic abnormality in patients with schwannomatosis. LZTR1 is another major predisposing gene in 22q-related schwannomatosis that lacks SMARCB1 variants. Although these two variants account for the occurrence of most familiar schwannomatoses, the genetic causes of sporadic schwannomatosis for the most part remain unknown. Therefore, current molecular diagnostic criteria cannot completely explain the basis of this disease. The common genetic background between schwannomatosis and other related malignant tumors is also unclear. Moreover, it is not easy to explain various clinical manifestations by only two known mutations. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Are there important sequences outside the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 region on chromosome 22 that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition to sporadic schwannomatosis? Or are there alternative evolutionarily conserved loci that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition? (2) Is the age of disease onset associated to such genetic variants? METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review and prospective genetic study on patients with schwannomatosis who were treated surgically. The clinical criteria to diagnose schwannomatosis were as follows: (1) histologically proven nonvestibular schwannomas; (2) no evidence of vestibular schwannomas on 3-mm brain MRI. A total of 21 patients were treated between March 2006 and June 2015. Since nine patients did not visit the outpatient clinic during the recruitment period, we obtained blood samples from 12 patients with schwannomatosis for a genetic analysis. After two patients were excluded because of their family history of schwannomatosis, genetic analyses were finally performed on 10 patients. Then, those with NF2, SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variants were screened by whole exome sequencing. All 10 patients passed our screening strategy. There were eight men and two women, with a median (range) age of 43 years (24 to 66) at the time of diagnosis. To select candidate genes, common ethnic variants and frequent mutations in in-house exome sequencing data were removed to exclude the population-specific polymorphisms not found in other population and to generalize the findings. Frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site variants were deemed pathogenic. Missense variants were classified as potentially pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance, or benign using in silico (via computer simulation) prediction algorithms, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2), and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD). A variant was considered potentially pathogenic if two or more algorithms predicted the variant to be damaging and benign if none considered it damaging. Then, potentially pathogenic variants only in the genes associated with cancer-predisposition or DNA damage repair were classified as the pathogenic candidate variants of sporadic schwannomatosis. The predictions for pathogenic candidate variants were checked again on Clinical Interpretation of Genetic Variants (InterVar) based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines and validated against Mendelian clinically applicable pathogenicity scores (M-CAP scores). RESULTS: We detected 26 variants; 13 variants across 10 genes were predicted to be pathogenic and found in seven patients, two each in ARID1A, PTCH2, and NOTCH2 and one each in MSH6, ALPK2, MGMT, NOTCH1, CIC, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One frameshift deletion in PTCH2 met the criteria for pathogenic or likely pathogenic classification, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Six missense mutations were classified as possibly pathogenic variants based on M-CAP scores. Four predicted pathogenic missense variants were detected in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes. Three DDR genes were affected: ARID1A, MGMT, and MSH6. Among the nine predicted pathogenic mutations detected in known cancer-predisposing genes, one was a frameshift deletion and the others were missense mutations. Seven tumor suppressor genes were involved: PTCH2, ALPK2, CIC, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One patient with multiple pathogenic variants in two DDR genes, ARID1A and MSH6, received a schwannomatosis diagnosis at 33 years old. Each of the other patients who had single variants in the DDR gene received their diagnoses at 41 years of age. The age at diagnosis was 40 years or older in patients with variants in cancer-predisposing genes, except for one patient who had multiple variants in TSC2 and CDKN2A. The carrier of those variants received the diagnosis at 24 years old. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified first-hit candidate mutations predisposing patients to schwannomatosis that were not related to SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variations in a cohort of patients with sporadic schwannomatosis. Patients with sporadic schwannomatosis without SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genetic variation may have developed the disease because of genomic variants related to cancer initiation in areas other than chromosome 22. Seven of 10 patients had predicted pathogenic germline mutations in DDR and cancer predisposition genes. We detected multiple cancer-related mutations in each patient. The age at the time schwannomatosis was diagnosed might be associated with a combination of variants and characteristics of the genes containing the variants; however, we did not have enough patients to confirm this association. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The germline mutations identified in this study and the ideas related to the age of disease onset may provide potential candidate variants for future research on sporadic schwannomatosis and help to revise the current clinical and molecular diagnostic criteria. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed for these variants.",2020,Nov,Clin Orthop Relat Res,478,11,2442-2450,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000001239,32281771,#405,Min 2020,"",""
"The DREEM, part 1: measurement of the educational environment in an osteopathy teaching program.",Vaughan B; Carter A; Macfarlane C; Morrison T,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of the educational environment has become more common in health professional education programs. Information gained from these investigations can be used to implement and measure changes to the curricula, educational delivery and the physical environment. A number of questionnaires exist to measure the educational environment, and the most commonly utilised of these is the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM). METHODS: The DREEM was administered to students in all year levels of the osteopathy program at Victoria University (VU), Melbourne, Australia. Students also completed a demographic survey. Inferential and correlational statistics were employed to investigate the educational environment based on the scores obtained from the DREEM. RESULTS: A response rate of 90% was achieved. The mean total DREEM score was 135.37 (+/- 19.33) with the scores ranging from 72 to 179. Some subscales and items demonstrated differences for gender, clinical phase, age and whether the student was in receipt of a government allowance. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of areas in the program that are performing well, and some aspects that could be improved. Overall students rated the VU osteopathy program as more positive than negative. The information obtained in the present study has identified areas for improvement and will enable the program leaders to facilitate changes. It will also provide other educational institutions with data on which they can make comparisons with their own programs.",2014,May,BMC Med Educ,14,,99,,10.1186/1472-6920-14-99,24884931,#406,Vaughan 2014,"",""
Perception of patient safety culture among undergraduate dental students: a cross-sectional study.,Jeetendar; Iqbal M; Lone MA; Lone MM; Abbasi MS; Ahmed N; Shaikh MS,"OBJECTIVES: Although patient safety has received a lot of emphasis in medicine and nursing, data regarding patient safety perception in dentistry are limited, particularly among dental students. Given the increasing risk of safety hazards, curriculum developers need evidence to guide their implementation in undergraduate studies. This study aimed to determine patient safety culture among undergraduate dental students in Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among dental students (n = 281) of Sindh, Pakistan. The average positive response rate for each domain and frequency of each demographic variable were determined. The chi-square test was employed to compare the differences in perception between the various study groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Based on the demographic variables, most of our respondents were female (60.5%), final year (59.1%), and public college students (53%). The study found that more than 50% of participants had a positive perception of safety in areas of teamwork, job satisfaction, work conditions, and management support. However, for stress recognition and safety climate, around 49% students had a positive response. Among the demographic variables, significantly larger number of females (56.4%, p = 0.014) and third year students (59.2%, p = 0.025) disagreed that it was difficult to speak up if they felt a problem with patient care, compared to males 43 (38.7%) and final year students 71 (42.8%). CONCLUSION: Measuring patient safety culture in developing nations holds significant potential and can be implemented to inform safety initiatives. The data in our study show a significantly positive attitude towards safety culture among dental students.

The duration of embryo culture after mouse IVF differentially affects cardiovascular and metabolic health in male offspring.,Aljahdali A; Airina RKRI; Velazquez MA; Sheth B; Wallen K; Osmond C; Watkins AJ; Eckert JJ; Smyth NR; Fleming TP,"STUDY QUESTION: Do the long-term health outcomes following IVF differ depending upon the duration of embryo culture before transfer? SUMMARY ANSWER: Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that in male but not female offspring, adverse cardiovascular (CV) health was more likely with prolonged culture to the blastocyst stage, but metabolic dysfunction was more likely if embryo transfer (ET) occurred at the early cleavage stage. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ART associate with increased risk of adverse CV and metabolic health in offspring, and these findings have been confirmed in animal models in the absence of parental infertility issues. It is unclear which specific ART treatments may cause these risks. There is increasing use of blastocyst, versus cleavage-stage, transfer in clinical ART which does not appear to impair perinatal health of children born, but the longer-term health implications are unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Five mouse groups were generated comprising: (i) natural mating (NM)-naturally mated, non-superovulated and undisturbed gestation; (ii) IV-ET-2Cell-in-vivo derived two-cell embryos collected from superovulated mothers, with immediate ET to recipients; (iii) IVF-ET-2Cell-IVF generated embryos, from oocytes from superovulated mothers, cultured to the two-cell stage before ET to recipients; (iv) IV-ET-BL-in-vivo derived blastocysts collected from superovulated mothers, with immediate ET to recipients; (v) IVF-ET-BL-IVF generated embryos, from oocytes from superovulated mothers, cultured to the blastocyst stage before ET to recipients. Both male and female offspring were analysed for growth, CV and metabolic markers of health. There were 8-13 litters generated for each group for analyses; postnatal data were analysed by multilevel random effects regression to take account of between-mother and within-mother variation and litter size. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: C57/BL6 female mice (3-4 weeks old) were used for oocyte production; CBA males for sperm with human tubal fluid medium were used for IVF. Embryos were transferred (ET) to MF1 pseudo-pregnant recipients at the two-cell stage or cultured in synthetic oviductal medium enriched with potassium medium to the blastocyst stage before ET. Control in-vivo embryos from C57BL6 × CBA matings were collected and immediately transferred at the two-cell or blastocyst stage. Postnatal assays included growth rate up to 27 weeks; systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 9, 15 and 21 weeks; lung and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity at time of cull (27 weeks); glucose tolerance test (GTT; 27 weeks); basal glucose and insulin levels (27 weeks); and lipid accumulation in liver cryosections using Oil Red O imaging (27 weeks). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Blastocysts formed by IVF developed at a slower rate and comprised fewer cells that in-vivo generated blastocysts without culture (P < 0.05). Postnatal growth rate was increased in all four experimental treatments compared with NM group (P < 0.05). SBP, serum and lung ACE and heart/body weight were higher in IVF-ET-BL versus IVF-ET-2Cell males (P < 0.05) and higher than in other treatment groups, with SBP and lung ACE positively correlated (P < 0.05). Glucose handling (GTT AUC) was poorer and basal insulin levels were higher in IVF-ET-2Cell males than in IVF-ET-BL (P < 0.05) with the glucose:insulin ratio more negatively correlated with body weight in IVF-ET-2Cell males than in other groups. Liver/body weight and liver lipid droplet diameter and density in IVF-ET-2Cell males were higher than in IVF-ET-BL males (P < 0.05). IVF groups had poorer health characteristics than their in-vivo control groups, indicating that outcomes were not caused specifically by background techniques (superovulation, ET). No consistent health effects from duration of culture were identified in female offspring. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results from experimental animal models cannot be extrapolated to humans. Nevertheless, they are valuable to develop conceptual models, in this case, in the absence of confounding parental infertility, in assessing the safety of ART manipulations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The study indicates that longer duration of embryo culture after IVF up to blastocyst before ET leads to increased dysfunction of CV health in males compared with IVF and shorter cleavage-stage ET. However, the metabolic health of male offspring was poorer after shorter versus longer culture duration. This distinction indicates that the origin of CV and metabolic health phenotypes after ART may be different. The poorer metabolic health of males after cleavage-stage ET coincides with embryonic genome activation occurring at the time of ET.

A psychometric evaluation of the University of Auckland General Practice Report of Educational Environment: UAGREE.,Eggleton K; Goodyear-Smith F; Henning M; Jones R; Shulruf B,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop an instrument (University of Auckland General Practice Report of Educational Environment: UAGREE) with robust psychometric properties that measured the educational environment of undergraduate primary care. The questions were designed to incorporate measurements of the teaching of cultural competence. METHODS: Following a structured consensus process and an initial pilot, a list of 55 questions was developed. All Year 5 and 6 students completing a primary care attachment at Auckland University were invited to complete the questionnaire. The results were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis resulting in a 16-item instrument. RESULTS: Three factors were identified explaining 53% of the variance. The items' reliability within the factors were high (Learning: 0.894; Teaching: 0.871; Cultural competence: 0.857). Multiple groups analysis by gender; and separately across ethnic groups did not find significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: UAGREE is a specific instrument measuring the undergraduate primary care educational environment. Its questions fit within established theoretical educational environment frameworks and the incorporation of cultural competence questions reflects the importance of teaching cultural competence within medicine. The psychometric properties of UAGREE suggest that it is a reliable and valid measure of the primary care education environment.",2017,Mar,Educ Prim Care,28,2,86-93,,10.1080/14739879.2016.1268934,27990848,#409,Eggleton 2017,"",""
Perception Study of Traditional Korean Medical Students on the Medical Education Using the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure.,Kim H; Jeong H; Jeon P; Kim S; Park YB; Kang Y,"Background. In Korea, a few studies regarding traditional Korean medicine (TKM) education have been conducted. The aim of this study is to evaluate students' perceptions regarding TKM education in Korea and compare them with those of other countries using a quantitative scale, Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM). Materials and Methods. We conducted a survey using DREEM in a TKM college. Totally, 325 students responded to this survey and we performed the descriptive statistics of scores in all items, subscales, and total. Additionally, subgroup comparisons according to gender, school year, and academic achievement were analyzed. Results. Mean overall DREEM score was 94.65 out of 200, which is relatively low compared to previous studies. Particularly, perceptions regarding subscales of learning, atmosphere, and self-perceptions were interpreted as problematic. There was no statistically significant difference between genders in spite of some differences among groups based on school year or academic achievement. Conclusions. We could examine students' perceptions regarding TKM education at a TKM college using DREEM for which validity and reliability were verified. TKM education was perceived relatively poor, but these quantitative indicators suggested which parts of education need improvement. We expect DREEM to be used widely in TKM or traditional medical education field.",2016,,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,2016,,6042967,,10.1155/2016/6042967,28003851,#410,Kim 2016,"",""
The protein source in embryo culture media influences birthweight: a comparative study between G1 v5 and G1-PLUS v5.,Zhu J; Li M; Chen L; Liu P; Qiao J,"STUDY QUESTION: Does protein source or human serum albumin (HSA) in embryo culture media influence the subsequent birthweight? SUMMARY ANSWER: A significant difference was observed in gestational age- and gender-adjusted birthweight (Z scores) and the proportion of large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies between embryos cultured in G1 v5 and those cultured in G1-PLUS v5 media. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: It has been reported that the birthweights of singletons born from embryos cultured in Vitrolife are significantly higher than those cultured in the Cook group of media, and that G1-PLUS (Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden) is associated with increased birth and placenta weights compared with Medicult ISMI. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, AND DURATION: This study was a retrospective analysis of neonatal birthweights, and included 1097 singletons born from fresh embryo transfer cycles at the Center for Reproductive Medicine of Peking University Third Hospital between January 2011 and August 2012. The number of singletons born from G1 v5 culture media was 489, and the number of singletons born from G1-PLUS v5 media was 608. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS: Patients <40 years of age with a BMI <30 kg/m² were analysed. Only data from newborns from singleton pregnancies and born alive after the 28th week of gestation were included. Patients with a vanishing twin or with pregnancy-related complications, such as diabetes and hypertension, were excluded, as were patients who received preimplantation genetic diagnosis or used donor oocytes. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of individual factors on birthweights of singleton newborns. The birthweights and Z scores of singletons and LGA babies were compared between the G1 v5 and G1-PLUS v5 media groups. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The absolute birthweights for singletons resulting from G1-PLUS v5 were not different from singletons resulting from G1 v5 (3375.9 ± 479.6 g versus 3333.2 ± 491.6 g, respectively; P = 0.14). However the Z scores for singletons from embryos cultured in G1-PLUS v5 were significantly higher than for singletons cultured in G1 v5 (0.28 ± 1.12 versus 0.09 ± 1.15, respectively; P = 0.04), and more LGA babies were born from G1-PLUS v5 culture compared with G1 v5 (16.8 versus 12.1%, respectively; P = 0.03) culture. Finally, multiple linear regression analysis suggested that female weight (P = 0.00), male height (P = 0.04), gestational age at birth (P = 0.00), infant gender (P = 0.00) and culture media (P = 0.04) all had significant effects on the birthweights of singleton newborns. LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was limited by its retrospective design. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS: Our study suggests that protein source/HSA has a significant effect on birthweights of singleton newborns.

[Analysis of the onset time of acute aortic dissection and the influence of climate on acute aortic dissection occurrence in Urumqi city: a retrospective study of a single center].,Shi J; Yu Z; Ma Y; Yang L; Peng J; Ma X; Yang Y; Liu F,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the time characteristics of acute aortic dissection (AAD) in Urumqi and its peripheral areas in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and to explore the effect of meteorological conditions on the onset of AAD. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the related data of the adult AAD patients diagnosed by imaging examination, and admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from March 2010 to July 2016 was performed. The onset time, the contemporaneous meteorological data, including daily minimum, average, and the highest temperature, daily average air pressure, daily average relative humidity, daily precipitation, daily average wind speed, daily maximum wind speed, and sunshine duration per day were collected. Analysis of concentrated distribution trend of the AAD onset was done by circular distribution statistics. Meteorological conditions were compared between ""the AAD day"" and ""no AAD day"". The changes of air temperature 5 days before onset were observed. RESULTS: A total of 379 patients were enrolled, with 307 male and 72 female. The ratio of male to female was 4.19: 1, the average age was 52.27±12.18; and the underlying diseases was hypertension (about 58.05%); the incidence sites were Urumqi and Changji city. (1) The incidence of AAD in Urumqi and its peripheral areas had clear concentrated trend, and the peak period of AAD corresponded to January 1st to 2nd (homogeneity test r = 0.104, r (0.05) = 0.009, P < 0.05). (2) The minimum, mean and maximal atmospheric temperatures on ""the AAD day"" were lower than ""no AAD day"" [centigrade: 4.10 (-9.55, 14.60) vs. 7.75 (-6.70, 16.20), 14.10 (-1.50, 25.00) vs. 17.50 (0.60, 26.78), 8.50 (-6.22, 19.45) vs. 12.10 (-3.60, 20.90), all P < 0.05], sunshine duration was significantly shorter than ""no AAD day"" [hours: 8.50 (4.60, 10.70) vs. 8.90 (5.50, 11.50), P < 0.01], and atmospheric pressure were higher than ""no AAD day"" [kPa: 91.24 (90.66, 91.75) vs. 91.12 (90.62, 91.61), 19.11 (18.99, 19.22) vs. 19.09 (18.98, 19.19), both P < 0.05]; there were no significant differences in the incidence of daytime temperature difference, average relative humidity, precipitation, average wind speed, and maximum wind speed between the two groups. (3) the peak period of AAD occurrence was December (38 cases), which was followed by January (36 cases); and there were 26 cases of each month in May, June, July, and September, which were lower than the rest of months. It was shown by the temperature distribution that the minimum average temperature was in January (-12.46 centigrade), followed by December (-9.03 centigrade); the maximum average temperature was in July [(24.59±3.21)centigrade], followed by August [(23.14±3.64)centigrade]. (4) The patients was sorted according to the quartile of daily mean temperature, into < -5.2 centigrade, -5.2-10.7 centigrade, 10.7-20.4 centigrade, and > 20.4 centigrade groups, and each group had 104, 99, 98, 78 cases of AAD, respectively. The number of AAD in lowest temperature group was 1.33 times of the highest temperature group. In the 45-59 and 60-74 years, the number of AAD in lowest temperature group was higher than that in the highest temperature group (50 vs. 36, 26 vs. 13). In patients with hypertension, the number of AAD in lowest temperature group was higher than that in the highest temperature group (60 vs. 44). (5) The maximum air temperature, mean air temperature of the day from 5 days before to the onset day of AAD, and the lowest temperature from 3 days before to the onset day of AAD display slowly decrease trends, but there was no significant difference in daily temperature. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AAD in Urumqi and its peripheral areas was concentrated from January 1st to 2nd of each year. When the temperature was lower than -5.2 centigrade, AAD were more likely to attack. The 5 days changes of temperature and daily temperature before the attack were relevant with onset of AAD.

Women Empowerment in Medical Imaging and Radiology: Status and Challenges,Alruwaili A.R.S.; ; Alzahrani A.A.; Almater H.A.; Aldibas L.A.; Al anazi N.F.; Albanyan A.M.; Alyami W.,"Since the pandemic's beginning, there have been significant setbacks in social and economic inclusion of women. The resistance by public can be quite challenging too due to different reasons, such as religious beliefs or the dominance of custom and traditions creating a consistency in leadership perceptions and prototypes of leaders. The Saudi vision unleashed the exacerbated efforts to increase women involvement in the workforce and empower them in leadership roles. Yet the overall representation of women in leadership positions in health and academe in Saudi Arabia remains low compared to other countries. Exploring women status in medical imaging and the risks of reversals after the pandemic became necessary. An online questionnaire was distributed to female workers in both health and academic institutions in the field of medical imaging from December 31, 2021 to October 10, 2022. A total of 250 responses were received, and only 240 females consented and met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Results show that Saudi women still face the glass ceiling when it comes to administrative roles even though they have high level of self-esteem and efficacy along with the support from the Saudi government by fair wages compared to male counterparts. However, institutions imposed largely more constraints on women, creating difficult environment for gender diversity in work culture such as breastfeeding hour, rest during working hours, leave for accompanying family member in sickness or hospitalization such as children, sick leaves during pregnancy or monthly period. In a remarkably short span of time, the current Saudi government has undertaken commendable initiatives to empower women, achieving their predetermined targets with notable success. Despite that, there are many familial and cultural challenges that hinder them from leading positions. The perceived efficacy of women leaders and the disparities in their leadership philosophies are still up for research.<ovid:br/>Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

"Cultivating a ""Feminine"" Surgical Culture: Lessons from Indonesia",Sanders H.M.; ; Cullen C.M.; Benitez T.M.; Prasetyono T.; Chung K.C.,"BACKGROUND: Although the number of female physicians in the United States has been increasing, most practicing surgeons in the United States are men. By contrast, Indonesia has achieved notable gender parity among surgeons, with the number of women practicing as plastic surgeons projected to soon surpass that of men. Achieving greater female representation in plastic surgery is important for delivering high-quality care, especially in the face of physician shortages and high burnout rates. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This survey study was conducted at the 26th annual scientific meeting of the Indonesian Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, in Manado, Indonesia, in August 2023. Respondents were asked about their perceptions of plastic surgery, mentorship, career motivations, and caregiving responsibilities. Responses were scored using a 3-point Likert scale of agreement with statements (disagree, neutral, or agree); chi 2 and Fisher exact tests were performed to assess differences in responses by sex. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In this validated survey of 175 plastic surgeon trainees and attendings, there were no significant differences between sexes in the perception and roles of mentorship in preparing for a career in plastic surgery. Respondents from both sexes espoused optimistic views on work-life balance items, including time for family and friends and flexibility of work schedules. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Indonesia can serve as a model for encouraging greater gender parity in plastic surgery. Community-level interventions, such as family leave policies, childcare provisions, and initiatives to promote an inclusive culture, will create a more supportive workplace to increase women's representation in plastic surgery in the United States and around the world.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",2025,/,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,155,1,228eEP  - 237e,644225520,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000011520,38722578,#414,Sanders 2025,"",""
"THE INCLUSION OF SEX AND GENDER IN RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, FUNDING, AND PUBLICATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW",Green J.; ; Templeton K.; Bassett A.J.,"IMPORTANCE: Gender inequity in access to and outcomes of orthopaedic care demands research that properly analyses data based on sex and gender. Orthopaedic surgeons have an obligation to mitigate gender inequity in the provision of care by addressing the sex and gender bias in orthopaedic research methodology, grant funding, and publication demonstrated by this review.This study aimed to review the literature on known gender inequities in orthopaedic care, as well as sex and gender bias in orthopaedic research methodology, funding and publication; and to then to outline mitigating strategies. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for articles published in English between 2000 and 2024. The databases searched included MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane, and Scopus. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 70 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. Women often have poorer access to care and poorer outcomes than men for many common orthopaedic procedures. Sex-specific analysis reached a maximum of 34% for combined basic science, translational and clinical research in major orthopaedic journals. Women were less likely than men to be study participants. Orthopaedic outcome measures do not adequately account for the epidemiological factors that predominantly affect women including pregnancy and care of the (often extended) family or differences in factors such as pain and return to work or sport. The probability of sex-related reporting was higher in papers with women first and last authors, often in journals with lower impact factors.Women orthopaedic researchers received only 55.2% of the funding of men orthopaedic researchers. While women first authorship increased statistically significantly from 1995 to 2020 (6.70% to 15.37%, P< 0.001) manuscripts submitted by women were less likely to be published, and those with a woman first author demonstrated a lower citation rate. Mitigating strategies to address biases in research methodology and publication include adopting evidence-based Gender Specific Analysis (GSA) methods into the orthopaedic research process, considering GSA as a prerequisite for research grants and manuscript publication, increasing the diversity of orthopaedic editorial boards, and supporting the careers of women in the orthopaedic academic community through a more gender equitable environment and career-long mentorship and sponsorship. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: There are well-documented gender inequities in orthopaedic care. Addressing the identified sex and gender bias in orthopaedic research methodology, funding and publication is a public health imperative. Mitigating strategies include education and the integration of sex and gender analysis in each step of the research to publication pathway, and increasing women in academic orthopaedics through mentorship, sponsorship and more inclusive department culture and policies.

All-cause and cause-specific mortality inequalities between people with and without disability: a nationwide data linkage study in Australia,Yang Y.; ; Summers P.; Aitken Z.; Kavanagh A.; Disney G.,"Background: Without high-quality statistics on mortality inequalities, designing policies to improve the health of people with disability is challenging. We aim to quantify mortality inequalities experienced by people with disability in Australia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this nationwide, data linkage study we used Census mortality linked data (2011-20) to construct a cohort of Australians aged 0-74 years. Disability was measured as requiring assistance or supervision in core daily activities. We estimated age-standardised and age-specific mortality rates, and absolute and relative mortality inequalities between people with and without disability. <ovid:br/>Finding(s): 15 216 195 people were included in the study, comprising 7 763 047 females and 7 453 148 males. Of the participants, 258 109 (3.5%) males and 228 658 (2.9%) females reported disability, with 462 990 deaths occurring over 138 540 359 person-years of follow-up. Per 100 000 person-years, there were 2067 (95% CI 2043-2091) more deaths in males and 1697 (1677-1718) more deaths in females with disability (3.69 and 4.64 times higher, respectively) than those without disability. Cancer and cardiovascular disease had the highest absolute inequalities, with rate differences of 462 (95% CI 449-476) for males and 368 (356-379) for females for cancer, and 471 (95% CI 459-483) for males and 333 (324-342) for females for cardiovascular disease. Less common causes among people without disability-neurological conditions, chronic lung diseases, endocrine diseases, and digestive diseases-are relatively common among people with disability, translating to high relative mortality inequalities. The largest relative inequalities were from neurological conditions, with rate ratios of 9.66 (95% CI 9.31-10.02) for males and 11.61 (11.13-12.10) for females. Relative and absolute inequalities were also substantial for unintentional injury and for suicide mortality. Age-specific mortality was consistently higher in people with disability. The leading contributors to absolute inequalities shifted from neurological conditions in younger ages to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases in older ages. <ovid:br/>Interpretation(s): People with disability experience large mortality inequalities. Identifying intervention-amenable factors contributing to these inequalities should be a priority. Targeted interventions and policy reforms to create a more inclusive social and health-care environment for people with disability might be necessary. <ovid:br/>Funding(s): The University of Melbourne.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

It is important to empower and resource with protected time and budget a vice chair who can be active and intentional day in and day out to create, maintain (and hopefully expand) an inclusive community. Their work should be augmented with a committee inclusive of staff, faculty, and trainees who can provide feedback and creative ideas. Additional leaders might be needed to complement a vice chair, such as a director for gender equity. Vice chairs should be networked into larger communities of peers at a local and national level to share best practices and enhance their dissemination.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2024,/,Surgery (United States),,"(Sosa) Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA, United States",108936,2035903328,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2024.10.027,39580307,#418,Sosa 2024,"",""
Underrepresentation of International Medical Graduates in Academic Leadership in Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine,Wu Y.; ; Joshi S.,"Rationale: International medical graduates (IMGs) comprise around 25% of the healthcare workforce in the United States (US), filling a critical gap in the nation's healthcare delivery. In the specialty of pulmonary disease and critical care medicine (PCCM), these numbers are higher with IMGs, comprising 30-40% of the active workforce. Recent research has highlighted gender and minority gaps in academic leadership positions, but little is known about the representation of IMGs in leadership. In this observational study, we evaluate the representation of IMGs in PCCM fellowship leadership for the year 2023. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In August 2023, we conducted a search on the American Medical Association Residency & Fellowship Database (FREIDA) for Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine (IM) fellowships. Information about programs, categorized by geography and type (university-based or non-university-based, including community-based, military, or other), and program directors (PD) was extracted. PD data, including gender and degrees (American medical graduates (AMGs) or IMGs), were collected from hospital websites and online sources. We utilized Chi-squared analysis to evaluate associations, defining a significant p-value as <0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In August 2023, 202 PCCM programs were listed in FREIDA. Among PDs, 67% were AMGs (n=136) and 33% were IMGs (n=66). Females (34%, n=69) were outnumbered by male counterparts (66%, n=133). Female underrepresentation worsened further for IMG women (6.4%, n=13/202) compared to AMG women (27.7%, n=56/202) with statistical significance (p < 0.005). Among PDs of university-based programs (n=110), 76% were AMGs (n=84/110), of which 46% were women (n=39/84), and 24% were IMGs (n=26/110), of which 31% were women (n=8/26). Among PDs of non-university-based programs (n=92), 57% were AMGs (n=52/92), of which 33% were women (n=17/52), and 43% were IMGs (n=40/92), of which 13% were women (n=5/40). Notably, all program directors in New England were AMGs (100%). Males dominated as PDs in most regions, except in East South Central (60% female, n=6). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This observational study identifies underrepresentation of IMGs in PCCM fellowship leadership positions. This gap widens further in university-based programs. Some parts of the country have no IMGs in fellowship leadership. Concerningly, IMG women are even more underrepresented across the spectrum. Further research is necessary to assess the generalizability of these findings across various specialties and leadership levels. Efforts should focus on gaining insight into factors contributing to a lack of gender and minority parity and addressing societal norms, institutional policies, and biases in promotions, towards a more diverse and inclusive environment in academic leadership positions.",2024,/,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,209,"(Wu) Internal Medicine, MetroWest Medical Center, Framingham, MA, United States(Joshi) Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Duke University, School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States",,644441402,https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2024.209.1_meetingabstracts.a3332,,#419,Wu 2024,"",""
"Relevance at scale: Being global, feeling local",Nartker A.; ; Wall L.; Petracca F.; Hals M.; McGee A.; Downer A.,"Program/Project Purpose: E-learning is an inventive solution for responding to the growing need for trained health professionals in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) because it can provide on-going education without interrupting care delivery or incurring high costs. The Department of Global Health e- Learning Program (eDGH) at the University of Washington has offered eight online courses to more than 10,000 health professionals in 60 LMICs since 2013. We have learned that effective training of a global audience from various cultural, demographic, linguistic, and geographic backgrounds requires that online content be localized. To achieve this, eDGH uses a site-facilitator and peer group discussion model blended with online learning. This model increases the relevance of the material for students and allows content to be localized. Structure/Method/Design: The site-facilitator model relies upon volunteers to lead weekly in-person meetings for those studying the material online. Site-facilitators receive orientation via a synchronous broadcast before convening in-person sessions. These sessions enhance learning by allowing discussion in the local language and application of content to local examples. Outcome and Evaluation: eDGH measures learning from the online courses through weekly and online end-of-course evaluations. The online course, Leadership and Management in Health (LMIH), has been offered and evaluated for six years. Student responses indicate that localizing content using the site-facilitated model increases the relevance of the material for participants and increases motivation and social cohesion among group members. Local site groups help them solve workplace problems, allow them to converse in local languages, and apply content to their work settings by discussing concepts with others. Most participants (98%) in the 2014 evaluation reported that the course was culturally relevant and that on-site sessions aided their learning significantly. Going Forward: eDGH will compare completion rates and perceived cultural relevancy for site and non-site-facilitated courses to better understand the model. To encourage further localization, LMIH is piloting a ""Voices from the Field"" podcast where students record their stories to relate course concepts to challenges such as dealing with hierarchy, age and gender bias, and corruption in the workplace.",2016,/,Annals of Global Health,82,3,372EP  - 373,614044788,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2016.04.110,,#420,Nartker 2016,"",""

Expanding this study to different settings could provide insights for customized interventions. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and causes of stress experienced by radiography students across university settings in Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan, with particular attention to gender-based differences. By analyzing stress levels across these diverse academic environments, the study seeks to identify key stressors specific to each region, as well as any differences in stress impact related to gender, academic demands, and cultural contexts. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This cross-sectional study involved 608 radiography students from accredited programs in Egypt, UAE, and Jordan, selected through convenience and snowball sampling. A 96-question online survey, developed following CHERRIES guidelines, was distributed via university channels and social media. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS. The questionnaire's reliability was confirmed through a test-retest method, yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Out of 608 radiography students surveyed, stress levels differed by gender. Specifically, 11.7 % of students reported extremely high stress, with 5 % of males and 14.4 % of females. Gender disparities were evident that females experienced significantly higher stress than males in areas such as quality of education, exams, GPA, fear of mistakes, clinical factors, patient care, lack of relaxation time, and health problems (p < 0.001). In the UAE, 41.8 % of students believe a lack of time with family and friends significantly affects their stress, followed closely by 41.7 % in Egypt and 30.5 % in Jordan (p = 0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The study identifies gender-specific discrepancies in stress among university students, demonstrating that female students experience higher stress levels, influenced by factors such as academic standards, examinations, GPA, and work-life balance. Furthermore, students in Jordan and the UAE are facing academic workload stress, while Egyptian students deal with career uncertainty and family-related stress. Impact on practice: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding diverse stressors among radiography students to provide insights that can inform tailored support strategies to enhance the well-being and academic performance of radiography students in these regions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The College of Radiographers",2024,/,Radiography,,"(Ali, El-Sayed, Ahmed, Adnan, Rawashdeh) Faculty of Health Sciences, Gulf Medical University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates(Rawashdeh) Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan(El Safwany) Radiology and ",,2036566055,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2024.12.008,,#421,Ali 2024,"",""
Disparities in gender and race representation among authors of inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials,Gros B.; ; Peraza J.; Bassi M.; Sleiman J.; Abdelhalim S.; Park E.; Wong S.-Y.; Agrawal M.; Grinspan L.T.; Charabaty A.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Female physicians, particularly those from minority populations, are significantly underrepresented in research authorship in gastroenterology. This underrepresentation negatively impacts their career progression. This study analyses gender and race representation trends in published clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated factors. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): IBD clinical trials were identified from ClinicalTrials.gov and https://www.ibd-eii.com, spanning years 1955 to 2023. The variable gender was extracted for all authors and race was extracted for first, second, senior, corresponding authors and principal investigator (PI) using predictive tools and manual verification. Data on authorship, trial characteristics, and sponsorship were collected. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 438 clinical trials involving 5,517 authors were analysed. Females constituted 26.3% of authors, 17.1% of first authors, 6.1% senior authors and 24.2% of PIs, with non-white individuals representing 12.3% of first authors, 5.9% of senior authors and 18.8% of PIs. Female representation increased from 1971 to 2023 but remained substantially lower relative to male representation. Industry-sponsored trials had the lowest female author and PI representation while non-industry, single-center, paediatric, and advanced therapy trials had higher female representation. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study highlights persistent gender and racial disparities in IBD trial authorship and leadership despite some progress over the decades. Female and non-white individuals remain underrepresented, especially in industry-sponsored trials and in senior authorship roles. Systemic interventions are warranted to foster an inclusive and equitable research environment, including mentorship and support for underrepresented groups.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2024.

"Feedback For Fellows: Opening The Pandora's Box Of ""Confidence"" In Feedback",Ananthakrishnan S.; ; Noronha C.,"Background: Feedback is a key component of training at any level. Sub-specialty fellowship training has unique goals and barriers to feedback exchange, such as faculty tension with giving negative feedback to potential future colleagues, that are uncommon in other training environments. A common characteristic that may be discussed in feedback exchanges is a supervisor's perception of a trainee's confidence. Concerns have been raised both at the local and national level regarding the potential negative effects of the word ""confidence"" in medical education, due to cultural, gendered, and racial biases,which can be harmful to the learning environment in endocrinology where many traineeshail from diverse geographic and cultural backgrounds. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Within our institution,ACGME annual survey data between 2015-2019 indicated that a large portion of internal medicine specialty fellows were not satisfied with the feedback they received. Pilot data from a survey administered to trainees in the Department of Medicine at our institution indicated that 66.67% (n=31) of trainees had received feedback about their confidence level as observed in the clinical setting. Over 70% of those trainees felt the feedback was actionable less than half the time. The themes of frustration and ambiguity in interpreting the feedback around ""confidence"" emerged from the trainee data. To address perceived deficiencies in supervisor knowledge, skills and attitudes around fellowship-specific feedback exchange, we implemented departmental workshops focused on highlighting tools related to giving feedback to fellow trainees and case-based discussions to understand how and why the word ""confidence"" is used in feedback and how it may be interpreted by trainees. <ovid:br/>Result(s): This feedback workshop has been instituted within our Department of Medicine and was piloted with a focus on fellowship education in the Endocrinology section by the time of this abstract (further data forthcoming). Following the workshop, attendees (n=13) were surveyed. 76.9% of respondents had experience delivering feedback with the word or theme of ""confidence"", despite 69.2% of respondents being aware of the varied meanings of the word. Following the workshops, data from faculty attendees indicated 92% of respondents were aware of the varied meaning and 99% felt more comfortable using behavioral-based, as opposed to personality-based, language to support actionable changes in fellow skills. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This workshop curriculum suggests further need to explore the impact of the word ""confidence"" in feedback exchanges. Our pilot data is a call to action for further research on the development of effective strategies on how to move past use of the word ""confidence"" in feedback,with the goal of providing more specific, bias-free and behavioral-based feedback that can support a more inclusive learning environment for fellowship trainees.",2024,/,Journal of the Endocrine Society,8,Supplement 1,A542,645888768,https://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvae163.1045,,#423,Ananthakrishnan 2024,"",""
Lessons learned the hard way: Sharing experiences from female radiologists regarding gender inequality,Jessica C.; ; Mary W.; Pauline G.; Robyn G. R.,"Radiology remains a male-dominated specialty, with women facing unique challenges across both academic and private practice settings. Prior research has documented many of these obstacles, which we explored further through the perspectives of 25 female radiology attendings. They shared experiences on key issues such as gender bias, discrimination, sexual harassment, mentorship, pregnancy, and work-life balance. Recurring themes emerged around the need for a supportive workplace culture, strong advocacy, and camaraderie. While significant progress has been made, there remains considerable work ahead to overcome these challenges and foster a more inclusive environment for women in the field of Radiology. We hope that sharing these open and candid conversations will raise awareness about the pervasive gender inequality in radiology, and will help foster a more inclusive and supportive environment, and contribute to meaningful changes in the workplace, paving the way for future generations of female radiologists.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024",2025,/,Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology,54,1,40EP  - 44,2035911463,https://dx.doi.org/10.1067/j.cpradiol.2024.11.003,,#424,Jessica 2025,"",""

This study explores the extent of these disparities in Canadian academic internal medicine, particularly in academic ranks, leadership positions, and research productivity. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Cross-sectional. Subjects: Faculty physicians within internal medicine and subspecialties. Main Measures: Data on faculty physicians with Medical Doctorate (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), or Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees were compiled from 17 internal medicine programs listed in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). Research metrics were obtained using Elsevier's Scopus, and analyses were performed with Stata v14.2. Key Results: Among 5099 physician faculty members in internal medicine, 34% were women, and 66% were men. Among the faculty members holding leadership positions, 68% were men, and 32% were women. There was a significant difference in h-index between men and women physician faculty members (p <= 0.001), with men having a higher research output. Across all academic ranks, men faculty had higher median h-index values: Assistant Professor (12 vs. 9), Associate Professor (20 vs. 16), and Professor (40 vs. 30). Women were underrepresented in the procedural specialties, while only a few internal medicine subspecialties, such as palliative medicine and geriatrics, had a women predominance. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study underscores existing gender disparity within academic internal medicine in Canada, aligning with global trends.

Opinion & Special Article: Community Approach Toward Inclusion of Sex and Gender Diversity in Graduate Neurology Education,L'Erario Z.P.; ; Adams M.; Makara J.; Zeigler G.,"Sex and gender diverse (SGD) neurology trainees include transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people. There has been historical exclusion of SGD trainees from participating in clinical care, medical research, and academic training programs. Therefore, neurology educators have unique opportunities to support SGD trainees and colleagues, but may lack the education to appropriately do so. Training programs and professional organizations can collaborate to create safe pathways for SGD trainees to disclose their identities in professional settings. Referral to community support and resources is important for SGD trainees considering professional disclosure. Educators should address the challenges and discrimination unique to SGD graduate trainees in neurology, such as lack of inclusion, affirming environments, supportive policies, and medical accommodations. Faculty training on sensitivity, bias, and bystander effects should be ongoing among institutions. Topics regarding sex and gender diversity are lacking in graduate medical education. Educational curricula often use outdated terminology or binary paradigms to teach about sex and gender. Health care training inequities may cause downstream harm to SGD patients; therefore, training curricula that are reflective of an accurate and affirming understanding of sex and gender may mitigate the potential for inequities. This article provides recommendations to support SGD neurology trainees and to incorporate specific training on sex and gender diversity in academic neurology curricula. Such support is critical to the career success and development of SGD neurology trainees.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Academy of Neurology.",2024,/,Neurology,102,8,e209360,2035001295,https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209360,38513195,#426,L'Erario 2024,"",""
GENDER DISPARITIES IN CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH GRANT FUNDING FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH,Kaur H.; ; Ali M.; Fama A.; McEwen C.; Sidhom K.; Belley-Cote E.; Spence J.; Ofori S.; McIntyre W.,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of Canadian cardiologists identifying as women has increased from 9.2% in 1995 to 22.9% in 2019. However, women continue to be underrepresented in clinical and research leadership positions. Previous research has found that only 10% of lead authors in cardiovascular trials and 20% of recipients of federal cardiovascular grants in the United States identify as women. In Canada, funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is an important asset to further career advancement in academia. However, no studies have assessed gender disparities in Canadian grant funding for cardiovascular research. METHODS AND RESULTS: We extracted and analyzed publicly available cardiology grant data from the cardiovascular and randomized trials committees in the CIHR database between 2008 and 2023. Professional and regulatory websites were used to determine pronouns for gender and degrees while H index at the time of submission was elucidated using Web of Science. During this period, 777 funded grants had men as principal applicants (78.2%) and 217 had women (21.8%). Temporally, 80.4% of the funded principal applicants were men and 19.2% women in 2008-2013, 78.3% men and 21.7% women in 2013-2018, and 74.0% men and 26.0% women in 2018-2023. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of women receiving grants over time (p = 0.03). Among principal applicants, men who received funding received higher amounts than women (median: $594 105 (IQR: $240 371 - 758 085) versus $450 288 ($100 000 - 707 625) (p = 0.0001)). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that compared to men, women received $112 149 (p = 0.01) less per grant after controlling for confounding variables including province, H-index during the grant year, graduate degree, and year of funding. In regression analysis, the amount of grant funding increased by approximately $17,910 per year for men while it decreased by approximately $14,362 per year for women, holding all other variables constant. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): From 2008 to 2023, men consistently received higher funding amounts compared to women, despite an increase in the proportion of women receiving funding over time and even after adjusting for relevant factors.

Gender Disparities in Surgical Subspecialties: A CMS Data Analysis,Boutros C.S.; ; Bassiri A.; Jiang B.; Sinopoli J.; Tapias L.; Linden P.A.; Towe C.W.,"Introduction: The persistent under-representation of women in surgery remains a critical concern within the medical profession, prompting a need for a nuanced analysis of gender distribution. Despite advancements in medical education, historical gender disparities in surgery persist, necessitating an exploration of the specific realms where gaps are most pronounced. Leveraging the 2023 Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services National Downloadable Database, this study aims to contribute insights into the multifaceted dynamics of gender representation within surgical disciplines. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data from 1,168,064 physicians in the 2023 Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services National Downloadable Database were analyzed to distinguish between surgeons and physicians in medicine subspecialties. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression explored demographic variables, practice settings, and temporal trends to comprehensively understand factors contributing to the observed gender gap. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The analysis revealed a statistically significant gender difference, with only 16.7% of surgeons identified as female. Temporal trends indicated a slow increase in female surgeon representation, and specialty-specific analysis unveiled variations, such as lower likelihoods of females in cardiac surgery and higher likelihoods in colorectal surgery. Multivariable logistic regression emphasized factors influencing the odds of physicians practicing surgery, with female physicians exhibiting a lower likelihood. Regional and graduation year variations also played roles in surgical practice. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study provides evidence-based insights into the persistent gender gap within surgical specialties, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to enhance inclusivity and equity in the surgical workforce.

Will they always be living the Sisyphus punishment? The triple whammy for racialized women: a qualitative investigation of primary care researchers in Canada,Aggarwal M.; ; Wong S.T.,"Background: Existing literature overlooks the role of gender and race on research productivity, particularly in the context of primary care research. This study examines how gender and race influence the research productivity of primary care researchers in Canada, addressing a gap in existing literature. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Qualitative, descriptive methods were used, involving 60-min interviews with 23 Canadian primary care researchers. 13 participants were female (57%) and 10 participants (43%) were male. Fourteen participants were White (non-racialized; 61%), 8 were racialized (35%) and 1 did not comment on race (4%). Reflexive thematic analysis captured participant perceptions of factors influencing research productivity, including individual, professional, institutional, and systemic aspects. <ovid:br/>Finding(s): Systemic bias and institutional culture, including racism, sexism, and unconscious biases against racialized women, emerge as key barriers to research productivity. The parenting life stage further compounds these biases. Barriers include lack of representation in faculty roles, toxic work environments, research productivity metrics, and exclusion by colleagues. Participants indicated that institutional reforms and systemic interventions are needed to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. Strategies include recruiting equity-focused leaders, increasing representation of racialized female faculty, diversity training, mentorship programs, providing meaningful support, flexible work arrangements, and protected research time. Sponsors can offer more targeted grants for female and racialized researchers.

"Midwifery Students' Experiences of Bias in the Clinical Setting: Prevalence, Types, and Impact",Loomis H.; ; Hackley B.; Alexander-Delpech P.; McGahey E.; Perlman D.,"Introduction: Exposure to bias in clinical learning environments may undermine students' confidence, cause emotional harm, impede learning, and potentially delay graduation. However, little is known about the prevalence of bias experienced by midwifery students in the United States. This cross-sectional, descriptive study aimed to quantify clinical midwifery students' experiences of bias based on 7 self-identified characteristics (gender identity, race or ethnicity, body size, age, sexual orientation, religion, and occupational background). Additionally, this research explored the impact of bias on student well-being, learning, and professional commitment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The survey consisted of 39 items addressing (1) prevalence and types of bias, (2) emotional impact and influence on clinical learning, (3) ways students coped, (4) whether anyone spoke up at the time bias occurred, (5) whether students reported bias to faculty, and (6) impact of bias on commitment to midwifery. The survey was distributed to midwifery students and recent graduates in 2022 via American College of Nurse-Midwives email discussion lists and social media. Participants were eligible if they were in a clinical rotation in an Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education-accredited midwifery program between 2019 and 2022. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Surveys were returned by 383 participants, with 301 meeting inclusion criteria. Most participants (66.5%) reported personally experiencing or witnessing bias against at least 1 of 7 personal characteristics. The most commonly reported biases were related to gender, occupational background, age, and race or ethnicity. Only half of the participants reported these occurrences to someone with academic authority, and nearly a third considered withdrawing from their educational programs. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): In this study bias was common and significantly impacted students. These results underscore the need for creative and bold interventions at personal, educational, and institutional levels to prevent and mitigate bias. Safeguarding clinical learning environments will enable students to thrive, graduate with confidence and competence, and thereby contribute to the diversification and strengthening of the midwifery profession.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

EMINENCE AWARDS IN RHEUMATOLOGY: A GENDER EQUITY ANALYSIS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY DATA,Roy D.; ; Andreoli L.; Ovseiko P.V.; Dzifa D.; Ravindran Y.; Arredondo-Gonzalez A.M.; Singla S.; Toro-Gutierrez C.E.; Gupta L.,"Background: Gender equity refers to the fair and impartial treatment of individuals, irrespective of their gender. While the workforce in the health sector is predominantly female, previously published data highlight a low female representation in leadership positions within rheumatology, editorial boards of specialized journals, and lower academic productivity related to publications. Awards serve important functions in recognizing exemplary individuals who uphold the values and objectives cherished by award-granting institutions. In the field of rheumatology, scientific associations employ awards to highlight the trailblazing work of members, rendering it more visible. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This descriptive analysis aims to assess gender equity in eminence awards based on available data from the leading regional rheumatology societies worldwide. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A gender equity analysis of eminence awards was conducted using available online data from international society registries: the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), the Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), the Pan-American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR), and the African League of Associations for Rheumatology (AFLAR), spanning from 1988 to 2023. An analysis was conducted for each continent separately, and the data were examined by decades to assess the trend of awards in terms of the percentage of men and women receiving these recognitions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Out of 1,042 total awardees, 864 were male (82.91%) compared to 178 female recipients (17.08%), revealing significant gender imbalance. Analyzing gender parity across continents, Europe exhibited relatively better representation, with 31.03% of female award recipients (18 out of 58). In comparison, the proportions in other regions were 14.28% (5 out of 35) in the Asia-Pacific, 16.03% (152 out of 908) in North, Central, and South America, and 30% (3 out of 10) in Africa. A decade-long analysis was to examine the temporal evolution of gender disparity trends indicated a discernible trend in narrowing gender gap (i.e., 12.5% pre-1990, 16.66% in 1991-2000, 21.5% in 2001-2010, 20% in 2011- 2020, and 36.17% from 2021 onwards) (Figure 1). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The noteworthy disparity in the recognition of female rheumatologists with awards emphasizes the need for prompt action to address and rectify this imbalance. It is imperative to concentrate on organizational strategies aimed at promoting gender equity in acknowledging excellence within the field. The precise root cause of this inequity remains unclear, but it is likely influenced by a combination of factors such as gender bias, an unfavorable climate, unconscious discrimination, and a limited presence of senior female role models.

Investigation of gender-based needs in academic otolaryngology,Yalamanchi P.; ; Dombrowski J.; Pynnonen M.A.; Malloy K.M.; Prince M.E.; Kupfer R.A.,"Objective: Gaps in gender-based equity persist in academic otolaryngology. Here we present a needs-based assessment of otolaryngology faculty and trainees regarding facilitators and barriers to professional satisfaction and career development in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A qualitative study of otolaryngology faculty, trainees, and administrators who identify as women at an academic tertiary care center was performed from 2020 to 2021 using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Five confidential, virtual focus group sessions moderated by a third-party executive coach were audio-taped, transcribed, and reviewed for thematic content. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 48 women invited, 77% participated (18 faculty/administrative leaders, 10 residents/fellows, 4 audiologists). Participants noted direct patient care, support from colleagues who identify as women, and the transition to virtual meetings as facilitators of current professional satisfaction. Five themes emerged as barriers to workplace satisfaction and career development including (1) limited professional schedule flexibility, (2) competing commitments such as childcare exacerbated by pandemic, (3) lack of visible departmental leadership who identify as women, (4) perceived lack of organic sponsorship within subspecialty divisions, and (5) frequent identity-associated microaggressions from patients and staff outside the department. Strategies identified for improving gender-based equity included (1) promoting department-wide awareness of workplace gender-based differences, (2) implicit bias training within established programming such as grand rounds conferences, and (3) novel faculty programming such as leadership development training and formal junior faculty mentorship. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Confidential needs-based assessment of otolaryngology faculty and trainees identified both persistent gaps and strategies to enhance recruitment, support career development, and grow professional satisfaction of women within academic otolaryngology. <ovid:br/>Level of Evidence: 3.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

The urgency of restructuring the landscape of behavioral medicine: Commentary from early-career diversity institute scholars,Fowler L.A.; ; Quinones-Cordero M.M.; Sidani J.E.; Bernhart J.A.; Mendoza-Vasconez A.S.; Bannon S.M.; Unni E.J.,"Structural and systemic barriers entrenched in academia have sustained for decades, and resulted in a lack of diversity in leadership positions, inequitable workloads for women and underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and increasing issues with retention of faculty, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in higher education via legislation, policies, and general anti-DEI sentiment contextualizes the importance of prioritizing DEI.The goal of this commentary is to open discussion among academic institutions regarding changes in DEI culture that will facilitate the growth of diverse early-career faculty (ECF). We use an adapted framework which incorporates DEI into a faculty competency model to (i) guide our discussion of the rationale for restructuring academic systems to promote DEI and (ii) recommend strategies for institutional progress for ECF that can translate across academic institutions. Implementing policies and practices that seek to recruit, retain, and support historically underrepresented ECF are needed, and may involve faculty mentorship programs, establishing equitable funding mechanisms, reforming faculty evaluation practices, and examining and correcting inequities in faculty workloads. The onus is on institutions to recognize and replace the exclusionary practices and biases that have existed within their walls, and continuously promote and monitor their DEI efforts and initiatives to ensure their efficacy. Inclusive academic cultures that demonstrate their value of diversity and commitment to equity promotion at all levels of the organization, including among ECF, are necessary for ensuring excellence in scholarship in academia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Oxford University Press.

The sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) medical trainee: the journey through medical education,Danckers M.; ; Nusynowitz J.; Jamneshan L.; Shalmiyev R.; Diaz R.; Radix A.E.,"In this literature overview, we share with the reader challenges faced by LGBTQ + individuals pursuing medical education, from undergraduate to postgraduate training. The LGBTQ + acronym has evolved to encompass the diverse spectrum of sexual orientation and gender identities. Recently, the term ""Sexual and Gender Minority"" (SGM) has emerged as an umbrella term to provide consistency in research advancing SGM health. The unique obstacles LGBTQ + trainees encounter are highlighted throughout this article, including external factors influencing career decisions, a lack of LGBTQ + healthcare curricula, discriminatory social interactions, limited mentorship opportunities, and a higher mental health burden. These challenges have the capacity to affect educational experiences, personal well-being, and professional growth. Additionally, we examine the impact of inclusive institutional climates on LGBTQ + trainees' selection of medical schools and residency programs, as they may prioritize inclusiveness and diversity when making their choice. In postgraduate training, LGBTQ + trainees continue to face challenges, exemplified by disparities in placement rates and discriminatory experiences based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We describe the gap in current research and its long-term impact of these challenges on career paths. Hostile environments persist in certain specialties, and the lack of LGBTQ + mentorship and support can hinder academic pursuits. We shed light on the unique and pervasive challenges faced by LGBTQ + trainees throughout their medical education journey, while emphasizing the need for inclusive policies, support systems, and research to address these challenges. With increasing research and studies, we hope to create a medical workforce and community that better represents the diverse communities it serves.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

An electronic survey was distributed via email. Deidentified qualitative responses were coded by two independent researchers into themes. Themes characterize barriers that female head and neck (HN) surgeons face and describe ways to mitigate the impact of these for the next generation. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Contact information for 73/131 female AHNS speakers was obtained via internet search. Email responses were received from 22/73 (30%). Of those, respondents specialized in otolaryngology (n = 17), medical oncology (n = 2), palliative care (n = 1), vascular surgery (n = 1), and thoracic surgical oncology (n = 1). All speakers worked in academic settings at varying stages of their career with 81.8% (18/22) of respondents fellowship-trained (primarily HN surgery). Concerns about gender disparity in ENT were grouped into the following themes: (1) recruiting women to ENT, (2) removing barriers to career advancement, (3) diversifying ENT's national presence, and (4) improving the broader culture of HN surgery. Respondents emphasized a need for diversifying leadership, early exposure to otolaryngology in medical school, and connecting students with female role models. Outstanding research, involvement at annual meetings, and committee membership were consistently deemed important for establishing a national presence in the field. Implicit bias, ""boys clubs"" culture, and burdensome childcare responsibilities were described as barriers to career advancement. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While encouraging more women to enter otolaryngology residencies, increasing the number female role models and establishing strong mentoring networks may help to mitigate challenges. Meaningful progress requires the efforts of both male and female allies within the specialty. Simple solutions, such as educating on implicit bias, removing demographics from applications, and eliminating hidden penalties for maternity leave, may help improve diversity and mitigate barriers to career progression for underrepresented groups within ENT.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

Discrimination and dental students: What is the reality in Brazilian institutions?,Sartori L.R.M.; ; Henzel L.T.; Chisini L.A.; de Oliveira L.J.C.; Saboia V.P.A.; Correa M.B.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate whether there is discrimination in the dental educational environment, assess the main reasons for the discriminatory events, and if there is an association between discriminatory episodes and sociodemographic characteristics of undergraduate dental students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire to students enrolled in three Brazilian dental schools. Questions included sociodemographic characteristics and the occurrence of discriminatory episodes in the dental academic environment. Descriptive analysis was performed in RStudio 1.3 (R Core Team, RStudio, Inc., Boston, USA) software and the associations were tested using Pearson's chi-square test, considering 95% confidence intervals. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 732 dental students were included, with a response rate of 70.2%. The vast majority of students were female (66.9%), with white/yellow skin colour (67.9%), and with a mean age of 22.6 (SD 4.1) years. Sixth-eight percent of students reported having experienced some discrimination in the academic environment and most reported feeling uncomfortable with the episode. The main reasons to have been discriminated against raised by students were specific behaviour/habit, have specific moral, ethical, and aesthetic values, gender, and socioeconomic status or social class. The occurrence of discriminatory episodes was associated with female gender (p = .05), non-heterosexual sexual orientation (p < .001), studying in public institutions (p < .001), receiving an institutional scholarship (p = .018), and being in the final undergraduate cycle (p < .001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The occurrence of discriminatory episodes was common in Brazilian dental higher education.

What Are the Trends in Women's Representation Among Lead Investigators of Orthopaedic Clinical Trials?,Burkhart R.J.; ; Karimi A.H.; Hecht C.J.; Avila A.; Acuna A.J.; Kamath A.F.,"Background Serving as a principal investigator for a clinical trial can bring national visibility and recognition to physicians, and it can have a substantial impact on their promotion and tenure. In the field of orthopaedics, there is a well-known gender gap in terms of representation and leadership. Examining the representation of women in clinical trial leadership may help to inform and enable the design of targeted interventions and policies to foster a more inclusive and diverse environment in clinical trial leadership. Questions/purposes (1) What is the proportion of women principal investigators in orthopaedic clinical trials, and has this changed over time? (2) Are there trial characteristics (trial phase, status, funding source, and intervention) associated with women principal investigators? (3) What is the geographic distribution globally and regionally within the United States of clinical trials led by women principal investigators? Methods A cross-sectional survey of clinical trials using the ClinialTrials.gov registry and results database provided by the NIH was performed on August 22, 2022. Trial characteristics included principal investigator names and gender, trial phase, type, funding source, intervention, and location (defined by continent and US Census region). Our primary outcome was the overall proportion of women orthopaedic principal investigators over time. We assessed this by comparing the proportion of women principal investigators from 2007 to 2022. Our secondary outcomes were trial characteristics (trial phase, status, funding source, and intervention) and geographic distribution (globally and within the United States) associated with women principal investigators. Baseline characteristics of the clinical trials were calculated using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Fisher exact tests were conducted to evaluate differences in gender proportions based on the included clinical trial characteristics. Univariate linear regression was applied to analyze trends in the annual proportion of women principal investigators over time. Results The overall proportion of women principal investigators was 18% (592 of 3246), and this proportion increased over the study period. Specifically, the proportion of women leading clinical trials was 13% (16 of 121) in 2007 and 22% (53 of 242) in 2022 (r<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.68; p < 0.001). This trend was also observed when evaluating only US women principal investigators (r<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.47; p = 0.003) and non-US women principal investigators over the study period (r<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0.298; p = 0.03). There was no difference in the distribution of trial phases between men and women principal investigators. Most men and women were involved in ""not applicable"" or Phase IV trials. Similarly, there was no difference in trial status or funding source. However, women principal investigators had a higher proportion of studies involving behavioral interventions (11% [67 of 592]) compared with men principal investigators (3% [74 of 2654]; p = 0.03). The proportion of women principal investigators over the study period by world region revealed a higher proportion of women principal investigators in Asia (23% [88 of 391]), followed by South America (24% [12 of 49]), North America (18% [306 of 1746]), and Europe (16% [136 of 833]). Among all US trials over the study period, the proportion of women principal investigators across the US Census region was Northeast (19% [62 of 329]), South (18% [90 of 488]), West (20% [97 of 492]), and Midwest (13% [22 of 168]). Conclusion Although there has been a notable increase in the proportion of women principal investigators over time, the overall representation remains relatively low. The disparities observed in trial characteristics and geographic distribution of women principal investigators further emphasize the need for targeted interventions and policies to foster a more inclusive and diverse environment in clinical trial leadership. Clinical Relevance These results underscore the importance of adopting practices and strategies that foster gender equity in the leadership of orthopaedic clinical trials. By establishing mentorship and sponsorship programs, early-career women surgeons can be connected with experienced leaders, cultivating a supportive network and offering valuable career guidance. Additionally, addressing geographic disparities in the representation of women principal investigators can involve the implementation of mentorship and sponsorship programs in regions with lower representation.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 by the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.",2024,/,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,482,1,35EP  - 44,2029245998,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CORR.0000000000002769,37493365,#443,Burkhart 2024,"",""
Assessment of Gender Bias of Emergency Medicine Resident Physicians,Johnkutty N.; ; Setari A.; Rouff A.; Knieriem C.; Eneh C.; Espinosa C.; Neyman G.,"Background: The perception of female physicians in Emergency Medicine plays a crucial role in shaping the opportunities in a demanding medical specialty. Studies show female residents experience lack of mentorship and difficulties in establishing credibility. Initiatives have developed across residencies to promote diversity and we question whether they have been successful at implementing change. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to assess the perception of gender bias within the emergency department, with an emphasis on female resident physicians. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A structured online, anonymous survey distributed to residents, advanced providers, and attending physicians involved in a 3-year emergency medicine program. They were asked to rate statements on a scale from 1-7 (1 is a strong disagreement and 7 is a strong agreement). <ovid:br/>Result(s): were tabulated with counts, medians, IQRs, Mann Whitney U testing. Results Data from 48 participants, 50% identified as each gender and 56.3% are residents. The following questions were statistically significant in difference (p values 0.05-0.00007). Females were perceived more professional in behavior than men, men within the department can be patronizing to females (p=.001) and females opinions are overshadowed by males (p =.0009). Females felt coworkers perceived them as weaker members (p=.003) and males were seen as the leader in high stress situations ( p=.00007). Females reported confidence was affected by how peers perceived them (p=.007), more gender bias (p=.001) and pushback from nursing (p=.003). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite the emphasis on creating an inclusive environment, providers in emergency medicine still hold mixed perceptions of female emergency medicine physicians and data suggests female gender bias is present and may be a potential threat to female education.

EMPOWERING WOMEN IN HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP: UNVEILING BARRIERS AND STRATEGIES FOR ADVANCEMENT - A NARRATIVE REVIEW,O'Riordan M.; ,"Introduction The issue of underrepresentation of women in medical leadership roles, particularly in their retention and long-term engagement, is a pressing challenge in healthcare. Despite advancements in women's initial entry into these roles, their sustained presence and advancement in leadership roles have been relatively underexplored. This narrative literature review aims to addresses this significant gap, focusing on the retention of women in medical leadership. The review aims to uncover the factors that influence their long-term commitment and progression in these roles. Understanding these challenges is essential for fostering a diverse and inclusive leadership culture in healthcare, which is vital for meeting the varied needs of patients and enhancing organisational effectiveness. This review endeavours to provide insights into the retention strategies that can support the continuous growth and presence of female leaders in healthcare. Aims and objectives of the research project or activity This narrative review primarily aims to investigate the factors affecting the retention of women in medical leadership positions, an area that has received less attention in research compared to their initial recruitment into such roles. Specific objectives include: 1) To assess the extent of female underrepresentation in medical leadership across various healthcare systems; 2) To identify and analyse the key factors contributing to this gender disparity, encompassing policy, organisational culture, and individual- level challenges; 3) Evaluating the effectiveness of strategies and interventions designed to enhance this retention and ongoing engagement of women in these positions. Through addressing these objectives, this review seeks to fill a critical gap in the literature and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of gender inclusivity in medical leadership. Method or approach This narrative review employs an exploratory and interpretative methodology, focusing on the theme of women's retention in medical leadership roles. The search encompasses key academic databases including PubMed, MEDLINE( Ovid) and Scopus, alongside grey literature and reports from healthcare organisations, ensuring a broad spectrum of viewpoints. A narrative review approach allows for the inclusion of a diverse range of studies. The selection criteria were designed to prioritise studies and articles that directly address the unique challenges and solutions associated with retaining women in medical leadership positions. The search was narrowed to articles published between 2003 and 2023 in order to capture current workforce trends, whilst maintaining a comprehensive review. A total of 193 materials were initially identified to be potentially relevant for the review. A total of 19 articles were found to match the inclusion criteria and were subsequently reviewed. Findings The findings from this narrative review underscore that the retention of women in medical leadership roles is influenced by a complex range of factors. Structural barriers, such as limited progression opportunities beyond initial leadership roles and insufficient retention-focused policies are significant. Culturally, deeply ingrained gender stereotypes and biases within professional environments create formidable challenges. On a personal level, balancing professional growth with personal life commitments emerges as a pivotal issue. This review highlights various promising strategies for mitigating these challenges, including leadership development programs tailored for retention, ongoing mentorship and sponsorship initiatives, as well as organisational policy reforms aimed at supporting the long-term engagement of female leaders. However, there is a notable gap in rigorous, long-term evaluations of these strategies, pointing to the need for more comprehensive research into their effectiveness. These findings suggest that a multifaceted approach, distinct from strategies that solely focus on entry-level barriers, is essential for retaining women in leadership positions within the medical field. Key messages The central message of this review is the vital need for a strategic emphasis on the retention of women in medical leadership roles, a crucial yet underemphasised aspect of fostering inclusive healthcare leadership. This review advocates for the development and implementation of targeted strategies and policies specifically geared towards supporting the long-term engagement and career progression of women in such roles. Recommendations include specialised leadership training programs, continuous mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, along with organisational policies that foster work-life balance and career sustainability. By highlighting the advantages of a diverse and inclusive leadership, this review urges healthcare institutions and policy- makers to actively confront the unique challenges associated with retaining women in medical leadership positions. Such focused efforts are essential not only for achieving gender equity in leadership but also for enhancing healthcare delivery through a leadership structure that truly reflects the diversity of our medical workforce and patient population.",2024,/,BMJ Leader,8,Supplement 1,A53EP  - A54,644491511,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/leader-2024-FMLM.71,,#448,O'Riordan 2024,"",""
Disagreement in the ICU: An Institutional Analysis of Factors Leading to Resident and Nursing Conflict,Raif K.; ; Gosden G.; Ryden A.; Bowles A.; Keenan L.M.,"Rationale: A Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) serves as a multifaceted work environment comprising professionals from diverse fields with varying levels of experience. Consequently, conflict can easily emerge. We had previously worked on enhancing communication within the MICU; post-survey data exposed ongoing deficits related to disagreements in decision-making and concerns among residents regarding treatment disparities linked to gender. Data also revealed a lack of confidence among nursing staff in residents' decision-making capabilities, while residents reported feeling undervalued in their roles. In response, we conducted a needs assessment to delineate common areas of disagreement. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Two separate surveys were conducted: one for nursing staff and one for residents. Both surveys identified years of experience, gender, familiarity of nursing/resident names and occurrence of disagreement in patient care. The specific aspects of disagreement studied were pain management, sedation, ventilation setting, advanced line placement, vasopressors, foley catheters and chest tubes. Frequency of disagreement was rated on a Likert scale of 0 to 5. The nursing survey also evaluated if conflict was elevated beyond resident, and their impression of resident clinical decision-making capacity. The resident specific survey evaluated if they felt pressured to elevate the concerns of nursing staff to a supervising physician and if gender played a role in interactions with nursing. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We received responses from 11 residents and 12 nurses. Within the nursing survey the most reported disagreements were related to management of advanced line placement, pain and vasopressors with up to 60% of nursing staff reporting regular conflict in these areas. 100% of nursing staff reported practice differences between MICU and SICU as a source of conflict and 80% reported issues with resident experience. In the resident survey, 45% reported some conflict with pain management but only 27% reported conflicts over lines. 45% also reported conflict related to lack of respect for their experience. For barriers, 54% reported communication issues as a continued issue. Residents reported concerns of discrimination based on gender with half the responders reporting gender played a role in their nursing interactions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings illuminate differences in what nursing perceive as sources of conflict as compared to what residents report. This suggests continued barriers in communication along with unexplored differences in medical practice. Moreover, we found concerns from residents regarding potential gender-based discrimination. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at enhancing communication and fostering a more equitable and collaborative environment within our institution.",2024,/,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,209,"(Raif, Gosden, Ryden) University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States(Bowles) University of Utah, Salt lake city, UT, United States(Keenan) Pulmonary/Critical Care, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States",,644437483,,,#449,Raif 2024,"",""
IMPLEMENTATION OF UPSTANDER TRAINING CURRICULUM IN GASTROENTEROLOGY FELLOWSHIP,Voth E.; ; Gala K.; Simonetto D.; Wang X.J.,"Background: The field of medicine has demonstrated growing acknowledgement and increased awareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Despite these efforts, women and underrepresented minorities (URM) in medicine still face frequent challenges in the form of microaggressions. Upstander training- how to recognize and respond to microaggressions and bias in support of the victim- is underutilized in graduate medical education as part of a Equity, Inclusivity, and Diversity (EID) curriculum. We implemented Upstander Training in our gastroenterology (GI) fellowship as part of a core curriculum conference, with a case-based approach and open discussion on shared experiences. The aim of this educational initiative is to develop an interactive curriculum relevant to physician trainees in an effort to promote a flourishing and diverse physician work force. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a didactic session for all fellows in our general and 4<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> year GI fellowship programs. We specifically geared our cases towards clinical encounters faced by GI fellows, including one example in the general GI clinic and two in the inpatient setting. These were conducted in an open forum style, with the session leaders soliciting responses and opinions to these case-based situations from the audience. Participants completed a survey before and after the workshop. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The majority of participants had either suffered or witnessed discrimination at some point during their medical training (64.3%; 78.6%). Among our cohort, 6/7 (85.7%) of women reported facing discrimination, and 6/8 (75.0%) of those identifying with a racial minority had a personal experience of discrimination. The majority of participants enjoyed the session, felt that it was useful to fellows, and wanted this training to be conducted annually. In particular, 88.8% (8) of participants strongly agreed that the interactive cases were beneficial to their learning. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The prevalence of microaggressions toward URM and women in medicine requires institutional support and ongoing efforts to address systemic inequities in medicine, as they are associated with increased physician burnout, rates of depression, decreased performance, and poor job satisfaction. Additionally, in order to increase diversity in the pipeline of academic medicine, we must focus efforts on retaining our women and URM physicians.

The prevalence of burnout is higher in the medical profession than in other sectors#sup#1#/sup# and its presence can have significant repercussions, including on the quality of care#sup#2#/sup#. This study explores the feasibility of longitudinally tracking a well-being score for physicians in training at the Geneva University Hospitals - Division of Primary Care Medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Between September 2021 and November 2022, all physicians in training in this division were invited to complete online questionnaires: on arrival, at the end of each semester, and at the end of their training. The main tool was the ""Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index"" (PFI)#sup#3#/sup# which measures two Results: This study included 682 physicians, 278 (41%) men and 404 (59%) women aged 37+/-11 years (mean +/- standard deviation). Among respondents, 38% worked in university hospitals, 39% in other hospitals and 19% in private practice. Overall, a desire to quit their job was prevalent in 33% of respondents of either sex. Lack of the following workplace-related factors was associated with the desire to quit work in both sexes: having a good network, mentoring or supervisor's support, satisfaction with autonomy at work, workplace inclusiveness and a good work-life balance. Furthermore, perceived gender-related discrimination at work was associated with wanting to quit work. Sex differences existed in the following workplace factors: Men active in medical education and women active in research were less likely to want to quit work. Among personal factors, a pathological Physician Well-being index was associated with wanting to quit work in both sexes. A sex difference among personal factors was that men (but not women) who reported to have no adequate childcare were more likely to desire quitting work compared to those who reported to have adequate childcare. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study identified several potentially reversible factors associated with a tendency to consider quitting a physician job.

A subgroup analysis of physicians who had 3 data points was also conducted, showing that the individual longitudinal follow-up of PFI scores is possible. Analyses showed certain associations, including those between a positive SFU score and considering medicine as a vocation, or when the physicians reported being well supported in their personal development during the last semester. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): It is possible, and important, to collect and longitudinally monitor a well-being score within university hospital-based training programs in medicine. Certain elements emerge that can better explain the evolution of physicians' well-being.

Experiences of bias in a multidisciplinary hospital medicine group,Bromberg G.K.; ; Berwick J.R.; Horick N.K.; Burnett-Bowie S.-A.M.,"ABSTRACT: Clinicians report experiencing bias at work. Although previous studies have characterized these experiences among trainees and clinical faculty, ours is the first to describe experiences of bias within a multidisciplinary hospital medicine group. In our study, 82.5% of surveyed nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and physicians reported experiencing gender, racial, or other forms of bias in the workplace. In addition to women reporting higher rates of gender bias and Asian/Black/Latinx/multiracial/other race respondents reporting higher rates of racial bias, half of participants reported experiencing other forms of bias related to gender expression, perceived sexual orientation, body habitus, age, accent, country of origin, or perceived socioeconomic status. Respondents infrequently addressed bias with the person expressing it. Our study expands on the existing literature about experiences of bias by studying a large, multidisciplinary, academic hospital medicine group. With the increasing inclusion of NPs and PAs in hospital medicine, understanding their experiences will enable development of tailored interventions to reduce harm from experiences of bias.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Association of Nurse Practitioners.",2024,/,Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,,"(Bromberg, Berwick) Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States(Bromberg, Berwick, Burnett-Bowie) Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States(Horick) Biostatistics Center, ",,643223967,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000991,38214679,#452,Bromberg 2024,"",""
The prevalence of gender stereotypes in pharmacy student simulated counseling sessions utilizing standardized patients,Fellows S.E.; ; Maciulewicz T.; Conn K.; Patel V.,"Introduction: Simulation in healthcare has been a widely adopted modality to gain practical experience prior to working directly with patients. While simulation in academic settings affords many opportunities to enhance learning, it may also present an opportunity to identify cultural stereotypes. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of gender stereotypes in pharmacy student simulated counseling sessions. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Simulated counseling sessions completed across several cohorts of pharmacy students were reviewed. A video database of these counseling sessions was manually reviewed retrospectively to determine if students or trained actors portraying the role of the pharmacist and patient, respectively, assigned providers a gender without prompting. Secondary analysis included time to provider gender assignment and acknowledgement. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 73 unique counseling sessions were reviewed. Gender was preferentially assigned in 65 sessions. Assigned provider gender was male for all 65 cases. In most (45 out of 65) cases, gender was assigned by the actors. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Predetermined gender stereotypes exist in simulated counseling sessions.

Ten simple rules for a mom-friendly Academia,Sebastian-Gonzalez E.; ; Gracia E.; Moran-Ordonez A.; Perez-Ibarra I.; Sanz-Aguilar A.; Sobral M.,"Women (and all gender-discriminated people) are underrepresented in science, especially in leadership positions and higher stages of the scientific career. One of the main causes of career abandonment by women is maternity, with many women leaving Academia after having their first child because of the career penalties associated with motherhood. Thus, more actions to help scientific moms to balance family and academic work are urgently needed to increase representation of women and other gender discriminated people in Academia. Besides mothers, these rules may also benefit other groups such as mothers-to-be, fathers, caregivers, and women in general. Increasing women representation in science, including mothers, is critical because equality is a fundamental right, and because more diverse working environments are more productive and get to more optimal solutions.

Needs and Experiences of United States Female Urology Residents,Sheng M.; ; Chu A.; Catic A.; Hartsell L.; Mehta A.,"Objective: To identify factors influencing residency training program selection by women residents in urology and to evaluate the residents' gender-based experiences during training. Urology remains a disproportionately male-physician-dominated field. Understanding the needs and experiences of women residents is essential for developing strategies to recruit and retain more women urologists in independent practice. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An anonymous, 15-item web-based electronic survey was posted on social media and distributed via institutional email addresses between May and July 2021, targeted to all 461 current women U.S. urology residents. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and thematic analysis, respectively. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 147 complete responses were received. The most important factors influencing initial residency training program selection included geographic location/setting (37%) and institutional reputation (27%), compared to number of women faculty (3.4%) and women residents (0%). However, respondents cited a need for increased presence of women faculty and mentorship (36%), elimination of gender bias/harassment in the workplace (33%), and improved family support/maternity leave policies (15%) during residency to better foster clinical and academic growth of women residents. In interactions with patients, 97% reported not being recognized as a doctor, 84% reported stereotyping of women doctors, and 78% reported experiencing inappropriate treatment/harassment from male patients. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Geographic setting and institutional reputation were the most important factors for residency program selection by women urology residents. Although overlooked as a priority during the initial application process, current women urology residents seek increased women faculty presence, leadership and mentorship during residency to foster clinical and academic growth.

Participants expressed several challenges that women otolaryngologists face with respect to negotiation, including the absence of systematic formal negotiation training, gendered expectations that women experience during negotiations, and a perceived lack of power in negotiations. Obstacles to effective sponsorship included difficulty in the identification of sponsors and the influence of gender and related systemic biases that hindered sponsorship opportunities. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Notable gender disparities exist for negotiation and sponsorship in the midcareer stage for women otolaryngologists. Women start at a disadvantage due to a lack of negotiation training and access to sponsors, which is exacerbated by systemic gender bias and power differentials as women advance in their careers.

Women respondents were significantly younger than men, more likely to be assistant professors (32% vs 21%), and less likely to be full professors (18% vs 39%). Compared with men, women received equivalent grants and research support and had comparable or additional formal research training and mentorship. Women had less middle author publications (mean 5.8 [SD 9.2] vs mean 8.2 [SD 11.8], p = 0.03) compared with men but similar first or last author publications (mean 4.3[5.4] vs 6.1 [9.8], p = 0.05). A lower proportion of women presented research at grand rounds or at a national/international conference compared with men (58% vs 69%, p = 0.01). Women spent more time in nonprofessional responsibilities, were less satisfied with their work-life balance, and were less likely to agree with statements addressing equity/diversity and institutional climate.

"International Women in Biomechanics: Promoting, supporting, and sustaining the careers of women in biomechanics",Ebrahimi A.; ; Daniels K.A.J.; Gaffney B.M.M.; Banks C.L.; McDonald K.A.; Kessler S.E.; Maharaj J.N.,"Gender biases and inequities are prevalent across many scientific fields and biomechanics is likely no exception. While progress has been made to support women in the field, especially at biomechanics society conferences, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated professional isolation. The International Women in Biomechanics (IWB) community started in July 2020 with the mission of fostering an environment for women and other under-represented genders in biomechanics to gain year-round support, visibility, and allyship. Nearly 700 biomechanists have joined the IWB community from over 300 universities/organizations and 33 countries. Our community ranges in career stages and professions and interacts through a forum-style platform, teleconference meetings, and social media. In 2021, we conducted a survey to identify the needs, concerns, and issues faced by individuals in the IWB community. We received 144 responses from members in 16 countries. Our survey revealed three primary needs for women in biomechanics: supportive working environments, career planning support, and addressing workplace gender bias. These results, in conjunction with scientific evidence on workforce gender bias, helped us identify three key areas to meet our mission: Member Support, Community Outreach, and Empowering Allyship. Several levels of support are required in these three areas to ensure a lasting, positive, and sustainable impact on gender equity in biomechanics. We conclude by providing our perspectives on an evidence-based call to action to continue addressing gender bias and inequity at the individual, institutional, and scientific society levels. These actions can collectively enhance our allyship for women in the field of biomechanics.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022",2023,/,Journal of Biomechanics,146,"(Ebrahimi) Independent Researcher, Rockville, MD, United States(Daniels) Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom(Gaffney) University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, United States(Banks) Cen",111419,2022015537,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111419,36587460,#464,Ebrahimi 2023,"",""
The role of gender as a barrier to the professional development of psychiatrists,Kilic O.; ; Riecher-Rossler A.; Galderisi S.; Gorwood P.; Frangou S.; Pinto Da Costa M.,"Background Despite efforts toward greater gender equality in clinical and academic psychiatry in recent years, more information is needed about the challenges in professional development within psychiatry, and how these may vary with gender. Methods A cross-sectional 27-item online survey was conducted with psychiatrists and psychiatric trainee members of the European Psychiatric Association. Results A total of 561 psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees from 35 European countries participated representing a response rate of 52.8% for women and 17.7% for men from a total sample of 1,580. The specific challenges that women face in their professional development fall into two categories. One comprised women's negative attitudes concerning their abilities in self-promotion and networking. The other identified environmental barriers related to lack of opportunity and support and gender discrimination. Compared to men, women reported higher rates of gender discrimination in terms of professional advancement. Women were less likely to agree that their institutions had regular activities promoting inclusion, diversity, and training to address implicit gender bias. Working in high-income countries compared to middle-income countries relates to reporting institutional support for career progression. Conclusions These findings are an open call to hospital leaders, deans of medical schools, and department chairs to increase efforts to eradicate bias against women and create safer, inclusive, and respectful environments for all psychiatrists, a special call to women psychiatrists to be aware of inner tendencies to avoid self-promotion and networking and to think positively and confidently about themselves and their abilities.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s), 2023.

A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY FORMATION AMONG FEMALE INTERNAL MEDICINE TRAINEES,Cheng S.J.; ; Elkeshk S.; Goldberg T.,"BACKGROUND: Postgraduate medical training represents a crucial period in professional identity formation (PIF) for physician trainees. The ease of transition from medical student to physician can be challenging, particularly for those with pre-existing identities that have historically been marginalized within the profession. This study seeks to understand how gender informs the professional identity formation of female internal medicine residents over the course of residency training. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Using a qualitative approach based in grounded theory framework, we pursued a nuanced understanding of the adaptive process of PIF among internal medicine trainees. All self-identified females at a single internal medicine residency program in New York City were invited via email to participate in a focus group session. Using a semi-structured moderator guide, PGY-specific focus groups were conducted among 11 total participants in December 2021. Focus groups were transcribed, and an iterative 3-phase coding process was employed to identify central themes for each focus group. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Based on focus-group dialogue, PIF for female resident participants was a 3-phase process impacted by peer support and mentorship. PGY-1 participants described ""identity dissonance,"" which was characterized by frequent tensions between personal ideals of inhabiting the physician role and the reality of how they are treated by others and what is expected of them. They expended much time cognitively processing dismissive and negative interactions, which impacted their professional confidence. PGY-2 women described ""playing the role,"" a performative trial-and-error approach towards internalizing their role and responsibility as leaders. PGY-2 participants were attuned to how they were treated compared to male peers, and were conscientious to provide support to other women. By PGY-3 year, participants had learned to ""inhabit the role,"" demonstrating internalization of their professional competence, but increased clarity and frustration towards gender power dynamics. Peer support and mentorship bolstered their confidence, encouraging them to confront biases. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Among female internal medicine residents at a single institution, professional identity formation encompasses a 3-phase process, aligned with postgraduate year, which is bolstered by peer support and mentorship.

Interpersonal Interactions and Biases in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency: Do Experiences Differ Based on Gender?,Sobel A.D.; ; Lavorgna T.R.; Ames S.E.; Templeton K.J.; Mulcahey M.K.,"BackgroundWomen residents are underrepresented in orthopaedic surgery. The causes of the deficit of women in orthopaedic surgery are multifactorial, but by identifying the perceptions of women in orthopaedic residency training and comparing them with the perceptions of men, we can improve our understanding of ways to enhance the recruitment of qualified and diverse candidates.Questions/purposes(1) What differences exist in the perceived experiences of residents identifying as women and men regarding professional, social, and personal interactions during residency training? (2) Are there differences in the percentage of women and men residents who have experienced harassment or discrimination in preresidency interviews, and are there differences in the type of harassment or discrimination experienced?MethodsA survey was generated using Academy of Critical Care: Development, Evaluation, and Methodology guidelines. Two focus groups with seven attending orthopaedic surgeons who participate in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group and who are experts on gender diversity in orthopaedics were held to improve survey validity. The survey included binary-response, Likert, and free-text questions on the perception of professional, social, and personal interactions held by the resident being surveyed. The questions focused on a respondent's perception of interactions with staff members, patients, resident colleagues, and attending surgeons, as well as sexual harassment. Program directors at 10 selected Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited orthopaedic residency programs that participate in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group shared the survey with residents at their institutions. There were 95 programs in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group at the time this survey was distributed. In this program, directors or other interested teaching faculty in orthopaedic residency programs voluntarily participate to discuss and develop quality research on resident and fellow education. These 95 programs account for 46% of the ACGME-accredited programs in the United States at the time the survey was created and distributed. The 10 residency programs had a total of 232 enrolled residents; 15% (34) identified as women. This gender distribution models the national sample of orthopaedic residents. Survey reliability was assessed by calculating the Cronbach alpha after determining the variance in each relevant (nondemographic) survey item. The final survey was found to have excellent internal reliability (alpha = 0.95). Responses from residents identifying as women and those identifying as men were compared using Fisher exact tests for all categorical data, and two-tailed independent t-tests were used for all continuous data. Differences in each survey category (professional interactions, social interactions, personal interactions, and sexual harassment in preresidency interview experiences) were calculated.ResultsWomen reported experiencing microaggressions (left undefined to the survey respondent, but generally considered to be subtle, stunning, often automatic, and nonverbal exchanges that are ""put downs"") at work more frequently than men did (40% [six of 15] versus 5% [four of 74]; p < 0.001). Specifically, women perceived being interrupted (53% [eight of 15] versus 5% [four of 75]); p < 0.001) by men colleagues, called by their first name (67% [10 of 15] versus 4% [3 of 72]; p < 0.001), and given administrative tasks (27% [four of 15] versus 1% [one of 75]; p = 0.004) more often than men. More women than men perceived that patients (33% [five of 15] versus 0 of 74 [0%]; p < 0.001) and hospital staff (27% [four of 15] versus 7% [five of 74]; p = 0.01) respected their opinion less than that of men. More women than men perceived that group humor negatively targeted their gender (47% [seven of 15] versus 1% [one of 75]; p < 0.001) and that criticism of their surgical skill was based on their gender rather than their ability (33% [five of 15] versus 5% [four of 78]; p = 0.005). In residency or subinternship interviews, 20% of women reported experiencing sexual harassment as defined by a listing of known types of harassment in the question stem, compared with 0% of men (p = 0.004). Women reported harassment in the form of verbal remarks of a sexual nature and obscene images in the workplace, whereas men did not report any form of harassment during interviews.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the greatest discrepancies in the perceived experiences of women and men residents lie in professional interactions, and women residents are more likely to experience sexual harassment and disparaging humor than men residents.Clinical RelevanceAddressing these discrepancies, particularly in the professional setting, will help to create a more inclusive work environment and attract more women to orthopaedic surgery. Annual distribution of the survey used in this study by program directors to residents in their programs can help to identify discrepant perceptions that, coupled with the collection of objective data, can be targeted for improvement.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Women in academia and research: still a long way toward gender equality and inclusion in veterinary science and veterinary pathology?,Palmieri C.; ,"The experience of people working in academia and research who identify as women is very different to that of men. Discrepancies between men and women have been quite obvious for decades and the COVID-19 pandemic has just ""helped"" to enlarge this gap. One key finding presented in the Global Gender Gap Report of the World Economic Forum 2020 is that gender parity will not be achieved in the next 100 years. This should not be a setback (we are not going to be here in 100 years' time, so why bother?), but an incentive to re-group, plan and dismantle the pipeline. However, identifying the root causes and how to solve them all boil down to one thing: getting the right data, getting enough data and filling the gender data gap.

RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences is an academic and research institution as well as the national surgical training body for Ireland. Methods Over the past 5 years, RCSI has implemented several interventions aimed at making the University a more inclusive place for non-binary people. These interventions include: 1) providing gender neutral, or universal access, toilets and shower facilities; 2) facilitating Trans 101 training delivered by the Transgender Equality Network Ireland (TENI) for staff and students; 3) delivery and launch of a Gender Identity and Expression Policy (the third university in Ireland to launch and implement such a policy); 4) establishing a LGBTI+ staff network (prior to the EDI Unit's establishment, there is a thriving student PRIDE society); 5) hosting annual Pride celebrations; 6) raising the Pride and trans flags above RCSI annually since the inaugural raising in 2018; 7) supporting staff members transition at work (formally, e.g., updating HR, IT and pension records, or informally); 8) introducing the option of adding your pronouns to your email signature; 9) expanding the question set in RCSI's annual EDI Staff Survey to include a question capturing trans history to inform future actions and policies. The objective of introducing these initiatives is to foster a trans inclusive environment, increase engagement in LBGTI+ related activities and strengthen the values of dignity and respect for all at RCSI.

Leadership Curriculum for Critical Care Medicine Fellows,Irons C.; ; Miller C.; Thati A.; Matta M.,"RATIONALE: Although leadership training in the critical care setting is not new, its critical importance became clear during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, where trainees needed to embrace a changing healthcare landscape, foster teamwork, and innovate in order to deliver quality patient care. In a national survey, 73% of program directors agreed that leadership education should be a mandatory part of fellowship training. However, 68% reported less than three hours of leadership training during all three years, often citing barriers such as a lack of time to develop/deliver material and lack of funding (1). The purpose of this project is to provide a formal and dedicated leadership curriculum for all fellows training in critical care medicine at our institution, recognizing that regardless of whether fellows desire leadership positions following training, all critical care physicians will be expected to lead. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a collaboration between our program and Weather head School of Management, we developed a leadership curriculum for critical care fellows. Topics include understanding self (learning styles, career anchors, developing a 5-10 year plan), managing teams (crisis leadership), and influencing the environment (women in leadership, diversity equity and inclusion). These sessions (didactics and small group format) were each one hour in duration and delivered over a six-month time span with zoom and in-person option. Participants for this study included critical care fellows from medicine, anesthesia, emergency medicine, and neurology programs. Faculty were also encouraged to attend and participate. A learning needs assessment, individual session assessment, and post-course survey were conducted. Long-term outcomes evaluating fellow participation in leadership positions after graduation are being collected. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Fifteen fellows completed the learning needs assessment, and ten out of fifteen fellows completed the post-course survey. There was an improvement in pre and post survey questions (figure 1). Following the course, 9/10 participants reported that they could imagine how their career would be 10 years after fellowship, and the majority of fellows felt adequately prepared to lead a team through the next pandemic. 9/10 participants felt prepared to address micro aggressions in the workplace. 100% of respondents reported the leadership curriculum was helpful to their career, and they would recommend repeating it. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The intensive care unit will continue to be directly affected by the changing landscape in healthcare, and equipping fellows to become leaders in a field constantly affected by this change will benefit the healthcare system as a whole.",2023,/,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,207,1,,641646805,https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2023.C23,,#471,Irons 2023,"",""
A Multimodal Curriculum To Improve Medical Student Gender-affirming Communication Skills,Jones R.B.; ; Maskart C.; Radway J.M.; Amaro A.; Cardillo S.,"Introduction: Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people, whose gender identities and/or expression(s) exist outside the gender binary, are marginalized in healthcare. They often meet medical providers who do not have the skills or experience to address issues relevant to TGD persons. This can lead to suboptimal care and in some situations, micro- or macroaggressions. Physicians can help create a welcoming environment for gender-diverse people by addressing them in a respectful and affirming way. Physicians and trainees, however, rarely receive formal instruction or simulated training to practice providing gender-affirming care. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The goal of the session was to give medical students an opportunity to observe, practice, and debrief medical encounters with gender-diverse patients. We collaborated with TGD standardized patients (SPs) and the standardized patient program to design a multimodal communication skills session: - 20-minute didactic lecture reviewing health care disparities affecting gender-diverse individuals and examples of gender-affirming language - 15-minute video encounter showing a provider misgendering aTGD SP then recovering, followed by a provider not misgendering the patient - 45-minute small group session where students take a history for a patient beginning hormone treatment to facilitate gender transition. Students receive feedback from the SP and preceptor. Notable design characteristics include TGD SPs involved in the curriculum and case scenario creation, piloting of the session, and recruitment of only faculty preceptors with clinical experience in gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT) to facilitate sessions. Results/Conclusions: 124 students completed the curriculum. Prior to and one week after the curriculum, students completed a 5-point self-assessment survey measuring six items: pronoun use, recovery from misgendering, communication skills with TGD knowledge, ability to take a targeted history, mental health effects of GAHT, and how to assess for treatment goals, skills, and attitudes with respect to gender-diverse healthcare. 85 students completed the pre-survey and 32 students completed the postsurvey. When results were dichotomized to low (1-3 on scale) and high (4-5) comfort or ability, over 50% of students who completed the post-survey changed from low to high in their self-rated ability to take a targeted history, knowledge of the mental health effects of GAHT and how to assess for treatment goals. Qualitatively, SPs thought preceptors were particularly knowledgeable and affirming in the topic. Student feedback suggested the need for smaller group sizes which will be adapted for future iterations.",2023,/,Journal of the Endocrine Society,7,Supplement 1,A1101,642708004,https://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvad114.2073,,#472,Jones 2023,"",""
Decadal Plan Champions addressing gender equality,Arabia A.-M.; ; Ghirardello Z.,"The Australian Academy of Science (the Academy) is spearheading the development of critical national frameworks for diversity and inclusion to guide transformative, systematic and sustained change in Australia's STEM sector. In collaboration with the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, the Academy co-authored the Women in STEM Decadal Plan, a 10-year strategy to lift the participation of girls and women in STEM education and careers. The plan outlines six opportunities for stakeholders-government, academia, industry, education, and the broader community-who have the power to achieve gender equity by 2030. As the steward for the plan, the Academy coordinates the Women in STEM Decadal Plan Champions initiative enabling STEM sector organisations to publicly align their initiatives to achieve gender equity with the six opportunity areas detailed in the Plan: leadership and cohesion; evaluation; workplace culture; visibility; education; industry action. Over 40 organisations have become Decadal Plan Champions over the last 3 years. Their gender equity actions provide a source of ideas and inspiration for everyone wishing to support girls and women in STEM. Aligning actions with the Plan means the Australian STEM sector can push in the same direction to achieve gender equity by 2030. All Champions display visible leadership from their executive teams and demonstrate efforts to improve the visibility of women in STEM roles. The adoption of varying forms of inclusive workplace practices such as flexible work, paid parental leave policies, domestic violence leave, and training are common. Women earn 12.4% less than their counterparts and pay equity remains a persistent challenge for the sector. This abstract showcases the efforts and successes of four Champions from different industries. Analysis of other actions and gaps will be presented orally. Opportunity 2: Evaluation - QinetiQ conducts an annual gender pay gap analysis conducted using the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) gender pay gap calculator, and reports openly on their progress towards gender quality, including an increase in the representation of women in their executive leadership team from 25% to 40% and an increase in the overall recruitment ratio of women from 19.5% to 23%. Opportunity 3: Workplace culture - Department of Defence has collaborated with Defence industry partners in a women's mentoring program called 'The Future Through Collaboration', which has provided 284 women working in Defence and Defence Industry with an opportunity for mentorship that may otherwise not have been available. Opportunity 4: Visibility - Macquarie University has established gender equity targets in their marketing strategy and now undertakes regular reporting, resulting in an increase in female representation to 45% in internal and external media channels. Opportunity 5: Education - CSIRO developed the Young Indigenous Women's STEM Academy which in 2021 is supporting 308 young Indigenous women across Australia to engage with a range of STEM experiences virtually throughout COVID-19. To achieve gender equity, it is vital that long-term and sustainable changes are implemented across the STEM sector, which is why initiatives such as the Women in STEM Decadal Plan and Champions are instrumental.",2023,/,BMC Proceedings,17,Supplement 15,,643048920,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12919-023-00275-w,,#473,Arabia 2023,"",""
IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A NOVEL ANTIRACISM CURRICULUM FOR A PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY TEAM,Person H.; ; Montenegro R.,"Background: The field of pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology, and its providers, are not immune to bias and racist ideologies that adversely influence patient care. There is a high demand for antiracism training, but a simultaneous dearth of evidence-based curricula. Bias Reduction in Medicine (BRIM) is one of the earliest education intervention studies in physicians, showing a statistically significant and positive change in gender bias. This curriculum provides self-regulation skills to reduce bias attitudes and behaviors. With permission, it has been modified to BRIM Pediatrics+ (BRIMP+), a pediatric-specific curriculum focusing on racism and antiracism. This curriculum was further modified to be specialty-specific and was piloted for the Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Seattle Children's Hospital from October 2022 through January 2023. <ovid:br/>Method(s): BRIM was modified to BRIMP+, creating a four-workshop series for teams, with individual pre- and post-workshop self-study totaling a 10-hour commitment. Workshops were designed with scaffolded learning objectives to increase learner awareness and identification of racism, build learner skills in antiracism, and enhance learner motivation to practice antiracism. Antiracism skills were adapted from evidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies. The curriculum was made specialty-specific, including relevant case discussions and health equity literature. BRMP+ was piloted with the Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Seattle Children's Hospital prior to a planned observational study across all the pediatric faculty at the University of Washington. Specific aims were to assess learner engagement and experience and assess learner-reported differences in antiracism knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Engagement was defined as completion of at least 80% of the curriculum materials. Learners completed a survey assessing their awareness of racism, confidence in participating in antiracism, and their perception of the diversity and inclusion of their workplace before, and three months after BRIMP+. They completed surveys after each workshop providing feedback on their experience. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize these responses. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 17 faculty members enrolled in BRIMP+, 12 completed the curriculum, with most non-completion due to incomplete workshop attendance. Of all faculty, 5 identified as BIPOC, with one identifying as Black. Workshop feedback surveys (n = 11-16) suggested respondents felt learning objectives were met across workshops, with all respondents answering the objectives were somewhat, mostly, or definitely met. When asked their level of knowledge before and after each workshop related to the educational content, there were consistent trends in respondents reporting increased knowledge, particularly in understanding the manifestations of racism and anti-Black racism. When asked about confidence in enacting antiracism skills post-workshop, the majority of respondents answered they felt somewhat or very capable. Notably, after the first and second workshop, 1 to 2 respondents consistently reported feeling 'not at all' capable across all skill sets, which involved recognizing racism, managing strong emotions, and using a standardized framework to approach antiracism interventions. After the third and fourth workshop, all respondents reporting feeling somewhat or very capable in all skills, which focused on challenging internal, interpersonal, and institutional instances of racism. To date, 9 faculty members have completed the post- BRIMP+ survey with consistently reported importance of and confidence in engaging in antiracism but no obvious post-intervention trends identified. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first report of a pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology-specific antiracism curriculum, and this represents a new direction in the landscape of antibias interventions in healthcare to be more germane to the learner and emphasize concrete skills in antiracism. Our curriculum was generally well received by learners, though individual completion of the entirety of the curriculum was varied. Learner focus groups are underway to further assess the reasons for this, and preliminary feedback suggests the time commitment and competing demands served as significant barriers to curriculum completion. Overall, there was consistent positive feedback related to learner experience, with all participants feeling learning objectives were at least somewhat met and the vast majority describing confidence in enacting antiracism skills. Ongoing investigation at Seattle Children's Hospital will assess these and other metrics of diversity, equity, and inclusion longitudinally as BRIMP+ is enacted across the institution, allowing a more robust analysis of the potential individual, team, and institutional effects of BRMIP+.",2023,/,Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition,77,1 Supplement 1,S99,642509465,,,#474,Person 2023,"",""
Overcoming the gender bias in ecology and evolution: is the double-anonymized peer review an effective pathway over time?,Cassia-Silva C.; ; Rocha B.S.; Lievano-Latorre L.F.; Sobreiro M.B.; Diele-Viegas L.M.,"Male researchers dominate scientific production in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, potential mechanisms to avoid this gender imbalance remain poorly explored in STEM, including ecology and evolution areas. In the last decades, changes in the peer-review process towards double-anonymized (DA) have increased among ecology and evolution (EcoEvo) journals. Using comprehensive data on articles from 18 selected EcoEvo journals with an impact factor >1, we tested the effect of the DA peer-review process in female-leading (i.e., first and senior authors) articles. We tested whether the representation of female-leading authors differs between double and single-anonymized (SA) peer-reviewed journals. Also, we tested if the adoption of the DA by previous SA journals has increased the representativeness of female-leading authors over time. We found that publications led by female authors did not differ between DA and SA journals. Moreover, female-leading articles did not increase after changes from SA to DA peer-review. Tackling female underrepresentation in science is a complex task requiring many interventions. Still, our results highlight that adopting the DA peer-review system alone could be insufficient in fostering gender equality in EcoEvo scientific publications. Ecologists and evolutionists understand how diversity is important to ecosystems' resilience in facing environmental changes. The question remaining is: why is it so difficult to promote and keep this ""diversity"" in addition to equity and inclusion in the academic environment? We thus argue that all scientists, mentors, and research centers must be engaged in promoting solutions to gender bias by fostering diversity, inclusion, and affirmative measures.<ovid:br/>Copyright 2023 Cassia-Silva et al.",2023,/,PeerJ,11,"(Cassia-Silva) Department of Plant Biology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, SP, Campinas, Brazil(Cassia-Silva, Rocha, Lievano-Latorre, Sobreiro, Diele-Viegas) Kunha Ase Network of Women in Science, Bahia, Salvador, Brazil(Rocha) INRAE, Aix M",e15186,2024204223,https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.15186,,#475,Cassia-Silva 2023,"",""
The Majority of Black Orthopaedic Surgeons Report Experiencing Racial Microaggressions During Their Residency Training,Brooks J.T.; ; Porter S.E.; Middleton K.K.; Carson E.W.; Ode G.E.,"BackgroundOrthopaedic surgery is the least-diverse surgical specialty based on race and ethnicity. To our knowledge, the impact of this lack of diversity on discriminatory or noninclusive experiences perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during their residency training has never been evaluated. Racial microaggressions were first defined in the 1970s as ""subtle verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group.""Although the term ""microaggression""has long been established, more recently, as more workplaces aim to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion, it has entered the medical profession's lexicon as a means of describing the spectrum of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in the healthcare environment.Question/purposes(1) What is the extent of discrimination that is perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during residency? (2) What subtypes of racial microaggressions (which encompasses racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion) do Black orthopaedic surgeons experience during residency training, and who are the most common initiators of these microaggressions? (3) What feedback statements could be perceived as racially biased to Black orthopaedic surgeons in residency training? (4) Are there gender differences in the reported types of racial microaggressions recalled by Black respondents during residency training?MethodsAn anonymous survey was administered between July 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020, to practicing orthopaedic surgeons, residents, and fellows in the J. Robert Gladden Orthopaedic Society database who self-identify as Black. There were 455 Black orthopaedic surgeons in practice and 140 Black orthopaedic residents or fellows in the database who met these criteria. Fifty-two percent (310 of 595) of participants responded. Fifty-three percent (243 of 455) were practicing surgeons and 48% (67 of 140) were current residents or fellows. Respondents reported their perception of discrimination in the residency workplace using a modified version of the single-item Perceived Occupational Discrimination Scale and were asked to recall any specific examples of experiences with racial discrimination, bias, or exclusion during their training. Examples were later categorized as different subtypes of racial microaggressions and were quantified through a descriptive analysis and compared by gender.ResultsAmong survey respondents, 34% (106 of 310) perceived a lot of residency workplace discrimination, 44% (137 of 310) perceived some residency workplace discrimination, 18% (55 of 310) perceived a little residency workplace discrimination, and 4% (12 of 310) perceived no residency workplace discrimination. Categorized examples of racial microaggressions experienced in residency were commonly reported, including being confused for a nonphysician medical staff (nurse or physician's assistant) by 87% (271 of 310) of respondents or nonmedical staff (janitorial or dietary services) by 81% (250 of 310) of respondents. Racially explicit statements received during residency training were reported by 61% (190 of 310) of respondents. Thirty-eight percent (117 of 310) of such statements were reportedly made by patients and 18% (55 of 310) were reportedly made by attending faculty. Fifty percent (155 of 310) of respondents reported receiving at least one of nine potentially exclusionary or devaluing feedback statements during their residency training. Among those respondents, 87% (135 of 155) perceived at least one of the statements to be racially biased in its context. The three feedback statements that, when received, were most frequently perceived as racially biased in their context was that the respondent ""matched at their program to fulfill a diversity quota""(94% [34 of 36]), the respondent was unfriendly compared with their peers (92% [24 of 26]), or that the respondent was ""intimidating or makes those around him/her uncomfortable""(88% [51 of 58]). When compared by gender, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken for janitors and dietary services at 97% (63 of 65), compared with Black men at 77% (187 of 244; p < 0.01). In addition, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken as nurses or physician assistants (100% [65 of 65]) than Black men did (84% [205 of 244]) during orthopaedic residency training (p < 0.01). Black women also more frequently reported receiving potentially devaluing or exclusionary feedback statements during residency training.ConclusionPerception of workplace discrimination during orthopaedic residency training is high (96%) among Black orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. Most respondents reported experiencing discrimination, bias, and exclusion that could be categorized as specific subtypes of racial microaggressions. Several different examples of racial microaggressions were more commonly reported by Black women. Certain feedback statements were frequently perceived as racially biased by recipients.Clinical RelevanceTo better understand barriers to the successful recruitment and retention of Black physicians in orthopaedics, the extent of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in residency training must be quantified. This study demonstrates that racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion during residency, wholly categorized as racial microaggressions, are frequently recalled by Black orthopaedic surgeons. A better understanding of the context of these experiences of Black trainees is a necessary starting point for the development of a more inclusive workplace training environment in orthopaedic surgery.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.

GENDER INFLUENCES ON TEAM WORK PERFORMANCE,Moka E.; ; Rekatsina M.; Siafaka I.; Vadalouka A.,"Gender influences on teamwork performance in the fields of anaesthesia and pain medicine, but also in scientific societies can be complex and multifaceted. While it is important to recognize that individual variations exist within genders, research has shown that gender can play a role in team dynamics and performance in these fields. A variety of factors that need to be considered have been identified across literature. Stereotypes and Bias Gender stereotypes and biases can affect team dynamics and performance. Stereotypes about gender roles and abilities may influence how team members perceive and evaluate each other's contributions. For example, unconscious biases may lead to women being perceived as less competent or authoritative, which can impact their ability to effectively contribute to team decisions and leadership roles. Communication Styles Men and women may have different communication styles, which can impact teamwork. Research suggests that women tend to use more collaborative and inclusive communication styles, while men may adopt more assertive and direct approaches. These differences can affect how individuals interact, contribute ideas, and make decisions within a team setting. Leadership Opportunities Gender disparities in leadership positions can affect teamwork dynamics. Scientific societies, anaesthesia departments and academic communities may have a higher proportion of male leaders, leading to potential imbalances in decision-making power and the allocation of resources. This can influence team dynamics and hinder equal participation and collaboration among team members. Implicit Biases and Perception of Expertise: Implicit biases can influence the perception of expertise and competence in team members. These biases may lead to women's contributions being undervalued or overlooked, even when they possess the necessary skills and knowledge. This can hinder team performance and create an unequal distribution of tasks and responsibilities. Work-life Balance and Career Advancement Gender-related challenges, such as managing work-life balance, can impact team performance. Women in scientific societies and anaesthesia communities may face additional pressures related to family responsibilities and societal expectations, which can affect their availability, participation, and career advancement opportunities. These challenges can impact teamwork dynamics and overall performance. Addressing gender influences on teamwork performance requires promoting gender equity, fostering inclusive team cultures, and challenging biases and stereotypes. Encouraging equal representation, providing leadership and mentorship opportunities, and promoting diversity and inclusivity initiatives can help mitigate these influences and create more effective and equitable teams. Additionally, awareness training and interventions aimed at reducing biases can support improved communication and collaboration among team members. In this context, a multi-faceted approach is required, with proposed strategies having the possibility to be implemented, as they are analyzed below. Promoting Diversity and Inclusivity Actively work towards creating diverse and inclusive teams by promoting equal opportunities for individuals of all genders. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment and hiring practices, ensuring diverse representation in leadership positions, and creating a supportive and inclusive work environment. Providing Training and Education Offer training programs and workshops that address unconscious biases, gender stereotypes, and communication styles. Provide education on the importance of inclusive teamwork and the value of diverse perspectives. This can help team members develop awareness and skills to mitigate biases and foster effective collaboration. Encouraging Mentorship and Sponsorship Establish mentorship and sponsorship programs that specifically support women in anaesthesia and scientific societies. Mentors can provide guidance, support, and advocacy to help women navigate career challenges and advancement opportunities. Sponsors can actively promote the visibility and recognition of talented individuals, helping to minimize gender biases in decision-making processes. Implementing Flexible Work Policies Support work-life balance by implementing flexible work policies that accommodate diverse needs. This includes providing options for parental leave, flexible working hours, and remote work arrangements. By reducing the impact of gender-related challenges on individuals' professional lives, team members can better contribute to and participate in teamwork. Fostering Inclusive Communication Encourage open and inclusive communication within teams. Promote equal participation and active listening, ensuring that everyone's perspectives are valued and considered. Create a culture where individuals feel comfortable expressing their ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of bias or judgment. Establishing clear evaluation criteria Develop clear and objective performance evaluation criteria that focus on skills, achievements, and contributions rather than gender. Train evaluators to be aware of potential biases and provide them with tools to make fair and unbiased assessments. Supporting Work-Life Integration Create a supportive environment that acknowledges and supports the integration of work and personal life responsibilities. Offer resources such as onsite childcare, family-friendly policies, and support networks to help individuals manage their professional and personal commitments effectively. Conducting Ongoing Research and Analysis Continuously monitor and analyze team performance, gender disparities, and barriers to inclusion. Collect data on team dynamics, leadership positions, and career advancement to identify areas for improvement and implement evidence-based strategies. It is essential to approach these strategies holistically and continuously evaluate their effectiveness. Creating a genderinclusive environment requires ongoing commitment, engagement, and a willingness to challenge and transform existing norms and biases.",2023,/,Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine,48,Supplement 1,A375EP  - A376,643992489,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2023-ESRA.683,,#477,Moka 2023,"",""

Unveiling Gender Disparities: Female Authorship in Pivotal Trials for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-Approved Novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapies,Farooq M.; ; Sohail A.; Khan S.; Ukrani J.; Zahid I.; Hassan M.; Jaglal M.V.,"Introduction CAR-T cell therapy, an FDA-approved breakthrough in hematologic malignancy treatment, has emerged as a game-changer through rigorous pivotal trials. Reportedly, women were underrepresented as authors in pivotal trials supporting approval of novel hematological drugs [1]. However, gender inequity in authorship across pivotal trials of FDA-approved novel CAR-T cell therapies remains unexamined. Thus, our study explores gender representation among authors in pivotal trials that led to the first-ever FDA approval of CAR-T cell therapies for hematological malignancies Methods Drugs@FDA portal was searched for novel CAR-T cell therapies approved between 2015 and 2022. Drug approval labels were searched to identify all pivotal trials listed in Section 14 under ""Clinical Studies."" Only pivotal trials with corresponding trial publications were included in this study. The gender of trial authors was captured as binary (women and men) and was identified by using the Genderize software (Demografix ApS) or by verifying personal pronouns on authors' institutional profiles or other sources. Study-level estimates for the proportion of women authors were pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analysis of proportions model. Analyses were conducted with OpenMeta [Analyst] software version 10.12. Results From 2017-2022, the FDA approved a total of 6 novel CAR-T cell therapies, corresponding to 6 trials and 7 trial publications (755 participants) that were included in the study (Table 1). One trial's findings were reported in two distinct publications. A total of 201 authors were screened, and 1 was excluded because of the inability to assign author gender. Genderize was used to identify the gender of 177 authors; 152 were further confirmed by checking personal pronouns. Of the 24 authors with a prediction probability estimate less than 90.0% on Genderize, author gender was identified for 23 by using personal pronouns listed in institutional profiles or other sources. The median number of men and women authors of trial publications was 19 (IQR, 15-23) and 9 (IQR, 6-11), respectively. The overall proportion of women authors was 29.6% (95% CI, 20.5%-38.7%). The proportion of women authors varied significantly across the 7 trial publications (p-heterogeneity = 0.043). The proportion of women as first and senior authors was the same, estimating about 14.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-40.2%). Conclusions Our study highlights gender disparities in the authorship of pivotal efficacy trials supporting the FDA approval of novel CAR-T cell therapies. This underscores the urgent need for institutions to devise tailored policies that tackle the unique challenges faced by women in the medical field, while fostering an inclusive and supportive workplace environment that empowers women to achieve academic success.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 The American Society of Hematology",2023,/,Blood,142,Supplement 1,7217,2028763869,https://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-181334,,#479,Farooq 2023,"",""
MOVING THE NEEDLE FOR WOMEN IN GASTROENTEROLOGY: ACQUIRING LEADERSHIP SKILLS FOR CAREER GROWTH!,Syed N.; ; Advani R.; Afzali A.; Charabaty A.,"Background Despite women constituting 48% of medical professionals, only 19% of gastroenterologists (GI) are female. This gender disparity arises from factors including lack of effective mentoring, unequal leadership and career advancements, and pay inequity. In this context, ""Scrubs & Heels"" (S&H) is a unique and innovative mission-driven organization focused on the professional and personal development of women in GI. The agenda of the first S&H Summit in 2022 provided attendees with leadership skills and networking opportunities to help advance their careers (Figure 1). We aimed to assess the impact of the Summit's agenda on the confidence level of attendees in their leadership skills and in taking specific actions towards improving their career. Methods Attendees of S&H Summit 2022 completed a pre-Summit survey corresponding to topics addressed in the agenda. A post-Summit survey was emailed 8 months after the Summit to assess if Summit attendance had a short-medium term impact on the attendee's confidence in different skills and action items. Most of the survey questions asked ""how confident are you"" in several categories and contained options: Not at all, Somewhat, Confident. Questions asking whether the attendees identified a mentor/sponsor, or sought professional opportunities/coaching had the following options: Yes, I want to, No. The pre- and post-Summit responses were compared using Fisher exact tests, p<0.05. Results Of the 140 attendees at the S&H Summit, nearly 100 answered some or all of the pre-Summit questions. A total of 68 attendees completed the post-Summit survey: 35% were trainees, 51% had 1-12 years of practice, 13% had > 12 years of practice, and 18% were non-MD clinicians. Most respondents practiced in academia (69%) and 26% in a private practice. There was a statistically significant improvement in attendees' confidence to negotiate a contract, formulate a business plan, pursue a professional opportunity, speak in public, manage personal finances, and work with a professional coach (Table 1). For instance, 9% vs 75% of respondents indicated having the confidence to negotiate a work contract, before and after the Summit, respectively. Similarly, 5% vs 81% of attendees were somewhat confident or confident in managing finances, pre and post- Summit, respectively. Although the numbers did not reach statistical significance, attendees were more likely to seek and establish mentorship after the Summit (30% pre vs 59% post), and promote diversity and equity in their workplace (35% vs 63%). Conclusions S&H Summit 2022 had a profoundly positive impact on improving the confidence of women in GI to pursue opportunities for advancing their career and acquiring leadership skills.

UNDERSTANDING MICROAGGRESSION RESPONSE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENTS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER,Famouri M.L.; ; Sharkey C.; Schnell A.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that microaggressions have a large impact on medical trainees, particularly learners who identify as underrepresented in medicine (URM) or women. Many innovations in medical education have been developed in recent years to improve the clinical learning environment for trainees, including implicit bias training and upstander workshops to teach microaggression response to members of the healthcare team. We developed a needs assessment survey as part of a workshop on microaggression response training to better understand residents' experiences with microaggressions and skills in addressing microaggressions in clinical encounters as a baseline to assess the effectiveness of the training. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): 33 PGY-2 and PGY-3 categorical internal medicine residents participated in an upstander training workshop to learn about microaggressions and strategies to respond to microaggressions in patient encounters. Prior to the workshop, participants completed a virtual survey consisting of 18 questions with Likert responses that assessed their knowledge and experience related to microaggressions, response to microaggressions, and the frequency of observed microaggressions during their training. Due to the small sample size, residents were also asked whether they identified with a minoritized group to maintain anonymity. The survey was delivered by email through Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were completed to compare responses by gender and identification with a minoritized group. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 33 residents completed the survey. 17 (51.5%) identified as female and 4 (12.1%) identified as part of a minoritized group. No residents reported that they were very or extremely comfortable acting in reducing microaggressions, while 4 (12.1%) reported that they were uncomfortable taking action to reduce microaggressions. 29 (87.9%) of respondents reported that they rarely or sometimes experienced microaggressions from patients. 2 (6.1%) reported experiencing microaggressions often or very often. 22 (66.7%) reported that they rarely or sometimes acted when a microaggression was directed at a coworker; 9 (27.3%) reported that they never took action. For those that took action against a microaggression directed at a coworker, the most commonly cited strategy was discussing the situation with the recipient of the microaggression (95.7%). Fisher exact tests showed no statistically significant differences in the responses by gender or identification with a minoritized group, likely due to the small sample size. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Despite the small sample size, our survey responses suggest that residents may not be comfortable addressing microaggressions and rarely take action when microaggressions occur in clinical settings.

Harvard Medical School's Sexual and Gender Minority Health Equity Initiative: Curricular and Climate Innovations in Undergraduate Medical Education,Keuroghlian A.S.; ; Charlton B.M.; Katz-Wise S.L.; Williams K.; Jarvie E.J.; Phillips R.; Kremen J.; Guss C.E.; Dalrymple J.L.; Potter J.,"PROBLEM: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations face numerous health disparities. Medical school curricula lack adequate educational content preparing students for serving SGM patients, and medical students typically do not experience welcoming, inclusive educational environments conducive to learning about SGM health care. APPROACH: In 2018, Harvard Medical School (HMS) launched the 3-year Sexual and Gender Minority Health Equity Initiative to integrate SGM health content throughout the longitudinal core medical curriculum and cultivate an educational climate conducive for engaging students and faculty in SGM health education. The initiative employed innovative strategies to comprehensively review existing SGM health curricular content and climate; integrate content across courses and clerkships; lead with LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and all sexual and gender minorities) community engagement; adopt an intersectional approach that centers racial equity; cultivate safe, affirming educational environments for LGBTQIA+ and non-LGBTQIA+ students and staff; ensure all graduating students are prepared to care for SGM patients; enhance faculty knowledge, skills, attitudes, and confidence teaching SGM health; evaluate effectiveness and impact of SGM health curricular innovations; prioritize sustainability of curricular innovations; and publicly share and disseminate SGM health curricular products and tools. <ovid:br/>OUTCOME(S): Key outcomes of the initiative focused on 5 areas: development of 9 SGM health competencies, stakeholder engagement (HMS students and faculty, national SGM health experts, and LGBTQIA+ community members), student life and educational climate (increased LGBTQIA+ student matriculants, enhanced mentorship and support), curriculum development (authentic LGBTQIA+ standardized patient experiences, clerkship toolkit design), and faculty development (multimedia curriculum on content and process to teach SGM health). NEXT STEPS: In addition to refining curricular integration, evaluating interventions, and implementing comprehensive antiracist and gender-affirming educational policies, the next phase will involve dissemination by translating best practices into feasible approaches that any school can adopt to meet local needs with available resources.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s).

Exploring the Prototypical Definitions of Intelligent Engineers Held by Irish and Swedish Higher Education Engineering Students,Buckley J.; ; Hyland T.; Gumaelius L.; Seery N.; Pears A.,"Males are generally overrepresented in higher education engineering. However, the magnitude of this variance differs between countries and engineering fields. Evidence associated with the field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis suggests that perceptions of intelligence held by actors within engineering affects the engagement of underrepresented groups. This study examined perceptions of an intelligent engineer held by undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students in Ireland and Sweden, countries selected based on their levels of female representation in engineering education. It was hypothesised that there would be a significant difference in perceptions between countries. A survey methodology was employed in which a random sample of Irish and Swedish university students completed two surveys. The first asked respondents to list characteristics of an intelligent engineer, and the second asked for ratings of importance for each unique characteristic. The results indicate that an intelligent engineer was perceived to be described by seven factors; practical problem solving, conscientiousness, drive, discipline knowledge, reasoning, negative attributes, and inquisitiveness when the data was analysed collectively, but only the five factors of practical problem solving, conscientiousness, drive, discipline knowledge and negative attributes were theoretically interpretable when the data from each country was analysed independently. A gender x country interaction effect was observed for each of these five factors. The results suggest that the factors which denote intelligence in engineering between Irish and Swedish males and females are similar, but differences exist in terms of how important these factors are in terms group level definitions. Future work should consider the self-concepts held by underrepresented groups with respect to engineering relative to the factors observed in this study.",2022,/,Psychological reports,125,3,1397EP  - 1437,634558062,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00332941211000667,33709829,#483,Buckley 2022,"",""

Academics as Agentic Superheroes: Female academics' lack of fit with the agentic stereotype of success limits their career advancement,Van Veelen R.; ; Derks B.,"Gender gaps in academia persist with women being less likely to attain leadership, earning lower salaries, and receiving less research funding and resources compared to their male peers. The current research demonstrates yet another, more intangible gender gap in academia called lack of fit, whereby compared to male academics, female academics perceive higher misfit between their professional self-concept and the agentic 'superhero' stereotype of the successful academic. The entire population of Dutch academics (i.e., assistant, associate, and full professors from 14 universities) was approached to participate in a nationwide survey. Results from this unique dataset (N = 3978) demonstrate that academics perceive agency (e.g., self-confident, self-focused, competitive) as more descriptive of the stereotypical successful academic than communality (e.g., team-oriented, good teacher, collegial). Importantly, early career female academics perceived highest lack of fit with this narrowly-defined agentic occupational stereotype, which was correlated with lower work engagement, professional identification and career efficacy, and higher work exhaustion and exit intentions. Thus, lack of fit seems yet another barrier contributing to pervasive gender gaps in academia. Implications for building more inclusive academic cultures, where not only agentic but also communal academic practice is recognized and rewarded are discussed.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors.

Assessment of healthy lifestyles in relation to BMI,Simkova S.; ; Dvorackova O.; Veleminsky M.,"THEORETICAL BASIS: A sedentary lifestyle, consumption of inappropriate food, smoking or alcohol consumption can contribute to the overall deterioration of lifestyle and lead to weight gain. Lifestyle includes nutrition, physical activity, sleep, psychological well-being, good relationships or job satisfaction. We can influence some parts of our lifestyle, but we cannot influence many other factors like genetic predisposition or the environment in which we live. OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: The objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship between lifestyle and BMI (Body Mass Index), as well as differences based on age and sex. METHODOLOGY: A self-constructed questionnaire containing 71 questions was used to determine information about lifestyle. The collected data was based on the assessment of body mass index (BMI) and age, all respondents were measured using the stadiometer and InBody 270. The group included 323 adults (156 men and 167 women) and was divided according to BMI (BMI lower than 25 kg/m<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>, and BMI of 25 kg/m<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> or higher). The selected lifestyle characteristics were grouped to create a positive score including positive lifestyle factors, a negative score including negative lifestyle factors, and an overall healthy lifestyle score that included positive and negative scores. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): We found out that physiological BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>) was more common in respondents with higher education and students. The most respondents prefer omnivorous diet, in lower BMI group were mainly non-smokers and occasional consumers of alcohol, in comparison to higher BMI group where were former smokers and those who abstained from alcohol. All scales of lifestyle are sex-related and negative healthy lifestyle score also depend on BMI. Effect of age is not significant. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): According to our study, people with a physiological BMI have a significantly healthier lifestyle compared to overweight or obese people.

"""We've Always Been Kind of Kicked to the Curb"": A Mixed-Methods Assessment of Discrimination Experiences among College Students",Mahoney C.; ; Becerra B.J.; Arias D.; Romano J.E.; Becerra M.B.,"Background: Experiences of discrimination are prevalent among minority populations, although often empirical evidence does not provide depth into the source and types of discrimination, such as racial/ethnic, gender-based, age, etc. The goal of this study was to assess the unique patterns, types, and sources of discrimination experiences that college students face and explore the role these experiences play in their mental health. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study was utilized. Quantitative assessment of college students from a Hispanic and minority-serving institution was conducted to evaluate experiences of discrimination and its association to physical health and mental health (including psychological distress), as well as food insecurity, a marker for poverty. Next, qualitative data were thematically analyzed to further provide an in depth understanding on the sources of such experiences, types of discriminations, as well as the impact on mental health. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results of the quantitative assessment highlight that discrimination was prevalent among the population with a higher everyday discrimination score significantly associated with serious psychological distress, low mental health status, low physical health status, and being food insecure. Further, most of the participants reported that they felt discriminated due to their appearance, with race/ethnicity and skin color as next most commonly cited reasons. Qualitative assessment further demonstrates distinct types of discrimination experiences from a variety of sources. Within a family, colorism and having an American accent while speaking a native language was a predominant source, while among peers, having a non-American accent was a primary source of discrimination experiences. Such experiences based on elitism, gender, and age (being younger) from the workplace were prevalent among the target population. Finally, feelings of isolation, not belonging, as well as negative impact on self-efficacy and self-worth were noted. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Experiences of discrimination are prevalent among college students, including from within family and peers.

Gender Distribution of Faculty Is Strongly Correlated With Resident Gender at Canadian Radiology Residency Programs,Lawley M.; ; Dobson J.; Heelan F.; Manos D.,"Objective: Women are underrepresented in radiology overall, in radiology subspecialties, and in radiology leadership and academic positions. It is unclear why this disparity persists despite greater gender diversification in medicine. We sought to determine if a correlation exists between the proportion of female faculty at an institution, and the proportion of female residents in the associated residency program across Canada. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Faculty gender for each Canadian Diagnostic Imaging Residency Program was obtained through publicly available sources (departmental websites and provincial physician registries) in the fall of 2020. Resident gender data was obtained through a survey emailed to programs following the April 2021 CaRMS match. Data was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Research ethics approval was obtained. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Faculty information was available for 15 of the 16 Canadian radiology residency programs (94%) and resident information was obtained for 16 programs (100% response rate).

Impostor Phenomenon and Its Relationship to Self-Esteem Among Students at an International Medical College in the Middle East: A Cross Sectional Study,Naser M.J.; ; Hasan N.E.; Zainaldeen M.H.; Zaidi A.; Mohamed Y.M.A.M.H.; Fredericks S.,"The atmosphere of constant scrutiny of academic ability that prevails in medical colleges may leave some students at risk of expressing feelings of intellectual fraudulence and phoniness. Impostor phenomenon (IP) traits have been associated with anxiety, depression, job dissatisfaction, and poor professional performance. Internationally trained junior doctors exhibit stronger IP feelings than colleagues trained within their own country of citizenship. These feelings may develop during student life. International universities are diverse and complex environments where students may be emersed in a cultural milieu alien to their societies of origin, leading to feelings of isolation. Individuals with IP traits often perceive themselves as the ""only one"" experiencing this phenomenon, resulting in further isolation and negative self-evaluation, especially among women and underrepresented minorities. IP has also been linked to low self-esteem among students. This study assessed the prevalence of IP and its relationship to self-esteem among students at a campus of a European medical college with a large international student body situated in the Middle East. The self-administered questionnaires: Clance's Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were completed by 290 medical students (58.3% females). Participants' median (range) age was 19 years (16-35). Students were of 28 different nationalities; the largest proportions were from Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries. The prevalence of low self-esteem was 18.6%, while 45.2% of the students demonstrated traits suggestive of IP. There was a strongly negative correlation between CIPS and RSES (r = -0.71). No significant gender differences were found in IP. Similarly, no differences in IP were found when comparing between age groups, previous experience in higher education or year of study. Multivariate analysis showed that students from GCC countries had higher levels of self-esteem relative to students from other regions. Low self-esteem was a strong predictor of IP.

Re-defining gender diversity through an equitable and inclusive lens,Zavaletta V.; ; Allen B.J.; Parikh A.K.,"Gender diversity in radiology has centered on the societal construct of the gender binary, with significant work focused on increasing the number of women in radiology. Along with this critically important goal, it is imperative that we acknowledge gender is more expansive than a binary category because it represents a spectrum of gender identities. The discussion of this spectrum is lacking in our conversations around gender diversity and equity in radiology. Addressing equity for people of all gender identities is beneficial for us all. We define three key areas of focus: (1) improving fundamental knowledge about gender diversity and application of this knowledge in education, (2) recruiting and retaining gender-diverse physicians and (3) specific diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy to support gender-affirming environments. Improved understanding and inclusion of the full spectrum of gender in these areas will improve diversity and equity, and, in turn, enhance creativity and innovation in radiology.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2022,/,Pediatric Radiology,52,9,1743EP  - 1748,2015388931,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00247-022-05332-8,35316338,#493,Zavaletta 2022,"",""
Diversity of physicians in leadership and academic positions in Alberta: a cross-sectional survey,Ruzycki S.M.; ; Roach P.; Ahmed S.B.; Barnabe C.; Holroyd-Leduc J.,"Background Efforts to reduce barriers and disparities faced by marginalised physicians are limited by a lack of data on the current diversity of the Canadian physician workforce. We aimed to characterise the diversity of the Albertan physician workforce. Methods This cross-sectional survey, open to all Albertan physicians from 1 September 2020 to 6 October 2021, measured the proportion of physicians from traditionally under-represented groups, including those with diverse gender identities, disabilities and from racial minorities. Results There were 1087 respondents (9.3% response rate); of whom 33.4% identified as cisgender men (n=363), 46.8% as cisgender women (n=509) and less than 3% as gender diverse. Fewer than 5% were members of the LGBTQI2S+community. Half were white (n=547), 4.6% were black (n=50) and fewer than 3% were Indigenous or Latinx. Over one-third reported a disability (n=368, 33.9%). There were 303 white cisgender women (27.9%), 189 white cisgender men (17.4%), 136 black, Indigenous or person of colour (BIPOC) cisgender men (12.5%) and 151 BIPOC cisgender women (13.9%). Compared with BIPOC physicians, white participants were over-represented in leadership positions (64.2% and 32.1%; p=0.06) and academic roles (78.7% and 66.9%; p<0.01). Cisgender women had less often applied for academic promotion than cisgender men (85.4% and 78.3%, respectively, p=0.01), and BIPOC physicians had been denied promotion more frequently (7.7% compared with 4.4%; p=0.47). Conclusion Many Albertan physicians may experience marginalisation through at least one protected characteristic.

An investigation into gender bias in the evaluation of orthopedic trainee arthroscopic skills,Leape C.P.; ; Hawken J.B.; Geng X.; Wright M.A.; Murthi A.M.,"Background: Women surgeons receive lower compensation, hold fewer academic positions, and hold fewer leadership positions than men, particularly in orthopedic surgery. Gender bias at the trainee level has been demonstrated in various surgical subspecialties, but there is a lack of information on gender bias within the orthopedic training environment. This study investigated whether implicit gender bias is present in the subjective evaluation of orthopedic trainee arthroscopic skills. <ovid:br/>Method(s): After institutional review board approval, a web-based survey was sent to American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) members via the society's email listserve. Study participants were informed that the study was being done to develop a systematic evaluation method for trainees. The survey randomized participants to view and evaluate a prefellowship and a postfellowship video of ""Rachel"" (she/her) or ""Charles"" (he/him) performing a 15-point diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy. The videos for Rachel and Charles were identical except for the pronouns used in the video. Participants evaluated the trainee's skill level using questions from the Arthroscopic Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET). Blinded and deidentified additional comments regarding the trainee's skill were classified as positive, negative, or neutral. Statistical analyses were used to compare scores and comments between Rachel and Charles. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 1115 active ASES members, 181 ASES members started the survey and 106 watched both videos and were included in the analysis. Of the 106 participants completing the survey, 96 (91%) were men and 10 (9%) were women with a median (interquartile range) age of 44 (38-51). A teaching role was reported by 84 of 106 participants (79%). There was no significant difference between prefellowship scores (P = .87) or between postfellowship scores (P = .84) for the woman and man fellow. The numbers of comments classified as positive, negative, or neutral were not significantly different between the man and woman fellow (P = .19). Participants in teaching roles gave significantly lower scores to both fellows at both time points (P = .04), and participants who had fellow trainees were more likely to give negative comments to both fellows (P = .02). <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Trainee gender did not influence the ratings and comments participants gave for trainee arthroscopic skills, suggesting that gender bias may not play a major role in the evaluation of arthroscopic skill during orthopedic training.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",2022,/,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,31,11,2402EP  - 2409,2020188643,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2022.05.024,35788056,#495,Leape 2022,"",""
Diversity and perception of equity and respect in the Society of Skeletal Radiology (SSR),Bredella M.A.; ; Chung C.B.,"Purpose: To assess the perception of equity and respect in the workplace and within the SSR.

Creating Inclusive and Accessible Residency Training programs: Lessons Learned from Establishing a Deaf and American Sign Language Inclusive Model for Residency Training,Hill C.S.; ; Deville C.; Kiess A.; Narang A.K.; Ratnanather T.; Bienstock J.; Brinckerhoff L.; Hodukavich A.; Anderson R.; Alcorn S.; DeWeese T.; Viswanathan A.; Page B.R.,"Purpose: There is a growing need for a more diverse physician workforce to address gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in medicine. Investigations into vulnerable populations, including African, Native, Hispanic, and rural Americans all have overwhelmingly shown that these groups have diminished access and increased barriers to receiving radiation treatment. Increasing diversity among physicians can help address health care disparities in underserved populations. Accessible and inclusive residency training programs are needed to promote recruitment and retention of underrepresented physician groups. However, limited attention has been given to the potential benefits of training physicians with differences other than gender, race, or ethnicity. Americans with a disability represent about 27% of the population, whereas 1%-3% of physician trainees report having a disability. In 2017, our program matched a Deaf resident who preferentially utilized American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate. However, to date, there had been no published strategies on how to create an ASL inclusive residency training program for Deaf trainees. Herein, we report the development of a Deaf and ASL-inclusive residency program to serve as a model, which can be tailored to meet the needs of other underrepresented physician trainees in radiation oncology. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In preparation, department leadership engaged key stakeholders and leaders within the university's health system and among the department faculty, residents, and staff as well as the incoming resident, which led to the development and implementation of an inclusive ASL training model for the program. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In this process, 5 important principles and steps were identified. First, the trainee should be directly engaged and involved as a primary and key collaborator as to any cultural, linguistic, or physical needs and preferences. Second, key stakeholders within the institution, including hospital and department leadership, should be engaged early, and involved in implementing and creating strategies. Third, with the trainee's input, efforts should be initiated to utilize resources internal and external to the institution, including institutional ADA officers, disability services, and training consultants. Fourth, cultural and communication expectations should be discussed with faculty and staff with the goal of creating an inclusive training culture for all participants. Finally, workspace accommodations that remove any physical barriers should be addressed based on the trainee's input. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Through collaborative efforts, a Deaf and ASL-signing resident was successfully integrated into the residency program. The 5 principles of our model allow for efficient implementation of a similar framework at other institutions seeking to employ similar inclusivity initiatives.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022",2022,/,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,114,1,e8EP  - e9,2019559785,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.06.013,,#498,Hill 2022,"",""
Early Barriers to Career Progression of Women in Surgery and Solutions to Improve Them: A Systematic Scoping Review,Ferrari L.; ; Mari V.; De Santi G.; Parini S.; Capelli G.; Tacconi G.; Chessa A.; Verdi D.; Frigerio I.; Spolverato G.; Gumbs A.,"Objective: This study aims to summarize the evidence concerning the barriers that exist to the career progression of women in surgery and to provide potential solutions to overcome these obstacles. <ovid:br/>Background(s): Visible and invisible impediments can hinder female doctors' pursuit of a surgical career, from choosing a surgical specialty to training opportunities and all the way through career progression. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Database search of original studies about barriers for female surgeons during choice of surgical career, residency, and career progression. A query including possible solutions such as mentorship and network was included. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 4618 total articles; 4497 were excluded as duplicates, having incorrect study focus, or not being original studies; leaving 120 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the articles included, 22 (18%) focused on factors affecting the pursuit of a surgical career, such as surgical work hours and limited time for outside interests, 55 (46%) analyzed the main barriers that exist during surgical residency and fellowship training, such as discrimination and sexual harassment, 27 (23%) focused on barriers to career advancement, heavy workloads, ineffective mentorship, unclear expectations for advancement, inequality in pay or work-home conflicts. Among studies reporting on possible solutions, 8 (6.5%) articles reported on the role of effective mentorship to support career advancement and to provide moral support and 8 (6.5%) on the emerging role of social media for networking. Our analysis showed how different impediments hinder surgical career progression for women, with notable consequences on burnout and attrition. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Identification and recognition of obstacles to career progression is the first step to addressing the gender gap in surgery.

Gender Disparities in Neurology Research,Hall D.; ; Cahill C.; Meyer A.-C.; Peltier A.; Dy-Hollins M.; Goldman M.,"Objective: To assess gender disparities in neurology research in the United States. <ovid:br/>Background(s): The role of gender disparities in neurologists performing research is not well understood. Studies in other fields show lower publication rates and less clinical trial leadership positions in academic physician women. Studies have also shown that COVID impacted women physicians differently (worse) than men. The purpose of this project was to study gender disparities perceived by researchers in neurology in the US as reported by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) survey respondents in 2020. Design/Methods: A 34-question survey was distributed to 4,644 US-based American Academy of Neurology members who self-identified as researchers in 2020 addressing the following domains: research and funding, scholarly activities, COVID-19 impact, and local institutional climate. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 700 (15%) (women, n=231; men, n=426) completed the survey, with 71% White and >80% conducting research. Women respondents were significantly younger than men and more likely to be assistant professors (32% vs 21%). Compared to men, women received equivalent grants/research support and had comparable formal research training and mentorship. Women had less middle author publications (mean 5.8 [SD 9.2] vs mean 8.2 [SD 11.8], p=0.03) compared to men. A lower proportion of women presented research at grand rounds or at a national/international conference compared to men (58% vs 69%, p=0.01). Women spent more time in non-professional responsibilities, were less satisfied with their work/life balance and were less likely to agree with statements addressing equity/diversity and institutional climate. A higher proportion of women reported that family responsibilities during COVID affected research activities and lead to delayed submission of non-COVID related manuscripts. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our survey of U.S. based neurology researchers demonstrated gender-based disparities in multiple areas of academic neurology.

"Examining intersectionality in anesthesiology training, academics, and practice",Gouger D.H.; ; Sankaran Raval M.; Hussain R.S.; Bastien A.,"Purpose of reviewIntersectionality, or the overlapping nature of social categorizations, such as race, class, and gender, creates interdependent systems of discrimination, disadvantage, and health disparities. The present review examines common shortcomings to diversity management, and proposes targeted improvement frameworks for anesthesiology departments that would offer competitive advantage in training, hiring, and retention, and improved care delivery aimed toward reducing health disparities.Recent findingsStudies highlight that physicians equipped to care for diverse populations enhance patient-doctor interactions and reduce health disparities. Moreover, untrained providers and staff who engage in disrespectful behaviors like microaggressions can lead to staff turnover and millions of dollars in lost revenue. Underrepresented minorities continue to have lower faculty academic rank in anesthesiology, fewer partnership opportunities in private practice, and disparate research funding. Diversity-based education and training often overlooks intersectionality and reductively illustrates diverse groups as internally homogenous. Even these developing diversity efforts have become politicized and are perceived as uninteresting, irrelevant to medical practice, or unable to create organizational change.SummaryThe synergy of intersectionality mounts considerable challenges that impact patients, colleagues, and communities of practice. Examining intersectionality in education and workplace policy affords tremendous opportunity for improving quality of care for marginalized populations, reducing healthcare costs, and normalizing culture that is inclusive, equitable, and empowering.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment in a Department of Pediatrics,Slater A.C.; ; Thomas A.A.; Quan L.; Bell S.; Bradford M.C.; Walker-Harding L.; Rosenberg A.R.,"The last substantial description of gender discrimination and harassment described in the journal Pediatrics was in 2019. It is unclear whether the field has made progress toward its goal of equity. We aimed to describe: (1) the recent gender-equity climate according to women and men faculty in the department of pediatrics at a single, large academic center, and (2) institutional efforts to address persistent gender discrimination and harassment. In late 2020, we distributed an anonymous survey to all department faculty that included demographic data, a modified version of the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work Scale, questions about experiences/ witnessed discriminatory treatment and sexual harassment, and if those experiences negatively affected career advancement. Of 524 pediatrics faculty, 290 (55%) responded. Compared with men, women more commonly reported gender discrimination (50% vs. 4%, P < .01) and that their gender negatively affected their career advancement (50% vs 9%, P < .01). More than 50% of women reported discriminatory treatment at least annually and 38% recognized specific sexist statements; only 4% and 17% of men reported the same (P < .01 for both). We concluded that a disproportionately low number of male faculty recognized the harassment female faculty experienced. In the 18 months since, our department and university have made efforts to improve salary equity and parity in leadership representation, created an anonymous bias-reporting portal, mandated bias training, and implemented new benchmarks of ""professionalism"" that focus on diversity. Although we acknowledge that culture change will take time, we hope our lessons learned help promote gender equity in pediatrics more broadly.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",2022,/,Pediatrics,150,6,e2021055933,2028641160,https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/PEDS.2021-055933,36412054,#502,Slater 2022,"",""
"GENDER DIVERSITY AMONG EDITORIAL BOARDS OF NEONATAL, PERINATAL, PEDIATRIC, AND MATERNALFETAL MEDICINE JOURNALS",Sakaria S.; ; Kushnir A.,"Purpose of Study Historically, women have been underrepresented in medicine compared to the general population. Throughout the years, their representation in medical school has significantly increased. While gender diversity in medicine is slowly increasing, this does not necessarily correlate to gender inclusion. There are many areas within the medical field in which inequities exist, particularly regarding career advancements, including holding positions on leadership boards, including journal editorial boards. This type of gender disparity could reflect a lack of equity for women in the field of Neonatology, Perinatology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and Pediatrics. This can impact career progression in both academic and clinical settings and promote gender based discrimination in the workplace. Women physicians are increasing in number, with many candidates holding titles of associate professors and professors. While women may face more societal pressures on balancing personal life and career, it should not have any impact on their representation in leadership positions. However, there is research showing delay in career advancement and fewer women in higher ranking positions compared to their male counterparts. Our objective is to quantify gender representation among editorial boards of neonatal/perinatal/pediatric journals and examine gender inequities. Methods Used An analysis of 50 editorial boards of Neonatal, Perinatal, Pediatric, and Maternal-fetal medicine journals from across the world. Evaluation of the editorial boards included documenting the difference in genders among the editors-in chief, deputy editors, executive editors, associate editors, and section editors of the published journals. Summary of Results Of the 50 editors-in chief, 22% were women, only 2 executive editors were noted, both of whom were men. Women composed 39% of the 23 associate editors. Of the 9 journal boards that included a deputy editor, 4 (44%) of them had a women holding that position, while of the 21 journals which included a section editor, 29% were women. From all 50 journals, the executive boards composed a total of 1,338 editors, with 439 (33%) of them being women and 899 (67%) being men. Conclusions The current data shows that women hold the minority of editorial positions compared to men. Future direction in the field should emphasize a push towards more equal representation of men and women on editorial boards and in positions of leadership overall. This can decrease bias and discrimination in the workplace, while also lessening the gender gap in the workforce.

Factors that influence the implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in healthcare leadership: A meta-ethnographic study,Mousa M.; ; Skouteris H.; Boyle J.A.; Currie G.; Riach K.; Teede H.J.,"Background: Gender inequity in healthcare leadership persists and progress is slow, with the focus firmly on problems, barriers and on requiring women themselves to adapt and compete in a system not designed for them. Women are individually burdened to advance their careers, with little effort given to addressing systemic barriers in the health sector. A recent systematic review prioritised organisational-level approaches and demonstrated effective interventions. In this meta-ethnographic study, we further this work by examining factors in implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in leadership. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The meta-ethnographic framework applied here follows the Noblit and Hare approach for synthesising findings and applying interpretive analysis to original research. We generated a new line-of-argument with insights for the healthcare sector. The protocol is registered (CRD42020162115) on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Three academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS) were searched systematically between 2000 and 2021. Studies were analysed if they included organisational-level interventions that sought to measurably advance women in leadership. Study characteristics were extracted using a standard template for intervention details. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. Data synthesis was conducted across 19 criteria of the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guide (eMERGe). <ovid:br/>Finding(s): Fifteen qualitative studies were included. Analysis revealed three meta-themes that are central to successful implementation of organisational interventions that advance women in healthcare leadership: (1) leadership commitment and accountability, influenced by internal and external organisational settings, salient for long term outcomes and for developing an inclusive leadership culture; (2) intervention fit with individuals with consideration given to personal beliefs, preferences, experiences, capabilities or life circumstances, including capacity for leadership roles in their broader life context; balanced against maintaining interventional fidelity, and (3) cultural climate and organisational readiness for change, addressing traditional, conservative and constrictive perspectives on gender and leadership in health, highlighting the facilitating role of male colleagues. <ovid:br/>Interpretation(s): This meta-ethnographic research extends past work by integrating empirical evidence from a systematic literature review of effective organisational level interventions, with the identification of pragmatic themes to generate, implement, evaluate and embed evidence-based organisational interventions to advance women in healthcare leadership. This work can inform initiatives and policymakers to generate and implement new knowledge to advance women in healthcare leadership. <ovid:br/>Funding(s): Epworth Health and Monash University provided scholarships for MM.

Over the past several years, institutional DEI initiatives have led to increases in the numbers of underrepresented trainees and faculty at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and Yale Cancer Center (YCC). In 2021, the Yale Hematology/Oncology (HO) Fellowship Program created a DEI curriculum for Yale HO Fellows, designed by the HO Chief Fellows with guidance from Fellowship Program Leadership and the Vice Chair of DEI for YCC. The goals of the DEI curriculum were to foster a programmatic culture of inclusion and empower fellows to identify and respond to discrimination events in the workplace. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A baseline needs-based assessment was performed with online anonymized surveys. The six-question survey was designed to assess topic preferences and witnessed discrimination events; all HO fellows (n = 27) were emailed a link to the survey. Based on the needs assessment, a five part DEI curriculum was designed, which included 1) an interactive session with the Vice Chair of DEI, 2) a journal club with the Deputy Dean and Chief Diversity Officer at YSM, 3) an interactive session on advancing gender equity through allyship and awareness led by external consultants, 4) an interactive session on gender identity with two experts on LGBTQIA2S+ issues in medicine following a YCC Grand Rounds seminar, and 5) a Chief Fellow-led interactive session on upstander training. The DEI curriculum was mandatory for all fellows. Evaluations of the curriculum at its completion were collected via a separate online anonymous survey that included 11 questions about comfort level in addressing discrimination and harassment (Kirkpatrick level 2). Perceptions of DEI among HO fellows and Core Faculty were further gauged using annual trainee and faculty surveys distributed by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 2021 and 2022, and a separate survey designed and distributed by the Program Leadership to gauge perceptions of DEI among HO Core Faculty in 2021 and 2022. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): In total, 17 fellows (68%) responded to the pre-curriculum needs assessment survey. The majority of respondents witnessed (>75%) or experienced (>64%) some form of harassment during medical training. All respondents reported being under-equipped to navigate these scenarios. Inclusion of DEI into the fellowship curriculum was perceived as very important (mean 8.19/10, range 2-10). All fellows completed the five-part DEI curriculum. A total of 8 fellows (32%) responded to the post-curriculum survey; respondents reported an increase in comfort level navigating discrimination events (Figure 1). In ACGME trainee and faculty surveys prior to (2021) and following (2022) initiation of the DEI curriculum, compliance with DEI efforts increased above national means after initiation of the DEI curriculum (2021 mean scores, HO fellowship program vs national: faculty, 4.6 vs 4.4, fellows 4.2 vs 4.3; 2022: faculty 4.8 vs 4.5, fellows 4.6 vs 4.3). In surveys prior to and following the institution of the DEI, the percentages of HO Core Faculty who agreed that the HO Fellowship Program treats DEI as being core to its mission, on par with clinical excellence and investigative pursuits, increased from 71.4% to 80%. Those who agreed that DEI topics are formally or informally discussed as part of the educational experience of HO fellows increased from 28.5% to 50%. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): A DEI curriculum for HO fellows may lead to significant improvements in fellow upstander responses to discrimination in the workplace and may augment institutional perceptions of DEI among fellows and faculty. We plan to continue our fellow-led DEI curriculum in perpetuity as part of our fellowship program and institution's commitment to DEI efforts.

Access to mentors, representation and exposure to EM affected interest. Table 1. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The EM gender differential is affected by societal gender roles and an environment that rewards traditional masculine traits. Conflict with behavioral norms may hinder women forming their professional identity as an emergency physician.

Exploring perceptions of gender bias in oncology: A survey study,Balanchivadze N.; ; Mckay C.; Nasser Z.; Passalacqua K.D.; Li P.; Chino F.; Duma N.,"Background: Gender inequalities contribute to burnout and have contributed to an ongoing exodus of women from academic oncology. Our aim was to explore the perceptions and experiences of oncology professionals regarding gender bias in the workplace with the hope of providing critical information to support equity initiatives. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An anonymous, 22-question survey was sent via Survey Monkey to 1512 physicians with oncology-related specialties from National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer centers whose emails were publicly available. Likert-scale questions (never-rarely-sometimesoften- very often) were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (percentages shown as frequency of having responded ""sometimes-often-very often""). Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 274 physicians completed the survey (response rate 18%): 152 (55.5%) self-identified as female (F); 112 (42%) as male (M); 7 (2.6%) as gender non-conforming or transgender; 3 (1.1%) chose not to answer. Most were White (59.9%), followed by Asian (20.4%), Middle Eastern (5.8 %), Multiracial (5.1%), Hispanic (3.6%), and Black (1.5%). The plurality (n = 103; 37.6%) were < 40 years old. Primary fields of practice included 118 (43.1%) in adult oncology, 45 (16.4%) in combined hematology/oncology, 44 (16.1%) in radiation oncology, 44 (16.1%) in adult hematology, and 23 (8.4%) in other specialties. Female gender was associated with experiencing gender bias more often than male gender in the following areas: clinical practice (80.9% F vs 20.6% M), research activities (73.0% F vs 15.2% M), having difficulty balancing work and non-work responsibilities (95.4% F vs 78.6% M), being held to higher standards compared to physicians of other genders (73.1% F vs 14.2% M), being mistaken as a non-physician (78.9% F vs 6.3% M), and being scrutinized by others while tending to childcare needs (48.8% F vs 23.2% M) (all p <.001). Female gender was associated with using techniques to navigate gender challenges more often than male gender, including wearing a white coat (55% F vs 7% M; p <.001), ensuring that ""Doctor"" is written on identification (33% F vs 3% M; p =.002), emphasizing a professional look (53% F vs 10% M; p =.003) and working harder to establish expertise in the field (72% F vs 18% M; p =.003). When asked about strategies to address workplace gender-related bias, 63% would like policies on gender-related discrimination, (66.4% F vs 65.2% M; p =.93), 62% would like policies that prioritize leadership representation (74.3% F vs 51.8% M; p <.001), and relatively few (37%) would prefer formal lectures/instruction for staff (38.2% F vs 37.5% M; p >.99). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Self-identified female academic oncologists at NCI Cancer Centers reported facing gender-related challenges in daily practice at much higher rates than men.

Gender Diversity in Editorial Boards of Neonatal Journals,Sakaria S.; ; Kushnir A.,"Background: Historically, women have been underrepresented in medicine compared to the general population. Throughout the years, their representation in medical school has significantly increased. While gender diversity in medicine is slowly increasing, this does not necessarily correlate to gender inclusion. There are many areas within the medical field in which inequities exist, particularly regarding career advancements, including holding positions on leadership boards, including journal editorial boards. This type of gender disparity could reflect a lack of equity for women in the field of Neonatology, Perinatology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and Pediatrics. This can impact career progression in both academic and clinical settings and promote gender based discrimination in the workplace. Women physicians are increasing in number, with many candidates holding titles of associate professors and professors. While women may face more societal pressures on balancing personal life and career, it should not have any impact on their representation in leadership positions. However, there is research showing delay in career advancement and fewer women in higher ranking positions compared to their male counterparts. Our objective is to quantify gender representation among editorial boards of neonatal/perinatal/pediatric journals and examine gender inequities. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An analysis of 50 editorial boards of Neonatal, Perinatal, Pediatric, and Maternalfetal medicine journals from across the world. Evaluation of the editorial boards included documenting the difference in genders among the editors-in chief, deputy editors, executive editors, associate editors, and section editors of the published journals. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 50 editors-in chief, 22% were women and only 2 executive editors were noted, both of whom were men. Women composed 39% of the 23 associate editors. Of the 9 journal boards that included a deputy editor, 4 (44%) of them had a women holding that position, while of the 21 journals which included a section editor, 29% were women. From all 50 journals, the executive boards composed a total of 1,338 editors, with 439 (33%) of them being women and 899 (67%) being men. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The current data shows that women hold the minority of editorial positions compared to men. Future direction in the field should emphasize a push towards more equal representation of men and women on editorial boards and in positions of leadership overall. This can decrease bias and discrimination in the workplace, while also lessening the gender gap in the workforce.",2022,/,Pediatrics,149,,,638786533,,,#509,Sakaria 2022,"",""
Transcare: A Knowledge-to-Action Project for Gender and Equity Education in Surgery,Woods A.L.; ; Raskin E.R.; Keller D.S.,"INTRODUCTION: The transgender/nonbinary (TGNB) population is growing exponentially, and patients face discrimination and barriers to healthcare access. There is a need to improve communication and make their healthcare environment more inclusive. We sought to assess the understanding, awareness, and comfort treating TGNB patients. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A 4-domain survey (personal perceptions, previous healthcare training/experience, comfort providing care, barriers to access) for TGNB patients was sent to all faculty and trainees in a single urban surgery department. The survey was based on the validated Mayo Alix instrument, with 24 5-point Likert items and 6 multiple choice demographic questions. The link was sent electronically, with a 4-week study period. Distribution statistics assessed the relative frequency of responses. Main outcome measures were the gaps and variation in each domain. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There was a 47.6% participation rate; respondents were split evenly between trainees and attendings. Most experienced caring for TGNB patients (74.7%). There was disparities understanding general concepts; over 1/3 disagreed on definitions and considered TGNB a choice. Most could initiate pronoun (75.6%) and gender identity (71.7%) conversations. But almost half could not complete a comprehensive history and all admitted discomfort performing physical exams. Somehow, 88.5% felt they could provide the same level of care. The majority recognized TGNB patients have unique health risks (91.86%) and providers lack cultural competency, which was a barrier to care (82.76%), (Fig.1). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Disparities exist across all domains needed for an inclusive environment.

Impact of Gender-Affirming Care Learning Module on Medical Students' Knowledge and Self-Efficacy,Mokatrin M.R.; ; Joshi W.; Patterson M.; Marinkovic M.,"While evidence supports the need for increased provider education on gender-affirming care, few medical curricula address the healthcare needs of transgender and non-binary (TGNB) patients. To bridge this knowledge gap, we developed an online learning module to educate medical students (MS) in the care of this underserved population. The module included topics such as TGNB health disparities, gender dysphoria, and gender-affirming therapy. We hypothesized that learners would possess greater knowledge and self-efficacy following completion of the module. A cohort of 272 first- (MS1) and second-year medical students (MS2) from a single institution received protected time during their academic training to complete the mandatory online module (total duration: 60 minutes). Of those, 90 learners consented to participate in our IRB approved study and completed pre- and post-module surveys. Surveys assessed the impact of the educational module on self-reported knowledge and self-efficacy pertaining to learning objectives. Most participants self-identified as cisgender (97%), while 40% of those who chose to answer reported being part of LGBTQIA+ community. Baseline knowledge scores ranged from 7 (not knowledgeable) to 35 (knowledgeable). Following completion of the module, the median knowledge score significantly increased by 9 points (23 to 32; p<0.0001). At baseline, self-efficacy scores ranged from 9 (not confident) to 45 (confident) and similarly increased by 9 points (31 to 40; p<0.0001). Feedback from participants indicated that the module was well-received. Our data showed that an online educational module on gender-affirming care was successful in increasing knowledge and self-efficacy in surveyed MS1 and MS2 at our institution. Education of healthcare providers is a key step towards improving care for TGNB patients. Therefore, more institutions should adopt formal curricula for MS on gender-affirming care to mitigate health disparities in this vulnerable population.

NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES OF U.S. FEMALE UROLOGY RESIDENTS,Sheng M.; ; Catic A.; Patil D.; Hartsell L.; Mehta A.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Urology remains a disproportionately male-physician dominated field, with women physicians comprising only 10% of all practicing urologists and 27% of current urology residents. Understanding the needs and experiences of women residents is essential for developing strategies to recruit and retain more women urologists in independent practice. The primary objective of this study was to identify factors influencing residency training program selection by women residents in urology. The secondary objective was to evaluate the residents' gender-based experiences during training. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): An anonymous, 15-item web-based electronic survey was distributed between May-July 2021, targeted to all 461 current women U.S. urology residents. Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and thematic analysis, respectively. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 147 complete responses were received from women residents representing each of the 8 AUA sections. When asked to rank a series of factors influencing their decision about residency training program selection, 37% of respondents chose geographic location/setting as the most important factor, followed by 27% who selected institutional reputation. Surprisingly, only 3.4% ranked number of women faculty and 0% ranked number of women residents as most important factor in their decision. When asked how their current programs can better foster clinical and academic growth of women residents, the most common responses were increased presence of women faculty and mentorship (36%), increased awareness and elimination of gender bias/harassment in the workplace (33%), and improved family support/maternity leave policies (15%). Regarding challenges in the workplace, 73.5% of respondents reported experiencing stereotyping of women doctors and 18% reported experiencing problems with maternity leave.

The Role of Gender in Careers in Medicine: a Systematic Review and Thematic Synthesis of Qualitative Literature,Winkel A.F.; ; Telzak B.; Shaw J.; Hollond C.; Magro J.; Nicholson J.; Quinn G.,"Abstract: Background: Gender disparities exist in the careers of women in medicine. This review explores the qualitative literature to understand how gender influences professional trajectories, and identify opportunities for intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A systematic review and thematic synthesis included articles obtained from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), APA PsycInfo (Ovid), and GenderWatch (ProQuest) on June 26 2020, updated on September 10, 2020. Included studies explored specialty choice, leadership roles, practice setting, burnout, promotion, stigma, mentoring, and organizational culture. Studies taking place outside of the USA, using only quantitative data, conducted prior to 2000, or focused on other health professions were excluded. Data were extracted using a standardized extraction tool and assessed for rigor and quality using a 9-item appraisal tool.

The gender pay gap in medicine: A systematic review,Hoff T.; ; Lee D.R.,"BACKGROUND: Women are becoming doctors in greater numbers. Despite this, there is evidence of female doctors' continued differential treatment compared to their male counterparts. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review systematically the extant literature on the gender-based pay gap in medicine across time, different medical specialties, and different countries of clinical practice. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Systematic search of three databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies needed to be empirical and contain either an unadjusted or adjusted gender-based finding related to pay. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): A total of 46 articles published since 2000 contained a gender-based finding related to physician pay. Thirty-two of these 46 articles presented either adjusted or unadjusted means comparisons (or both) comparing pay between male and female physicians. Eighteen of the 46 articles controlled for one or more variables in examining pay between the two groups. Across almost all studies, female doctors earn significantly less than men, often tens of thousands of dollars less annually, despite similar demographic and work-related profiles. This earnings gap is persistent across time, medical specialty, and country of practice. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The gender-based pay gap is an ongoing crisis within medicine that must be addressed. From a practice perspective, women physicians may benefit from greater organizational awareness of potential workplace bias and the implementation of more supportive policies aimed at better equalizing compensation through greater support and transparency related to salary negotiations, promotional opportunities, and pay scales across various job titles.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A Report of Gender Bias and Sexual Harassment in Current Plastic Surgery Training: A National Survey,Chen W.; ; Schilling B.K.; Bourne D.A.; Myers S.; De La Cruz C.,"BACKGROUND: Gender bias and sexual misconduct continue to pervade medicine. The authors hypothesize that gender bias and sexual misconduct disproportionately and negatively affect female plastic surgery trainees. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A national survey of plastic surgery trainees (2018 to 2019) was conducted using previously validated sexual harassment surveys adapted for relevance to plastic surgery. Respondents were queried about experiences with workplace gender bias and harassment; personal and professional impact; and reporting practices. Analyses included chi-square, logistic regression, and analysis of variance. Significance was accepted for values of p < 0.05. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 236 responses (115 female respondents; 20.1 percent response rate). Most respondents were Caucasian (Asian/Pacific Islander, n = 34) residents (n = 123). The feeling of hindrance to career advancement was greater for women, by 10-fold (p < 0.001), and increased with age (p = 0.046). Women felt uncomfortable challenging attitudes regarding gender inequality (p < 0.001), regardless of training levels (p = 0.670) or race (p = 0.300). Gender bias diminished female trainees' career goals/ambition (p < 0.001). Women were more likely to experience sexual harassment, in the form of jokes (p = 0.003) and comments about their body or sexuality (p = 0.014). Respondents reported the majority of perpetrators of harassment to be attending physicians (30 percent) and other trainees (37 percent). Most common reasons to not report incidents included ""futility"" (29 percent) and ""fear"" (20 percent). Women experienced at least three symptoms of depression/anxiety, significantly higher than men (p = 0.001). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Gender bias and sexual misconduct negatively affect female trainees' attitudes toward their career. Two-thirds of cases of sexual harassment originate from other physicians. Minority trainees are less prepared to address transgressions and more likely to experience sexual coercion. Trainees perceive a culture nonconducive to reporting.

Gender-Based Pay Discrimination in Otolaryngology,Lindsay R.; ,"Male and female otolaryngologists all attend the same accredited medical schools, complete the same accredited residency programs, and take the same board certification exams; however, female otolaryngologist are paid 77 cents on the dollar compared to their male colleagues. Even after accounting for age, experience, faculty rank, research productivity, and clinical revenue, significant gender pay gaps exist across all professor levels. The goal of this review is to improve our understanding of how and why the gender pay gap and discrimination exists, the harm caused by tolerance of policies that perpetuate gender pay inequity, and what is and can be done to correct gender-based pay gaps and discrimination. The review presents the current status of gender pay inequity in the United States and reports on how otolaryngology compares to other professions both within and outside of healthcare. The gender pay gap is shown to have a negative impact on economic growth, institutional reputation and financial success, retention and recruitment of faculty, and patient care. Many historically incorrect reasons used to explain the causes of the gender pay gap, including that women work less, have less research productivity, or produce lower-quality care, have been be disproved by evaluation of current research.

"The wage gap in the PA profession: Historical context, contributing factors, and solutions",Marvel S.S.; ,"ABSTRACT: The wage gap between men and women in the physician assistant (PA) profession has followed the evolution of trends and cultural shifts in both medicine and the broader US workforce. Although the gap has narrowed both nationally and, more specifically, within the PA profession, female PAs make on average $11,000 (or 6%) less than their male counterparts. The rate at which the wage gap is closing in the United States has slowed indicating that the remaining causes of the problem are subtle and difficult to address. This article discusses contributing factors such as implicit bias, workplace culture, modern family structure in the context of outdated expectations, female PA self-undervaluing, and weak consequences for violation of existing labor laws. Solutions may include legislation to further protect and empower women in the workplace, campaigns from PA professional organizations that can influence the profession's cultural landscape and empower PAs to know their worth, PA educators including contract negotiation as part of the curriculum, and employers addressing systemic hiring processes that undervalue female PAs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 American Academy of Physician Assistants.",2021,/,JAAPA : official journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants,34,3,49EP  - 52,634344859,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.JAA.0000733252.82666.2b,33600111,#521,Marvel 2021,"",""
Established evidence-based treatment guidelines help mitigate disparities in quality of emergency care,Trent S.A.; ; George N.; Havranek E.P.; Ginde A.A.; Haukoos J.S.,"Background: Evidence-based guidelines are often cited as a means of ensuring high-quality care for all patients. Our objective was to assess whether emergency department (ED) adherence to core evidence-based guidelines differed by patient sex and race/ethnicity and to assess the effect of ED guideline adherence on patient outcomes by sex and race/ethnicity. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a preplanned secondary analysis of data from a multicenter retrospective observational study evaluating variation in ED adherence to five core evidence-based treatment guidelines including aspirin for acute coronary syndrome, door-to-balloon time for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, systemic thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke, antibiotic selection for inpatient pneumonia, and early management of severe sepsis/septic shock. This study was performed at six hospitals in Colorado with heterogeneous and diverse practice environments. Hierarchical generalized linear modeling was used to estimate adjusted associations between ED adherence and patient sex and race/ethnicity while controlling for other patient, physician, and environmental factors that could confound this association. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 1,880 patients were included in the study with a median (IQR) age of 62 (51-74) years. Males and non-Hispanic whites comprised 59% and 71% of the cohort, respectively. While unadjusted differences were identified, our adjusted analyses found no significant association between ED guideline adherence and sex or race/ethnicity. Patients who did not receive guideline adherent care in the ED were significantly more likely to die while in the hospital (odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 3.2). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Longstanding, nationally reported evidence-based guidelines can help eliminate sex and race/ethnicity disparities in quality of care. When providers know their care is being monitored and reported, their implicit biases may be less likely to impact care.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",2021,/,Academic Emergency Medicine,28,9,1051EP  - 1060,2013002038,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acem.14235,33599040,#522,Trent 2021,"",""
Influential Factors of Non-suicidal Self-Injury in an Eastern Cultural Context: A Qualitative Study From the Perspective of School Mental Health Professionals,Chen X.; ; Zhou Y.; Li L.; Hou Y.; Liu D.; Yang X.; Zhang X.,"Background: Adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is becoming a serious public health concern worldwide. In recent years, there has seen a significant increase in both the growth rate and cases of NSSI in Eastern countries, such as Japan, India, and China. In China, most schools have a mental health office that comprises mental health professionals (MHPs), who are the first to respond to student mental health problems, which include NSSI. MHPs possess comprehensive knowledge as well as unique insight into adolescent NSSI. However, very few studies on NSSI have incorporated their perspectives. In this work, we seek to add novel insight by conducting a study focusing on adolescent NSSI from the perspective of MHPs. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited a total of 24 MHPs from different schools using purposive sampling and conducted a semi-structured interview on NSSI-related issues. Each interview was voice recorded and lasted ~30 min. A thematic analysis was performed for the responses to study the most common and concerning issues underlying NSSI. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We extracted three major themes and eight sub-themes from the interview records, which included (1) the impact of Chinese culture on NSSI (sex-bias discrimination, overly high expectations, and inappropriate parenting style); (2) life events in school (internet use, academic pressure, and romantic relationships); and (3) opinions on the status quo of NSSI in China (ignorance and stigma). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Results showed that culturally sensitive influential factors, such as sex-bias discrimination, the imposing of unrealistic expectations for personal achievement, and inappropriate parenting style, should be given more attention to prevent, assess, and intervene in NSSI. Emerging factors of modern society and adolescent lifestyles, such as academic pressure, internet use, and romantic relationships, should also be considered for treatments.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Chen, Zhou, Li, Hou, Liu, Yang and Zhang.",2021,/,Frontiers in Psychiatry,12,"(Chen, Zhou, Yang, Zhang) Department of Psychology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China(Li) Huangpu School, Shenzhen, China(Hou) Department of Humanities and Mental Nursing, School of Nursing, Southern Medical University",681985,636193213,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.681985,,#523,Chen 2021,"",""
An Exploration of Gender Bias Affecting Women in Medicine,Hefner J.L.; ; Nembhard I.M.; Stephenson A.L.; Diehl A.B.; Dzubinski L.M.; McErlean M.; Huppertz J.; Sidhu M.,"Women in medicine face barriers that hinder progress toward top leadership roles, and the industry remains plagued by the grand challenge of gender inequality. The purpose of this study was to explore how subtle and overt gender biases affect women physicians, physician leaders, researchers, and faculty working in academic health sciences environments and to further examine the association of these biases with workplace satisfaction. The study used a convergent mixed methods approach. Sampling from a list of medical schools in the United States, in conjunction with a list of each state's medical society, the authors analyzed the quantitative survey responses of 293 women in medicine. The authors conducted ordinary least squares multiple regression to assess the relationship of gender barriers on workplace satisfaction. Additionally, 132 of the 293 participants provided written open-ended responses that were explored using a qualitative content analysis methodology. The survey results showed that male culture, lack of sponsorship, lack of mentoring, and queen bee syndrome were associated with lower workplace satisfaction. The qualitative results provided illustrations of how participants experienced these biases. These results emphasize the obstacles that women face and highlight the detrimental nature of gender bias in medicine.

The Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities among Integrated Plastic Surgery Trainees: A Persistent Need for Diversification,Dekhou A.; ; Jahshan A.; Aoun M.; Folbe A.,"Background: Diversity in the workplace is crucial. As the United States population continues to diversify, the composition of graduate medical trainees (GMTs) among various medical specialties is not diversifying at nearly the same rate. This study aims to identify gender and ethnic minority disparities present in medicine, specifically among GMTs in the field of plastic surgery. <ovid:br/>Purpose(s): The field of plastic surgery is vast, with the patient population ranging from newborns to elders of all different races, religions, and ethnicities. However, the representation of women and minorities among the current plastic surgery trainees is not equivalent to the population they serve. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data from the Graduate Medical Education (GME) census published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) was analyzed to compare trends of female and underrepresented ethnic minorities over the academic period from 2015 through 2019. Data regarding all GMTs and specifically those in the integrated plastic surgery (IPS) program was collected. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Over the five-year study period, females were consistently underrepresented in plastic surgery when compared to the total number of female medical trainees. Currently, females represent 42.7% of GMTs in IPS, a small increase from 40.9% in 2015. Furthermore, Whites and Asians encompassed 87.7% (65.6% and 22.1%, respectively) of plastic surgery GMTs in 2019-2020. In the same academic year, Blacks and Hispanics together made up only 9.1% (2.5% and 6.6%, respectively) of GMTs in plastic surgery. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study portrays the importance of highlighting gender and ethnic minority disparities in the field of plastic surgery, thereby promoting initiatives for change in the coming future.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 National Medical Association",2021,/,Journal of the National Medical Association,113,5,576EP  - 579,2012895880,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.05.002,34112525,#525,Dekhou 2021,"",""
The multicultural personality questionnaire (Sf-40): Adaptation and validation of the Spanish version,Summerfield L.P.; ; Prado-Gasco V.; Gimenez-Espert M.C.; Mesa-Gresa P.,"The coexistence of diverse cultures in our society indicates the need to examine the factors related to the success of multicultural interactions. The study aims were to examine the psychometric characteristics of the Spanish version of the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire short form (MPQ-SF40), in a convenience sample of 392 university students. Then, the effect of sex and age was assessed, and finally, the levels and percentiles of multicultural personality were measured. The scale's validity was assessed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA). Reliability was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). The final structure of the MPQ-SF40 consisted of 18 items grouped into five factors that present adequate psychometric properties. Sex-specific differences in MPQ-SF40 were statistically significant for factor 1, cultural empathy, and for factor 5, flexibility; women showed greater values. When age was analyzed, significant low correlations were obtained. The students showed medium to high levels of multicultural personality. The highest levels correspond to the personality factors of cultural empathy and open-mindedness. The use of the Spanish version of the MPQ-SF40 seems justified to determine students' multicultural personality traits, developing intervention programs to improve social support and the interpersonal relations between students.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the authors.

Association between selected individual and environmental characteristics in relation to health behavior of Brazilian adolescents,Haddad M.R.; ; Sarti F.M.; Nishijima M.,"Objective: The study investigates the evolution of healthy behaviors (healthy eating and regular physical activity) in Brazilian adolescents during 2012 and 2015, and its associations with self-assessment of body weight and adoption of weight control attitudes, in the context of diverse household features, school environments, and regional characteristics. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Two cross-sectional surveys of Brazilian adolescents attending the ninth grade in 2012 and 2015 were gathered comprising a national sample. Data from 209,601 completed surveys were analyzed using robust error estimates of ordinary least squares regressions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results showed that there was a decrease in the frequency of healthy foods consumption and recommended physical activity level between 2012 and 2015. The regression analyses revealed that healthy eating and physical activity were significantly higher for adolescents with normal weight perception (i.e., did not perceive themselves to have either low or excess body weight) and for adolescents who were male, were members of middle socioeconomic stratum families, and had mothers with college degrees. In addition, healthy eating was significantly higher for adolescents who did not wish to lose weight, did not watch TV while eating, went to public schools, and lived with both parents. Ethnic differences varied based on region, with healthy eating being significantly higher among black/mulato/indigenous adolescents in the South and Southeast regions, but significantly higher among white/yellow adolescents in the North region. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Ethnic and gender-related differences were identified in health behaviors and attitudes towards weight control of Brazilian adolescents.

Each program's website was searched for a current resident roster. Data of geography, number of female faculty, number of female physicians in leadership positions, program setting, and program size were obtained. Statistical comparison of these factors with number of female residents was performed with P <.05 as significant. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There was a significant association between programs having a higher-than-average female faculty representation and a greater representation of female residents (P <.001).

Moral determinants of health: An overview of disparities in healthcare,Dissanaike S.; ; Matthews J.B.,"Healthcare disparities are a serious problem that shorten the lives of many Americans, even after accounting for social, cultural, and economic factors and correcting for confounders such as the lack of medical insurance and access to healthcare, black Americans and other minority groups receive worse medical care and experience worse outcomes as a result. Healthcare does not occur in a vacuum; surgeons cannot serve our patients' needs isolated in a bubble and cocooned from larger societal concerns. Although disparities rooted in race likely have the greatest negative effects on our patients' health, plenty of groups exist that have not historically received equal opportunities and acceptance within the surgical world. Despite now accounting for more than one half of all medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions, and the gender pay gap has remained significant in all branches of medicine. It will require active, multifaceted, and sustained effort to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery.

Contributors to Gender Differences in Burnout and Professional Fulfillment: A Survey of Physician Faculty,Rotenstein L.; ; Harry E.; Wickner P.; Gupte A.; Neville B.A.; Lipsitz S.; Cullen E.; Rozenblum R.; Sequist T.D.; Dudley J.,"Background: This study was conducted to describe gender differences in physician burnout and professional fulfillment and to explore their potential contributors. <ovid:br/>Method(s): This was a single-center, cross-sectional survey study of physician faculty at Brigham and Women's Hospital, an academic medical center in Boston. The population included all physician faculty who practiced clinical medicine in 2017 (n = 2,388). The study was conducted using the Stanford Physician Wellness Survey. Burnout and professional fulfillment were the main outcome measures assessed. Other variables assessed included ratings of culture of wellness, personal resilience, and efficiency of practice factors associated with physician experience. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The study population consisted of 1,066 faculty, of whom 46.4% were female and 59.8% were younger than 50. Female physicians reported significantly higher rates of burnout (42.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.01) and lower rates of professional fulfillment (35.1% vs. 50.4%, p < 0.01) than male physicians. Female physicians reported lower ratings for self-compassion and multiple culture of wellness factors. After adjusting for demographic factors and academic rank, the study team identified multiple culture of wellness factors (perceived appreciation, schedule control, work environment diversity and inclusion) and self-compassion as attenuating the significant relationship between gender and burnout. Only perceived appreciation attenuated the significant relationship between gender and professional fulfillment. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated higher rates of burnout and lower rates of professional fulfillment among female vs. male physician faculty.

The reasons for gender inequities in medicine, including academic EM, are multifactorial and include disadvantageous institutional parental, family, and promotion policies; workplace environment and culture; implicit biases; and a paucity of women physician leader role models, mentors, and sponsors. To address some of the challenges of gender inequities and career advancement for women in academic EM, we established an innovative, peer-driven, multi-institutional consortium of women EM faculty employed at four distinct hospitals affiliated with one medical school.

"Diversity in Surgery: A Historical, International, and Contemporary Perspective",Cortes-Guiral D.; ; Mayol J.; Wexner S.D.,"Purpose of Review: The major challenges to entry and advancement in surgical careers encountered by women and by underrepresented minority (URM) groups are sadly centuries old problems. Despite relatively recent recognition of significant disparities in equity and equality and under-representation in surgery, these unacceptable problems persist. The traditional lack of diversity seems to have persisted longer and in a more apparent way in surgery than in other disciplines within medicine and as compared to other professions. It is well recognized that diversity is a major workplace asset as attested to by a myriad of objective metrics. Recent Findings: Some of the disturbing inequities experienced by women and by other URM groups include income, career promotion, and academic recognition, despite adjusting for age, specialty, productivity, and years of experience. While some improvements have been made, much work remains to be done to address and rectify these inappropriate and unacceptable disparities. Success is contingent upon delivery of this crucial message. The traditional channels of dissemination of such information including the publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts, the delivery of lectures, and the establishment of organizations have been augmented by the use of social media platforms. <ovid:br/>Summary: Social media has emerged as a democratizer, giving voice to all surgeons regardless of gender identification, race, nationality, ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual preferences, or other demographic factors. Furthermore, the immediacy of social media allows surgeons all over the world to connect and share these issues regardless of location or time zone. Success in increasing diversity will benefit surgeons, surgeons' workplaces, and patients, representing a rational and wise use of social media to catalyze and expedite this success.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,/,Current Surgery Reports,9,5,14,2011397755,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40137-021-00289-3,,#534,Cortes-Guiral 2021,"",""

We evaluated current core cardiology trainee perspectives on cardiac catheterization training across Canada and identified potential barriers to pursuing a career in interventional cardiology (IC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Residents from all cardiology training programs across Canada (n=15 programs) were provided open and closed ended questions regarding the ability of their programs to address the mandatory components of their core angiography rotations. Programs were divided based on size for analysis. A small program was defined as <= 10 total trainees, a medium program as 11-15 trainees and a large program as > 15 trainees. Survey responses were received from 82 residents (82/206, 40% response rate). There was equal representation from all three years of training (post-graduate year (PGY)-4: n=24, 30%, PGY-5: n=28, 35%, PGY-6: n=29, 36%) and 39% of respondents were female (n=32). Overall 91% of trainees (n=70/77) felt that their program met the RCPSC requirements for cardiac catheterization. Of the trainees who felt that their training was inadequate, most common reasons indicated were lack of right heart catheterization exposure and lack of structured teaching specifically related to hemodynamics. When stratified by PGY of training or program size, there were no statistically significant differences in comfort with procedural skills or hemodynamic interpretation. The proportion of teaching by faculty was higher in small programs (p=0.039). There was a higher proportion of trainees who indicated that they had no structured cardiac catheterization teaching in medium sized programs (p=0.041). Only 22% of residents (n=18) identified IC as a career goal. Trainee-identified barriers to a career in IC are outlined in Figure 1 and stratified by gender. Lifestyle and family considerations were the two most common barriers with no statistically significant difference between genders (p=1.000 and p=0.18 respectively).

Factors affecting fellowship choices among us residents: A nationwide survey,Nadeem M.; ; Moon G.; Bader N.; Antunes C.,"Introduction: Despite the recognition of gender parity in medicine as crucial for creating a culture of diversity and equity, women are under-represented in the field of gastroenterology (GI). From 2007 to 2019, the total number of Internal Medicine female physicians have increased from 32% to 43 %. In GI the trend has not been the same. In fact, as of 2019, only a third of the gastroenterology trainees and 18% of practicing gastroenterologists were females. Literature is scarce on factors limiting female residents from pursuing a career in gastroenterology. To address this, we designed this nationwide survey. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 500 ACGME accredited Internal Medicine and Medicine-Pediatrics programs were identified via FREIDA database. Individual emails were sent to program directors and program coordinators starting in May 2021. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 144 residents have completed the survey until now. Demographics are shown in the figure A. Sixty-eight percent of respondents were interested in applying for a fellowship with the top 3 choices being GI (23%), Cardiology (13 %), and Pulmonary and Critical care (11%). Notably, 44 % (n564) responded that they have previously considered a career in GI but of those, only about half (n535) still have a plan to pursue. Of all the females who reported interest in GI, less than half (20 out 43) are still planning on applying for a GI fellowship. Among the factors cited by women no longer considering a career in GI are competitiveness of the fellowship, having a female mentor (70%) and exposure to GI during residency (97%) greatly impacted their career choice. Interestingly, 53% of these women didn't have any female faculty in their GI department. More than half of the total respondents perceive GI as not female-friendly and only a quarter believed that endoscopy may be more challenging for women. Three-fourths of the total participants agreed that there is a need for more women in GI. Having a supportive partner, paid maternity leaves, work-life balance, financial security, proximity to family, and student loans were highlighted as some of the major factors that affect career choices in women. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from our nationwide survey shows that .50% females who had interest in GI will not pursue a Gastroenterology fellowship career.

Among women, 12.4% were division or unit heads, compared with 45.5% of men, with most women (74.3%) being attending medical oncologists, compared with 45.5% of men. More males were professors (34.4% versus 14.2% of females), had a PhD (46.7% versus 28.8%), and/or had led clinical research groups (41.1% versus 9.7%). Spending time overseas after completing a residency was also more common for men than women (34.4% versus 20.4%). Professional satisfaction was similar between genders, driven primarily by patient care and intellectual stimulation. More women (40.7%) considered parenthood to have a strong negative impact on their career, compared with men (9.0%). Main perceived barriers to gender equality included a lack of work-life balance (72.6% women, 44.4% men), bias of peers and superiors (50.0% women, 18.9% men), and different career goals (41.2% women, 24.4% men). Preferred solutions included educational programs and scholarships (52.9%), communication and leadership training (35.8%), childcare at conferences (33.2%), and postmaternity return-to-work incentives (32.0%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There is a clear paucity of equal opportunities for female oncologists in Spain. This can be addressed by encouraging professional development and merit recognition particularly for younger female oncologists, and empowering women to be involved in management and leadership of institutions and professional societies.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors",2021,/,ESMO Open,6,2,100048,2010924831,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100048,33556897,#538,Elez 2021,"",""
"187 An Assessment of a Diversity, Inclusion, and Racial Equity Curriculum in Emergency Medicine Residency Training",Patel K.; ; Ansari S.; Hexom B.; Dissanayake V.,"Study Objectives: Professionalism plays a significant role in all facets of healthcare provision, however implicit bias endangers our capacity to ensure health equity in patient care. During summer 2020, a needs and climate assessment on diversity and inclusion was conducted among faculty and staff in a single urban academic emergency department (ED). In response, we created a deliberate and formal diversity, inclusion and racial equity (DIRE) curriculum online with 70% participation expected as a mandatory resident requirement. This study aimed to evaluate this biweekly curriculum in its effectiveness in improving knowledge, satisfaction and attitudes. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study was conducted using an anonymous Google Forms survey six months after implementation. Eight questions evaluated participant knowledge, eight questions evaluated satisfaction, and six questions evaluated attitudes toward future sessions. Participation rates were tracked and compared to residency conference attendance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): As of January 2021, 94.4% of residents achieved 70% participation in the DIRE curriculum. In comparison, attendance to traditional didactics was 76%. Out of 36 total residents, 21 responded to the mid-year survey. Table 1 summarizes the breakdown of the three domains of knowledge, satisfaction, and attitudes related to curriculum content. Additional commentary from respondents demonstrated three themes for improvement of the curriculum: 1) More live discussions 2) More videos and less reading materials 3) Less frequent assignments. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Although ""race,"" ""sex,"" ""equity,"" and ""disparities"" are not mentioned in the 2019 Model of Clinical Practice in Emergency Medicine, our study demonstrates a desire and need for this focus in our residency didactics. The responses from our residents have shown positive feedback, high rates of program completion and satisfactory knowledge retention. Using the results of our survey, we have adapted the DIRE curriculum to occur monthly instead of biweekly, and to include more multimedia resources and live discussions. Future directions include coverage of other vulnerable groups, as well as the nuances of end-of-life care related to the diverse cultures we see in the ED. This model may serve as a blueprint for other programs seeking to build a cultural humility curriculum in graduate medical education.

ROLE OF SPORTS PSYCHOLOGY IN COLLEGE PHYSICAL EDUCATION,Li J.; ,"Background: Sports psychology is a side branch of psychology application in sports. It reflects the performance and actual law of sports activities comprehensively, and it is a discipline to study the characteristics of psychological activities and the rules of activities that human beings show in the specific sports activities. Since China entered the reform of teaching curriculum, colleges and universities have made many attempts in the curriculum setting, and expect to better train the comprehensive quality of students, gradually improve the attention to the physical education curriculum, let students participate in more sports activities, strengthen students' physique and cultivate more interests and interests of students. Students in the process of engaging in specific sports activities in school will encounter different activity environment and problems, will produce different psychological activities, which affect their own sports behaviors. Positive psychological activities can promote students to actively accept learning, which will help to improve and improve the quality of physical education in Colleges and universities, the negative psychological activities will affect the students' learning beliefs and enthusiasm, and hinder the development and progress of students' physical education learning. The application of sports psychology will promote the development of students' character and comprehensive quality education, and can change the negative psychological activities produced by students in time, which is of great significance to the implementation of physical education in Contemporary Colleges and universities and the cultivation of students' comprehensive quality. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The research of sports psychology in college sports teaching focuses on students' cognition of sports activities, students' emotion, sports purpose, students' personality and physical function differences, mainly exploring students' psychological activities and psychological quality in sports teaching. The application of sports psychology in college physical education can not only improve the quality of physical education, but also play a correct role in guiding the students' psychology to participate in sports activities, making college physical education more interesting and favored by students. In recent years, under the promotion of the reform of teaching system in Colleges and universities, colleges and universities gradually began to pay attention to the education of students' comprehensive quality, among which college physical education is an important part. Physical education is a course to cultivate teenagers' positive sports thoughts and improve their own physical quality, which plays an important role in the overall cultivation of students' comprehensive quality in Colleges and universities. Exploring the specific application of sports psychology in college physical education has practical significance in promoting the smooth development of physical education curriculum. Combined with specific examples, this paper puts forward some suggestions on the application of sports psychology, so as to improve the quality of sports teaching and promote the development of students' comprehensive quality education. Subjects and methods: (1) Teachers should have a comprehensive understanding of students. In the process of physical education teaching in Colleges and universities, physical education teachers face a lot of students. Personality differences, ability differences and gender differences among individuals will have an impact on specific physical education teaching. The differences among students make students have different enthusiasm for the same sports activities, which is not conducive to the unified physical education teaching of all students. Therefore, before carrying out sports activities, PE teachers should have a comprehensive understanding of all students, pay attention to each individual student, especially the individual student with obvious personality characteristics, and communicate with the class teacher and students before teaching, so as to understand the current psychological activities of students, and know their sports hobbies and their own sports literacy, In order to improve the quality of physical education, we should grasp the students' sports quality, sports hobbies, psychological dynamics and other aspects, make timely adjustments in physical education teaching, formulate suitable courses for teaching, and improve the quality of physical education teaching. For example, physical education teachers should make clear the physical differences between male and female students, and adjust the content of physical education. The content of physical training for female students should be appropriately reduced in intensity and amount of training, and some training of coordination and flexibility should be added; The male students should increase the intensity of physical training, more physical and strength training, the difficulty can be improved. (2) Realize the organic combination of sports psychology theory and practice. In order to apply sports psychology in physical education teaching and play its important role, the first step is to organically combine the theory and practice of sports psychology. Only when the theoretical knowledge of sports psychology is applied to the specific physical education teaching practice in Colleges and universities, can it play its role in promoting the progress of physical education teaching. For example, physical education teachers use the imagery training method in sports psychology to let students consciously and autonomously imitate, repeat, adjust and create their own actions through the already formed imagery of sports activities in the brain, so as to form real image activities in the brain, To help students learn sports activities, the combination of imagery training and action skills training, cross, help students memorize action skills, master action essentials, and improve students' learning effect. (3) Using diversified teaching methods to apply sports psychology. The application and promotion of sports psychology needs to be realized through diversified teaching methods. Different teaching modes and contents are introduced into the physical education teaching in Colleges and universities, so as to enrich the environment and content of physical education teaching, provide students with more choices of sports activities, create more novel teaching methods, and provide a diverse and interesting learning environment, Let students more willing to participate in physical education, the application of sports psychology reflected in the diversified teaching practice, play its role in actively promoting physical education. <ovid:br/>Result(s): (1) Eliminate students' timidity and fear in physical education learning. Fear and timidity in physical education mainly refers to the students' fear of a certain action or a certain exercise due to their lack of sports ability. When students think that their physical fitness level or the ability to complete a technical action is quite different from the technical requirements, and they worry that they will have injury accidents, fear and timidity will occur, It's psychologically powerless. Helplessness, lack of confidence in their own ability, self devaluation, worry, nervousness, decreased memory, narrow thinking, anxiety level. Psychologically, the heart rate and breathing speed up, the blood pressure rises, the face is pale, the cold sweat, the cerebral cortex suppresses the diffusion, the original dynamic stereotype is destroyed. The psychological and physiological changes will inevitably affect the students' behavior response. Timidity, fear, in the behavior will appear slow reaction, movement disorder, four feet shaking, muscle stiffness, soft hands and feet, in this case, students are sure to complete the technical action. Therefore, we must find out the causes of students' timidity and fear in teaching. If the movement has certain difficulty, we should strengthen the protection and help, encourage students to focus on completing the movement, if it is for other reasons, we should strengthen the practice, improve the students' psychology. Stress ""level, let students learn to control their emotions, and targeted for some adaptive training, and finally make it to a normal state.",2021,/,Psychiatria Danubina,33,Supplement 5,S46EP  - S48,643329380,,,#540,Li 2021,"",""
200 Gender Bias Influences Attending's Asked to Interpret EKGs in the Emergency Department,Kazemzadeh S.; ; Laden B.; Brewer K.; Miller S.,"Study Objectives: Implicit bias in the workplace has been a subject of growing interest in recent years. There is evidence to support subconscious biases affect women in all fields, including medicine. There is a perception that in the emergency department (ED), nursing staff will preferentially go to the male attending physician for electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation. Based on this, hypothesize that male emergency medicine attendings are asked to interpret and sign off on EKGs more frequently than female attendings, particularly when the EKG is for a patient not assigned to a physician. Our objective was to identify general trends regarding sex disparities in EKG reading. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in the ED at a rural, Level I trauma center. We reviewed the charts of patients who received an EKG at the Vidant Medical Center Emergency Department between November 2016 and September 2017 while a male-female dyad was working on the ""P side"" (urgent side). We recorded sex of the attending physician who read the EKG, sex of the person handing the EKG, whether the EKG was assigned to an attending and if so, whether the EKG was read by the assigned attending. Chi-square analysis was performed to identify associations between attending sex and all other variables with p<0.05 indicating significance. This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the University and Medical Center IRB of East Carolina University. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 29,757 eligible charts were identified for the study. At the time of analysis, data from 329 charts had been extracted. Our data demonstrated that the EKGs were read by male attendings in 56% of cases and by female attendings in 44% of cases. Of these EKGs, 57% were assigned, meaning an attending was assigned to the patient prior to performing the EKG, and 43% unassigned. Of the assigned EKGs, 91% were read by the correct assigned attending and 9% were read by a different attending. Unassigned EKGs were more likely to be read by a male attending (p=0.003). Individuals handing the EKG were more likely to give them to an attending of the same sex as themselves (p<0.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Results suggest that the ED nursing staff is more likely to consult a male physician for interpretation if an EKG is unassigned.

The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Equity, Quality, and Inclusion in Trauma Surgery Ad Hoc Task Force (EAST4ALL) sought to raise awareness and provide resources to combat these inequities. METHODS A study was conducted of EAST members to ascertain areas of inequity and lack of inclusion. Specific problems and barriers were identified that hindered inclusion. Toolkits were developed as resources for individuals and institutions to address and overcome these barriers. RESULTS Four key areas were identified: (1) harassment and discrimination, (2) gender pay gap or parity, (3) implicit bias and microaggressions, and (4) call-out culture. A diverse panel of seven surgeons with experience in overcoming these barriers either on a personal level or as a chief or chair of surgery was formed. Four scenarios based on these key areas were proposed to the panelists, who then modeled responses as allies. CONCLUSION Despite perceived progress in addressing discrimination and inequity, residents and faculty continue to encounter barriers at the workplace at levels today similar to those decades ago. Action is needed to address inequities and lack of inclusion in acute care surgery. The EAST is working on fostering a culture that minimizes bias and recognizes and addresses systemic inequities, and has provided toolkits to support these goals.

Interventions addressing implicit gender bias in surgical residency training,Ibrahim N.; ; Erickson E.; Schofield M.,"Introduction: Implicit gender bias disproportionately affects female surgical trainees. This review seeks to identify the interventions made in different surgical training programs to combat the effects of implicit bias against female surgical residents. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The PubMed database was used to conduct a literature review of English-language publications between the years of 2010 and 2020. A total number of 13 articles were identified using the following search terms and phrases: 'implicit bias gender residency programs,' 'gender bias residency,' 'sex bias otolaryngology,' 'gender bias resident,' and 'sex bias surgery residency.' Results: A diverse cohort of literature was examined including randomized control trials, task force descriptions, and literature reviews. Of these studies, 5 identified gender bias workshop training, 5 identified mentorship, 6 identified the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and 3 identified standardized language for evaluations of trainees as key interventions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Many of the interventions identified in this review can be used in combination to create a more equitable environment for female surgical trainees. The IAT and workshops are useful for identifying and addressing one's own biases. Standardized feedback helps eliminate bias in evaluations of trainees. Mentorship and faculty buy-in are crucial for establishing a culture open to addressing implicit gender bias. There have been limited guidelines in place to address implicit bias against female surgical trainees.

"How Do Medical Students Perceive Diversity in Orthopaedic Surgery, and How Do Their Perceptions Change after an Orthopaedic Clinical Rotation?",Rahman R.; ; Zhang B.; Humbyrd C.J.; Laporte D.,"BackgroundA diverse physician workforce improves the quality of care for all patients, and there is a need for greater diversity in orthopaedic surgery. It is important that medical students of diverse backgrounds be encouraged to pursue the specialty, but to do so, we must understand students' perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics. We also currently lack knowledge about how participation in an orthopaedic clinical rotation might influence these perceptions.Questions/purposes(1) How do the perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedic surgery compare among medical students of different gender identities, races or ethnicities, and sexual orientations? (2) How do perceptions change after an orthopaedic clinical rotation among members of demographic groups who are not the majority in orthopaedics (that is, cis-gender women, underrepresented racial minorities, other racial minorities, and nonheterosexual people)?MethodsWe surveyed students from 27 US medical schools who had completed orthopaedic rotations. We asked about their demographic characteristics, rotation experience, perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics, and personal views on specialty choice. Questions were derived from diversity, equity, and inclusion climate surveys used at major academic institutions. Cis-gender men and cis-gender women were defined as those who self-identified their gender as men or women, respectively, and were not transgender. Forty-five percent (59 of 131) of respondents were cis-men and 53% (70 of 131) were cis-women; 49% (64 of 131) were white, 20% (26 of 131) were of underrepresented racial minorities, and 31% (41 of 131) were of other races. Eighty-five percent (112 of 131) of respondents were heterosexual and 15% (19 of 131) reported having another sexual orientation. We compared prerotation and postrotation perceptions of diversity and inclusion between majority and nonmajority demographic groups for each demographic domain (for example, cis-men versus cis-women). We also compared prerotation to postrotation perceptions within each nonmajority demographic group. To identify potential confounding variables, we performed univariate analysis to compare student and rotation characteristics across the demographic groups, assessed using an alpha of 0.05. No potential confounders were identified. Statistical significance was assessed at a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of 0.0125. Our estimated response percentage was 26%. To determine limitations of nonresponse bias, we compared all early versus late responders and found that for three survey questions, late responders had a more favorable perception of diversity in orthopaedic surgery, whereas for most questions, there was no difference.ResultsBefore rotation, cis-women had lower agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic culture (mean score 0.96 +/- 0.75) compared with cis-men (1.4 +/- 1.1) (mean difference 0.48 [95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.81]; p = 0.004), viewed orthopaedic surgery as less diverse (cis-women 0.71 +/- 0.73 versus cis-men 1.2 +/- 0.92; mean difference 0.49 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.78]; p = 0.001) and more sexist (cis-women 1.3 +/- 0.92 versus cis-men 1.9 +/- 1.2; mean difference 0.61 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.99]; p = 0.002), believed they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally (cis-women 2.8 +/- 1.0 versus cis-men 1.9 +/- 1.3; mean difference 0.87 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.3]; p < 0.001), and were less likely to pursue orthopaedic surgery (cis-women 1.4 +/- 1.4 versus cis-men 2.6 +/- 1.1; mean difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.6]; p < 0.001). Before rotation, underrepresented minorities had less agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (0.73 +/- 0.72) compared with white students (1.5 +/- 0.97) (mean difference 0.72 [95% CI 0.35 to 1.1]; p < 0.001). Many of these differences between nonmajority and majority demographic groups ceased to exist after rotation. Compared with their own prerotation beliefs, after rotation, cis-women believed more that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (prerotation mean score 0.96 +/- 0.75 versus postrotation mean score 1.2 +/- 0.96; mean difference 0.60 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.98]; p = 0.002) and that orthopaedic surgery is friendlier (prerotation 2.3 +/- 1.2 versus postrotation 2.6 +/- 1.1; mean difference 0.41 [95% CI 0.14 to 0.69]; p = 0.004), more diverse (prerotation 0.71 +/- 0.73 versus postrotation 1.0 +/- 0.89; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.49]; p = 0.007), less sexist (prerotation 1.3 +/- 0.92 versus postrotation 1.9 +/- 1.0; mean difference 0.63 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.85]; p < 0.001), less homophobic (prerotation 2.1 +/- 1.0 versus postrotation 2.4 +/- 0.97; mean difference 0.27 [95% CI 0.062 to 0.47]; p = 0.011), and less racist (prerotation 2.3 +/- 1.1 versus postrotation 2.5 +/- 1.1; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.099 to 0.47]; p = 0.003). Compared with before rotation, after rotation cis-women believed less that they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally on the rotation (prerotation 2.8 +/- 1.0 versus postrotation 2.5 +/- 1.0; mean difference 0.31 [95% CI 0.12 to 0.50]; p = 0.002), as did nonheterosexual students (prerotation 2.4 +/- 1.4 versus postrotation 1.8 +/- 1.3; mean difference 0.56 [95% 0.21 to 0.91]; p = 0.004). Underrepresented minority students saw orthopaedic surgery as less sexist after rotation compared with before rotation (prerotation 1.5 +/- 1.1 versus postrotation 2.0 +/- 1.1; mean difference 0.52 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.89]; p = 0.007).ConclusionEven with an estimated 26% response percentage, we found that medical students of demographic backgrounds who are not the majority in orthopaedics generally perceived that orthopaedic surgery is less diverse and inclusive than do their counterparts in majority groups, but these views often change after a clinical orthopaedic rotation.Clinical RelevanceThese perceptions may be a barrier to diversification of the pool of medical student applicants to orthopaedics. However, participation in an orthopaedic surgery rotation is associated with mitigation of many of these negative perceptions among diverse students. Medical schools have a responsibility to develop a diverse workforce, and given our findings, schools should promote participation in a clinical orthopaedic rotation. Residency programs and orthopaedic organizations can also increase exposure to the field through the rotation and other means. Doing so may ultimately diversify the orthopaedic surgeon workforce and improve care for all orthopaedic patients.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Where Are We in Bridging the Gender Leadership Gap in Academic Medicine?,Valantine H.A.; ,"In nearly all walks of life, leadership sets the tone for what gets done, who does it, and how it is achieved. In 2020, the top ranks of academic medicine have not yet attained gender parity-an aspirational goal set 7 years ago in this journal as ""50:50 by 2020,"" and a vital aim for the United States' productivity and innovation as a leader in biomedical research. Parity in academic leadership for women and other groups underrepresented in science and medicine will seed the culture change necessary for inclusive excellence: environments in which individuals from all backgrounds thrive in their pursuit of new knowledge to benefit human health.In this Invited Commentary, the author describes the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) current system-wide framework and tools for creating cultures of inclusive excellence through a set of guiding principles and integrated strategies. Successful efforts will recognize that individually focused solutions are necessary but not sufficient for institutional culture change. In keeping with a systems approach are implementing accountability and transparency; establishing clear metrics of inclusion, diversity, and equity; tracking and evaluating such metrics; as well as tying these metrics to institutional reward systems.

Women in radiology: gender diversity is not a metric-it is a tool for excellence,Kubik-Huch R.A.; ; Vilgrain V.; Krestin G.P.; Reiser M.F.; Attenberger U.I.; Muellner A.U.; Hess C.P.; Hricak H.,"Abstract: Women in Focus: Be Inspired was a unique programme held at the 2019 European Congress of Radiology that was structured to address a range of topics related to gender and healthcare, including leadership, mentoring and the generational progression of women in medicine. In most countries, women constitute substantially fewer than half of radiologists in academia or private practice despite frequently accounting for at least half of medical school enrolees. Furthermore, the proportion of women decreases at higher academic ranks and levels of leadership, a phenomenon which has been referred to as a ""leaky pipeline"". Gender diversity in the radiologic workplace, including in academic and leadership positions, is important for the present and future success of the field. It is a tool for excellence that helps to optimize patient care and research; moreover, it is essential to overcome the current shortage of radiologists. This article reviews the current state of gender diversity in academic and leadership positions in radiology internationally and explores a wide range of potential reasons for gender disparities, including the lack of role models and mentorship, unconscious bias and generational changes in attitudes about the desirability of leadership positions. Strategies for both individuals and institutions to proactively increase the representation of women in academic and leadership positions are suggested. Key Points: * Gender-diverse teams perform better. Thus, gender diversity throughout the radiologic workplace, including in leadership positions, is important for the current and future success of the field. * Though women now make up roughly half of medical students, they remain underrepresented among radiology trainees, faculty and leaders. * Factors leading to the gender gap in academia and leadership positions in Radiology include a lack of role models and mentors, unconscious biases, other societal barriers and generational changes.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, The Author(s).",2020,/,European Radiology,30,3,1644EP  - 1652,2003820957,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06493-1,31802213,#548,Kubik-Huch 2020,"",""
Women Surgeons' Experiences of Interprofessional Workplace Conflict,Dossett L.A.; ; Vitous C.A.; Lindquist K.; Jagsi R.; Telem D.A.,"Importance: Gender differences in interprofessional conflict may exist and precipitate differential achievement, wellness, and attrition in medicine. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Although substantial attention and research has been directed toward improving gender equity in surgery and addressing overall physician wellness, research on the role of interprofessional conflict has been limited. The objective of this study was to understand scenarios driving interprofessional conflict involving women surgeons, the implications of the conflict on personal, professional, and patient outcomes, and how women surgeons navigate conflict adjudication. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A qualitative approach was used to explore the nature, implications, and ways of navigating interprofessional workplace conflict experienced by women surgeons. The setting was a national sample of US women surgeons. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit women surgeons in training or practice from annual surgical society meetings. Participants were eligible if they were currently in a surgical training program or surgical practice. Nearly all participants had experienced at least 1 workplace conflict with a nonphysician staff member resulting in a formal write-up. Exposures: A workplace conflict was defined as any conflict resulting in the nonphysician staff member taking action such as confronting the woman surgeon, reporting the event to supervisors, or filing a formal report. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Interviews were conducted between February 19, 2019, and June 21, 2019. Recordings were transcribed and deidentified. Inductive thematic analysis was used to examine data in relation to the research questions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty US women surgeons (8 [27%] age 25-34 years, 16 [53%] age 35-44 years, 5 [17%] age 45-54 years, and 1 [3%] age 55-64 years) of varying surgical specialties were interviewed. Conflicts were often reported as due to a breakdown in communication or from performance-related disputes. Participants perceived personal and professional implications including self-doubt, depression, frustration, anxiety, loss of sleep, reputational harms, and delays to advancement. Participants also described potential patient safety implications primarily due to decreased communication resulting from some surgeons being hesitant to engage in subsequent interactions.

Acting Wisely: Eliminating Negative Bias in Medical Education-Part 1: The Fundamentals,Plews-Ogan M.L.; ; Bell T.D.; Townsend G.; Canterbury R.J.; Wilkes D.S.,"Bias is a ubiquitous problem in human functioning. It has plagued medical decision making, making physicians prone to errors of perception and judgment. Racial, gender, ethnic, and religious negative biases infest physicians' perception and cognition, causing errors of judgment and behavior that are damaging. In Part 1 of this series of 2 papers, the authors address the problem of harmful bias, the science of cognition, and what is known about how bias functions in human perception and information processing. They lay the groundwork for an approach to reducing negative bias through awareness, reflection, and bias mitigation, an approach in which negative biases can be transformed-by education, experience, practice, and relationships-into positive biases toward one another. The authors propose wisdom as a conceptual framework for imagining a different way of educating medical students. They discuss fundamental cognitive, affective, and reflective components of wisdom-based education. They also review the skills of awareness, using debiasing strategies, compassion, fostering positive emotion, and reflection that are inherent to a wisdom-based approach to eliminating the negative effects of bias in medical education. In Part 2, the authors answer a key question: How can medical educators do better? They describe the interpersonal, structural, and cultural elements supportive of a wisdom-based learning environment, a culture of respect and inclusion in medical education.",2020,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,95,12 Addressing Harmful Bias and Eliminating Discrimination in Health Professions Learning Environments,S11EP  - S15,632788445,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003699,32889935,#550,Plews-Ogan 2020,"",""
Gender Differences in Surgeon Burnout and Barriers to Career Satisfaction: A Qualitative Exploration,Lu P.W.; ; Columbus A.B.; Fields A.C.; Melnitchouk N.; Cho N.L.,"Background: Physician burnout is a highly prevalent issue in the surgical community. Burnout is associated with poor career satisfaction; female gender, and younger age place surgeons at higher risk for burnout. Here, we examined drivers behind burnout and career dissatisfaction in female and junior surgical faculty, with specific attention paid to gender-based differences. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Participants included full-time surgery faculty members at a single academic surgery center. Both male and female faculty members were included, at ranks ranging from instructor to associate professor. Semistructured interviews were conducted by a faculty member at the institution until thematic saturation was reached. Field notes were compiled from each interview, and these data were coded thematically. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Fourteen female faculty and nine male faculty members were interviewed. For both female and male faculty, lack of control with work life was a significant theme contributing to burnout. Positive factors contributing to career satisfaction for both genders included enjoyment of patient care and teaching, teamwork and collegiality, and leadership support. For female faculty, the major theme of gender bias in the workplace as a risk factor for burnout was prominent. Male faculty struggled more than their female counterparts with guilt over complications and second victim syndrome. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender differences driving career dissatisfaction and burnout exist between female and male surgical faculty.

Energizing the Conversation: How to Identify and Overcome Gender Inequalities in Academic Medicine,Sakowski S.A.; ; Feldman E.L.; Jagsi R.; Singer K.,"Gender inequality exists in advanced faculty and leadership positions at academic medical centers; however, despite growing awareness, how to best approach and rectify the issue is unknown. To energize the conversation on gender inequality at one academic medical center, chairs and women faculty were surveyed to identify barriers faced by women navigating their careers. A symposium with short talks to increase awareness, a panel with University leaders to discuss issues and successful strategies to overcome gaps, and focus groups to delve further into key areas that underlie inequity through an active cafe style format were planned and implemented. This multifaceted approach resulted in a wealth of knowledge. The symposium and panel highlighted important relevant issues and offered personal strategies for successful career advancement, while the focus group discussions further identified barriers and inspired ongoing efforts across departments and novel approaches to overcome three key issues (work-life integration, deliberate promotion of mentor/sponsor relationships, and overcoming unconscious bias) identified through the initial surveys. Compiled data were then disseminated to participants and University leaders to enhance awareness of available programs and prompt action in critical areas lacking support. Overall, the approach indicated that securing support from leaders and the academic community alike are pertinent to emphasize actions needed to overcome issues affecting women in academic medicine. Moreover, bringing leaders and faculty together for an informational session and brainstorming appears to energize the conversation. Such efforts can ultimately instill change and establish an inclusive environment where all members of the academic medicine community can thrive.",2020,/,The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,40,4,274EP  - 278,633617224,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000296,33284179,#553,Sakowski 2020,"",""
Four types of gender bias affecting women surgeons and their cumulative impact,Hutchison K.; ,"Women are under-represented in surgery, especially in leadership and academic roles, and face a gender pay gap. There has been little work on the role of implicit biases in women's under-representation in surgery. Nor has the impact of epistemic injustice, whereby stereotyping influences knowledge or credibility judgements, been explored. This article reports findings of a qualitative in-depth interview study with women surgeons that investigates gender biases in surgery, including subtle types of bias. The study was conducted with 46 women surgeons and trainees of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Maximum variance sampling strategies ensured a comprehensive set of perspectives. Data were analysed using iterative thematic analysis to document and classify forms of gender bias experienced by the participants, including implicit bias and epistemic injustice. It found four types of bias affecting women surgeons: (1) workplace factors such as access to parental leave and role models; (2) epistemic injustices-unfair assessments of women surgeons' credibility by patients and colleagues; (3) stereotyped expectations that they will carry out more of surgery's carework, such as meeting the emotional needs of patients and (4) objectification. Implicit biases arose in each category. Given that many of the biases identified in this study are small, are harmless on their own and are not necessarily under anyone's conscious control, important questions arise regarding how they cause harm and how to address them. I draw on theoretical work on cumulative harm to answer these questions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Pediatric physiatrists who identified as women were more likely to work part-time but were demographically similar to their colleagues who identified as men. The odds of having no leadership role were higher for women (odds ratio=2.17; P=.02) than men. Pediatric physiatrists who identified as men made on average (in US dollars +/- SD) 244,798+/-52,906 annually compared with those who identified as women 224,497+/-60,756. The average annual difference in full-time salary was $20,311 in favor of those who identified as men (95% confidence interval, $3135-$37,486).

Addressing Gender-Related Implicit Bias in Surgical Resident Physician Education: A Set of Guidelines,Hemphill M.E.; ; Maher Z.; Ross H.M.,"While it is the goal of academic institutions to train male and female resident physicians equally, gender-related implicit bias may play a role in resident training, thus impacting the quality and fairness of education. Implicit bias may be one of the reasons for the discrepancies that exist in resident training, specifically in learning style, evaluations by faculty members, and treatment of female residents by other clinicians. Patterns of systemic gender-related implicit bias, we argue, remain pervasive in the healthcare system and affect medical education. This review identifies areas of surgical education that are susceptible to gender-related bias and provides recommendations to safeguard gender equity in resident education. We believe behavioral change can help maintain an inclusive learning environment. Using evidence from existing data, we generated guidelines to provide surgical educators in academic centers with information to further understanding of, training in, and steps toward overcoming gender-related implicit bias in resident education. Our guidelines include specific recommendations for educators to require training modules, remove bias from teaching resources, use formal introductory titles, maintain comparable evaluations, encourage women in surgery, adjust instructional methods, and caution self-reporting.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2020,/,Journal of Surgical Education,77,3,491EP  - 494,2004620670,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2019.12.014,31954662,#558,Hemphill 2020,"",""
Life satisfaction and mental health among transgender students in Norway,Anderssen N.; ; Sivertsen B.; Lonning K.J.; Malterud K.,"BACKGROUND: Social attitudes to transgender persons and other gender minorities vary around the world, and in many cultures, prejudices and social stigma are common.

Gender Disparity and Potential Strategies for Improvement in Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology,Galloway G.; ; Schmitt S.; Herman S.T.; La Roche S.,"Discrimination in the workplace when documented is illegal but is seen to still exist in some forms whether based on culture, race, or gender. Each of these disparities warrants further discussion and study because of their significant impacts on hiring decisions, career advancement, and compensation. In this article, the authors have focused their attention on gender disparity in the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology and shared the data currently available to them. At a time when the field of clinical neurophysiology has seen enormous growth, gender disparity in leadership and compensation remain. Despite the increasing number of women entering the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology, women remain underrepresented in national leadership positions. Many women physicians report experiencing gender discrimination despite increasing efforts by universities and medical centers to improve inclusivity and diversity. Equity and inclusivity are not the same and there is a disconnect between the increased numbers of women and their shared experiences in the workplace. Implicit bias undermines the ability of women to advance in their careers. For neurologists, data indicate that the latest gender pay gap is $56,000 (24%), increased from $37,000 in 2015, and is one of the largest pay gaps in any medical specialty. One third of the top 12 medical schools in the United States require that maternity leave be taken through disability coverage and/or sick benefits, and most family leave policies constrain benefits to the discretion of departmental leadership. The authors recommend strategies to improve gender disparity include institutional training to Identify and overcome biases, changes to professional organizations and national scientific meeting structure, transparency in academic hiring, promotion and compensation, and mentorship and sponsorship programs.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Chair Versus Chairman: Does Orthopaedics Use the Gendered Term More Than Other Specialties?,Peck C.J.; ; Schmidt S.J.; Latimore D.A.; O'Connor M.I.,"BackgroundOrthopaedics is the least gender-diverse medical specialty. Research suggests that the use of gendered language can contribute to workforce disparity and that gender-neutral language supports the inclusion and advancement of women, but the degree to which gender-neutral language is used by academic departments in what typically is a department's highest position (department chair) has not been characterized.Questions/purposes(1) Is the proportion of department websites that use the term chairman (as opposed to chair) greater in orthopaedics than in five other surgical and medical specialties? (2) Are departments led by chairs who are women less likely to use ""chairman"" than those led by men, and does this vary by specialty?MethodsSeven hundred fourteen official websites of orthopaedic, neurosurgery, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology departments affiliated with 129 allopathic medical schools were screened. Any use of the term chairman on title pages, welcome messages, and faculty profile pages was identified using a Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm and terms were classified based on their location on the site. The overall use of the term chairman was compared by specialty and gender of the chair.ResultsSixty percent of orthopaedic department websites (71 of 119) used the term chairman at least once, a proportion higher than that of pediatrics (36% [46 of 128]; OR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.63; p < 0.001), internal medicine (31% [38 of 122]; OR 0.030; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.53; p < 0.001), and obstetrics and gynecology (29% [37 of 126]; OR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.48; p < 0.001), but no different than that of neurosurgery (57% [54 of 94]; OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.6; p = 0.74) and general surgery (55% [69 of 125]; OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.4; p = 0.48). Across disciplines, departments whose chairs were women were much less likely to use the term chairman than departments whose chairs were men (14% [17 of 122] versus 50% [297 of 592]; OR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.28; p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe frequent use of the term chairman in orthopaedics, coupled with the preference of women to use the term chair, suggests considerable room for growth in the use of gender-equal language in orthopaedics.Clinical RelevanceOur current efforts to increase the number of women in orthopaedics may be undermined by gendered language, which can create and reinforce gendered culture in the field. Electing to use gender-neutral leadership titles, while a relatively small step in the pursuit of a more gender-equal environment, presents an immediate and no-cost way to support a more inclusive culture and counteract unconscious gender bias. Future studies should explore the individual attitudes of chairs regarding the use of gendered titles and identify additional ways in which biases may manifest; for example, the use of gendered language in interpersonal communications and the presence of unconscious bias in leadership evaluations. Continued efforts to understand implicit bias in orthopaedics can guide actionable strategies for counteracting gendered stereotypes of the specialty, in turn aiding initiatives to recruit and promote women in the field.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

While 98% of the top 200 universities in America employ a diversity officer and hundreds of millions of dollars are spent annually on diversity, its impact on gender parity in gastroenterology (GI) training remains unclear. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study on the leadership, applicants, and first-year fellows at all accredited North American GI fellowship programs from 2009-2018 with data from the American College of Gastroenterology, Association of American Medical Colleges, and American Board of Internal Medicine. Diversity offices/officials and their mission and initiatives were searched from institutional websites of fellowship programs, its affiliated hospital and academic institution. Chi-square and t-test were used to analyze gender distribution. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 397,634 applications from 7,672 applicants to 158 GI fellowship programs, 4958 first-year GI fellows, and the current leadership of 189 GI programs were included. Women represent 33% (2549) of GI fellowship applicants and 33% first-year GI fellows (1641), which were stable over the past 10 years despite the constant influx of female trainees upstream; women comprise 48% and 49% of the matriculating and graduating medical school class, respectively, and 40% of internal medicine residents. States in the Northeast (NY, MA, RI) and West Coast (CA, WA) were amongst the top quintile of female GI applicants (30-34%) while the Southern states (KY, OK, NM) had the lowest quintile (24-27%) (Figure 1). Men hold the vast majority (83%) of leadership positions, especially the most senior ranks of Internal Medicine (IM) Department Chair and GI Division Chair (Table 1). Institutions with male IM Department Chairs had an 8:1 male-to-female ratio (89% vs 11%) for GI Division Chairs, whereas the ratio is 2:1 (39% vs 31%) at institutions with female IM Department Chairs (p=0.01). Institutions with male GI Division Chairs has a 3:1 male-to-female ratio (77% vs 23%) of GI Fellowship Director, whereas the gender distribution is nearly on par (54% vs 46%) at institutions with female GI Division Chairs (p=0.03) (Table 1). Although diversity offices are present at 87% (164/189) of GI fellowships and/or its affiliated hospital/institution, less than half (46%, 87/189) have a mission or initiatives to promote women in medicine and its presence was not associated with gender parity (Table 1). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender disparity within GI program leadership and trainees continue to exist.

"Too male, too pale, too stale: A qualitative exploration of student experiences of gender bias within medical education",Brown M.E.L.; ; Hunt G.E.G.; Hughes F.; Finn G.M.,"Objective To explore medical student perceptions and experiences of gender bias within medical education. Setting Gender bias-a  prejudiced actions or thoughts based on the perception that women are not equal to men'-is a widespread issue. Within medicine, the pay gap, under-representation of women in senior roles and sexual harassment are among the most concerning issues demonstrating its presence and impact. While research investigating experiences of clinicians is gaining traction, investigation of medical students' experiences is lacking. This qualitative study analyses medical students' experiences of gender bias within their education to discern any patterns to this bias. Illuminating the current state of medical education gender bias will hopefully highlight areas in which student experience could be improved. Constructivist thematic analysis was used to analyse data, informed by William's patterns of gender bias, intersectional feminism and communities of practice theory. Participants Thirty-two medical students from multiple UK medical schools participated in individual interviews. Nine faculty members were also interviewed to triangulate data. Results Gender bias has an overt presence during medical student education, manifesting in line with William's patterns of bias, impacting career aspirations. Physical environments serve to manifest organisational values, sending implicit messages regarding who is most welcome-currently, this imagery remains a  too male, too pale..too stale'. Existing gender initiatives require careful scrutiny, as this work identifies the superficial application of positive action, and a failure to affect meaningful change. Conclusions Despite progress having been made regarding overt gender discrimination, implicit bias persists, with existing positive action inadequate in promoting the advancement of women. Institutions should mandate participation in implicit bias education programmes for all staff and must strive to revise the imagery within physical environments to better represent society. Gender initiatives, like Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, also require large-scale evaluation regarding their impact, which this work found to be lacking.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Resident-led health equity curriculum,Cleveland Manchanda E.; ; Chary A.; Molina M.; Dadabhoy F.; Landry A.,"Introduction: Resident physicians encounter many forms of discrimination directed towards patients and providers throughout their training. Resident-led initiatives to educate peers about health equity, implicit bias and microaggressions can increase awareness and skills for addressing these forms of discrimination, while creating peer support networks. Learning Objective: This resident-led longitudinal health equity curriculum aims to 1) raise awareness of race- and gender-based inequities in resident and patient experience, and 2) build residents' skills in addressing inequities and microaggressions. Curricular Design: Senior residents led a longitudinal five-session series (Health Equity Rounds) incorporated into the residency's yearlong didactic curriculum. Senior residents performed literature review and solicited residentsubmitted experiences of diversity in our practice environment to teach residents and faculty about health equity, race as a social construct, forms of racism including implicit bias and microaggressions, and provided strategies for addressing these topics. Quantitative (Table 1) and qualitative (Table 2) feedback was solicited through a survey with participating residents and faculty. The most useful sessions engaged residents in interactive discussions, leveraging their experiences to highlight how discrimination affects the work environment. Skill-building sessions facilitating practice of verbal interventions to address problematic interactions will be incorporated into future iterations of this curriculum. Impact: Resident-led initiatives about diversity and inclusion educate not only peers but also faculty at their institutions.

Evaluating the impact of language barriers on management of ischemic stroke,Berger T.; ; Levit E.; Abbasi B.; Lioutas V.-A.; Tellier J.,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of language barrier on the time to treatment decision. Our goal is to guide criteria for interpreter use during the critical time period of stroke presentation. <ovid:br/>Background(s): The NIHSS assigns 5 points for language-specific tasks. Moreover in non-verbal patients, tPA administration decisions necessitate discussions with next of kin. Language barriers might result in significant time delays in the critical treatment window. Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of acute stroke that received tPA at a tertiary, urban academic medical center in the Northeastern USA, in 2018-2019 English proficiency was defined as need for interpreter for routine medical care. The main endpoint was average time to treatment in English-proficient vs English non-proficient patients. We performed univariable comparisons of average time to treatment. We further stratified our analysis by medical complexity. Medically complex cases were defined as cases with logistical barriers, and relative contraindications that required additional investigation prior to decision making Results: Our cohort comprised 43 English-proficient patients (21% male, mean age 73+/- 16 years) and 10 English non-proficient (50% male, mean age 76+/-13 years. Time-to-treatment in Englishproficient patients was 0:58+/-0.019 vs 65+/-0.015 mins (p=0.27). When excluding medically complex cases, time-to-treatment in English-proficient patients was 49+/-0.01 vs 64+/-0.02 mins in English non-proficient patients (p=0.017) There was no significant difference in age or sex between the groups. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this retrospective single-center study we found that in medically non-complex patients with acute ischemic stroke, there was a significantly shorter time to treatment in English-proficient patients vs English non-proficient.

Embracing our values: Creating a social medicine core within academic hospital medicine,Schaeffer S.; ; Narayana S.; Eniasivam A.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Opportunities to promote social medicine are often not integrated within traditional hospital medicine priorities. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): Incorporate tenets of social medicine within the mission and culture of our hospital medicine division Develop a core group of hospital medicine faculty to engage in work around equity, advocacy, diversity, and inclusion within the realm of hospital medicine DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS) : Social medicine is care that encompasses health disparities, advocacy and equity, bias and privilege, and understanding local and national contexts that impact health. As hospitalists working with diverse patient and trainee groups, we sought to incorporate these topics into the core work done by our division. We first mapped social medicine concepts to existing areas of focus in our academic hospital medicine division: Quality Improvement (QI), Mentorship & Education, Patient Experience, and Faculty Development. Over one academic year, we developed novel activities in the following areas: Health Policy & Advocacy: We led faculty development sessions on health-related election issues, single payer system, and prescription drug pricing. We helped coordinate hospitalized patient voting assistance and participated in in state and national advocacy. Inpatient Health Disparities: With QI leadership, we assessed disparities in common inpatient metrics by gender, race and ethnicity, primary language, and payer and housing status. This led the division to select opioid prescribing and use of interpreter services as QI areas of focus. Care for Vulnerable Populations: We facilitated sessions on gun violence as a public health issue, trauma- informed care, and care of patients with limited English proficiency. We assessed physician uptake and use of video interpreters, to identify an intervention to improve their use. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We educated faculty on creating an inclusive teaching environment, responding to microaggressions, and promoting gender equity in medicine. We partnered with leadership to address enhance recruitment and hiring of diverse faculty, and promoted faculty participation in institutional diversity, equity, and inclusion training. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Social Medicine faculty development sessions were well-attended. Improving the use of interpreter services became our annual QI focus. Our division adopted a statement of diversity as part of faculty recruitment. We significantly increased the number of faculty from underrepresented and diverse backgrounds. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): In one academic year, 50% of faculty and all in leadership positions completed institutional diversity training. Projects among hospital medicine fellows showed a shift towards addressing Social Medicine issues (e.g., improving interpreter services, forming a Social Justice Discussion Group).

Academic emergency medicine faculty experiences with racial and sexual orientation discrimination,Lu D.W.; ; Pierce A.; Jauregui J.; Heron S.; Lall M.D.; Mitzman J.; McCarthy D.M.; Hartman N.D.; Strout T.D.,"Introduction: Despite the increasing diversity of individuals entering medicine, physicians from racial and sexual minority groups continue to experience bias and discrimination in the workplace. The objective of this study was to determine the current experiences and perceptions of discrimination on the basis of race and sexual orientation among academic emergency medicine (EM) faculty. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of EM faculty across six programs. Survey items included the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work (OGDW) Scale adapted for race and sexual orientation, and the frequency and source of experienced and observed discrimination. Group comparisons were made using t-tests or chi-square analyses, and relationships between race or sexual orientation, and we evaluated physicians' experiences using correlation analyses. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 141 out of 352 (40.1%) subjects completed at least a portion of the survey. Non-White physicians reported higher mean racial OGDW scores than their White counterparts (13.4 vs 8.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference, -7.7 - -2.9). Non-White EM faculty were also more likely to report having experienced discriminatory treatment based on race than were White EM faculty (48.0% vs 12.6%; CI for difference, 16.6% - 54.2%), although both groups were equally likely to report having observed race-based discrimination of another physician. EM faculty who identified as sexual minorities reported higher mean sexual minority OGDW scores than their heterosexual counterparts (11.1 vs 7.1; 95% CI for difference, -7.3 - -0.6).

Are Women Proportionately Represented as Speakers at Orthopaedic Surgery Annual Meetings? A Cross-Sectional Analysis,Gerull K.M.; ; Kim D.J.; Cogsil T.; Rhea L.; Cipriano C.,"BackgroundIn spite of efforts to improve gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery, women remain underrepresented, particularly with increasing academic rank. Opportunities to speak at society meetings are an important component of building a national reputation and achieving academic promotions. However, little is known about the gender diversity of orthopaedic society annual meeting speakers. Data on this topic are needed to determine whether these speaking roles are equitably distributed between men and women, which is fundamental to equalizing professional opportunity in academic orthopaedic surgery.Question/purposes(1) Is the gender diversity of invited speakers at annual orthopaedic subspecialty society meetings proportional to society membership? (2) Are there differences in the proportion of women invited to speak in technical sessions (defined as sessions on surgical outcomes, surgical technique, nonsurgical musculoskeletal care, or basic science) versus nontechnical sessions (such as sessions on diversity, work-life balance, work environment, social media, education, or peer relationships)? (3) Does the presence of women on the society executive committee and annual meeting program committee correlate with the gender diversity of invited speakers? (4) Do societies with explicit diversity efforts (the presence of a committee, task force, award, or grant designed to promote diversity, or mention of diversity as part of the organization's mission statement) have greater gender diversity in their invited speakers?MethodsSeventeen national orthopaedic societies in the United States were included in this cross-sectional study of speakership in 2018. Each society provided the number of men and women members for their society in 2018. The genders of all invited speakers were tabulated using each society's 2018 annual meeting program. Speakers of all credentials and degrees were included. All manuscript/abstract presenters were excluded from all analyses because these sessions are selected by blinded scientific review. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of women versus men in nontechnical speaking roles. The relationship between women in society leadership roles and women in all speaking roles was investigated using a linear regression analysis. A chi square test was used to compare the proportion of women in all speaking roles between societies with stated diversity efforts with societies without such initiatives.ResultsOverall, women society members were proportionately represented as annual meeting speakers, comprising 13% (4389 of 33,051) of all society members and 14% (535 of 3928) of all annual meeting speakers (% difference 0.6% [95% CI -0.8 to 1.5]; p = 0.60); however, representation of women speakers ranged from 0% to 33% across societies. Women were more likely than men to have nontechnical speaking roles, with 6% (32 of 535) of women's speaking roles being nontechnical, compared with 2% (51 of 3393) of men's speaking roles being nontechnical (OR 4.2 [95% CI 2.7 to 6.5]; p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the proportion of women in society leadership roles and the proportion of women in speaking roles (r = 0.73; p < 0.001). Societies with a stated diversity effort had more women as conference speakers; with 19% (375 of 1997) women speakers for societies with a diversity effort compared with 8% (160 of 1931) women speakers in societies without a diversity effort (OR 2.6 [95% CI 2.1 to 3.1]; p < 0.001).ConclusionsAlthough the percentage of women in speaking roles was proportional to society membership overall, our study identified opportunities to improve gender representation in several societies and in technical versus nontechnical sessions. Positioning more women in leadership roles and developing stated diversity efforts are two interventions that may help societies improve proportional representation; we recommend that all societies monitor the gender representation of speakers at their annual meetings and direct conference organizing committees to create programs with gender equity.Clinical RelevanceSociety leadership, national oversight committees, invited speakers, and conference attendees all contribute to the layers of accountability for equitable speakership at annual meetings. National steering committees such as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Diversity Advisory Board should monitor and report conference speaker diversity data to create systemwide accountability. Conference attendees and speakers should critically examine conference programs and raise concerns if they notice inequities. With these additional layers of accountability, orthopaedic surgery annual meetings may become more representative of their society members.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

3:36 PM Abstract No. 121 Industry payment gender disparity in academic interventional radiology,Deipolyi A.; ; Becker A.; Covey A.; Chimonas S.; Forman H.; Copen W.,"Purpose: Industry relationships support technologic development in interventional radiology (IR) and create individual professional and financial opportunities. Despite the growing awareness of the value of nurturing workplace diversity, women remain underrepresented in IR. The purpose was to describe possible gender disparities in industry payments in IR. Materials: For this retrospective study, each academic IR physician in the United States and his/her academic rank was identified by searching the websites of IR departments with ACGME-accredited IR fellowship programs. Publicly available Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services databases, including the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, Physician Compare, and Open Payments, were queried to record each physician's gender, years in practice, and industry payments in 2018. Scopus was manually searched to identify each physician's h index. Statistical analysis was performed with R 3.4.4, using Wilcoxon and chi-squared tests to compare payments between genders, and a general linear model to evaluate the impact of gender, years in practice, academic rank, and h index on payments. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 842 IR physicians, 108 (13%) were female. In total, $14,206,599.41 was received by 686 (81%) physicians; women received $147,975.28 (1%). A higher percentage of men (83%) than women (74%) received payments (P = 0.047). Median total payments were also higher for men ($792) than women ($535) (P = 0.012). Male gender, years in practice, academic rank, and h index were all independent predictors of higher payments. Industry payments in support of technologic advancement (research grants, royalties/licenses, and stocks/ownership) were received exclusively by men. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite constituting 13% of academic IR doctors in the United States, women earned only 1% of total payments, receiving fewer and lower industry payments. Regardless of years in practice, h index, and academic rank, gender independently predicted industry payments. Gender disparity in IR physician-industry relationships may contribute to or worsen the ongoing underrepresentation of women in IR, and warrants further scrutiny.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020",2020,/,Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,31,3 Supplement,S57,2004990874,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2019.12.152,,#571,Deipolyi 2020,"",""
Empowering Women Researchers in the New Century: IADR's Strategic Direction,Ioannidou E.; ; Letra A.; Shaddox L.M.; Teles F.; Ajiboye S.; Ryan M.; Fox C.H.; Tiwari T.; D'Souza R.N.,"Gender inequality in science, medicine, and dentistry remains a central concern for the biomedical research workforce today. Although progress in areas of inclusivity and gender diversity was reported, growth has been slow. Women still face multiple challenges in reaching higher ranks and leadership positions while maintaining holistic success in these fields. Within dental research and academia, we might observe trends toward a more balanced pipeline. However, women continue to face barriers in seeking leadership roles and achieving economic equity and scholarship recognition. In an effort to evaluate the status of women in dental research and academia, the authors examined the role of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR), a global research organization, which has improved awareness on gender inequality. The goal of this article is to review five crucial issues of gender inequality in oral health research and academics-workforce pipeline, economic inequality, workplace harassment, gender bias in scholarly productivity, and work-life balance-and to discuss proactive steps that the IADR has taken to promote gender equality. Providing networking and training opportunities through effective mentoring and coaching for women researchers, the IADR has developed a robust pipeline of women leaders while promoting gender equality for women in dental academia through a culture shift.

Gender Bias Experiences of Female Surgical Trainees,Barnes K.L.; ; McGuire L.; Dunivan G.; Sussman A.L.; McKee R.,"Objective: Medical schools now average approximately 50% female students, yet a disproportionate number of women continue to choose nonsurgical over surgical specialties. Once in training, studies indicate that pervasive gender stereotypes, sexism and harassment negatively affect female surgeons. The aim of this study is to describe female surgeons' experiences with gender bias and microaggressions in the workplace during residency and fellowship training, and understand if differences exist in the experiences of trainees in male-dominant vs female-dominant surgical specialties. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A mixed methods approach was used to explore the experiences of female surgical trainees. Participants were recruited from all surgical disciplines at an academic center. Initially, focus groups were used to explore themes that trainees face related to gender bias. A trained moderator conducted all focus groups, which were audio recorded and transcribed. Qualitative analysis of de-identified transcripts was performed to identify emerging themes. We then created an online survey using the validated 44-question Sexist Microaggression Experiences and Stress Scale to assess frequency and psychologic impact of these events with additional questions developed from the focus groups. The survey was sent to all female residents and fellows at one academic institution. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): University of New Mexico Hospital, a tertiary care academic medical center. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Fifteen female surgical trainees participated in focus groups. Thirty-three female surgical trainees participated in the online survey. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Two focus groups including 15 female trainees were conducted, revealing 4 themes: Exclusion, Adaptation, Increased effort, and Development of Resilience Strategies. All participants had experienced gender bias or discrimination during medical school or surgical training. The quantitative survey had a 66% response rate (33/50 female trainees). Significant differences were found in the experience of female trainees in male-dominant vs female-dominant specialties, with those in male-dominant fields often reporting more frequent, severe, and stressful microaggression experiences. When describing how gender bias would affect their future in medicine, trainees in male-dominant specialties were more likely to report that due to gender bias, they ""may leave medicine/retire early"" (33% vs 6%, p = 0.040) and that they ""would not recommend my profession to trainees or family members"" (40% vs 6%, p = 0.015)."" <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female surgical trainees continue to experience gender bias. A culture of sexism leads to physical and social adaptations to fit into the role of surgeon. Participants expressed significant effort to sustain this level of adaptation, leading to fatigue and creation of resilience mechanisms. The environment in which a trainee operates (male-dominant vs female-dominant) significantly impacts their experience. Those experiencing more bias were less likely to recommend their specialty and reported plans to leave medicine earlier. Culture change across institutions and system-level interventions are necessary to create meaningful and sustainable change that improves the experience of female surgical trainees.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019",2019,/,Journal of Surgical Education,76,6,e1EP  - e14,2003283043,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2019.07.024,31601487,#574,Barnes 2019,"",""
Women in Cardiology in Australia-Are We Making Any Progress?,Segan L.; ; Vlachadis Castles A.,"Women remain largely under-represented in cardiology worldwide, despite gender parity among medical graduates. This is particularly notable in procedural subspecialties such as interventional cardiology and electrophysiology and is consistent at all levels of training. Cardiology continues to have the lowest proportion of females of all adult medicine specialties. This is a review of existing literature and statistics pertaining to women in cardiology and highlights the relative paucity of data or publications within Australia. Australian data from the Medical Training Review Panel reported that the proportion of females in cardiology advanced training (~22%) has not changed over the last 9 years and that there is a significant attrition as trainees progress through the various stages of training. In 2018, females represent only 16% of first year cardiology advanced trainees in Victoria and Tasmania. This represents a decrease from 20-25% in previous years. The factors affecting gender parity in cardiology are complex and diverse, from personal reasons such as family planning, work-life balance and perceived gender bias, to recruitment inertia and an imbalance in opportunities for career progression, research, financial remuneration and leadership positions. Worldwide, a number of initiatives have been explored to address the gender divide in cardiology, including networking and mentorship programs and Women in Cardiology working groups, dedicated to addressing the issue of female under-representation in cardiology. Unfortunately, the progress we are seeing worldwide is not being realised in Australia. A collaborative approach is essential to achieve gender parity in cardiology. This involves introspection and accountability by College bodies and policy changes committed to promoting workplace diversity by welcoming and retaining female talent.

Reports of biased behavior ranged from patient refusal of care and explicit racist, sexist, or homophobic remarks to belittling compliments or jokes. Targeted physicians reported an emotional toll that included exhaustion, self-doubt, and cynicism. Nontargeted bystanders reported moral distress and uncertainty about how to respond. Participant responses ranged from withdrawal from clinical role to a heightened determination to provide standard of care. Barriers to effective responses included lack of skills, insufficient support from senior colleagues and the institution, and perception of lack of utility associated with responding. Participants expressed a need for training on dealing with biased patients and for clear institutional policies to guide responses. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study of physicians and medical students, encounters with demeaning patients ranged from refusal of care to belittling jokes and were highly challenging and painful.

Sex Differences in Burnout and Barriers to Surgical Career Satisfaction,Lu P.; ; Fields A.C.; Columbus A.B.; Melnitchouk N.; Cho N.L.,"INTRODUCTION: Physician burnout is a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and perceived low personal accomplishment that affects up to 40% of surgeons. Burnout is associated with poor career satisfaction, and females are at higher risk of burnout compared with males. Here, we examined sex differences in drivers behind burnout and career dissatisfaction in surgical faculty. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Participants included full-time surgery faculty members at a single academic surgery center. Both male and female faculty members were included, at ranks ranging from instructor to associate professor. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by a faculty member at the institution until thematic saturation was reached. Notes were compiled from each interview, and these data were coded thematically. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Fourteen female faculty and 9 male faculty members were interviewed. For female faculty, the major theme of sex bias in the workplace was prominent. Male faculty struggled more than their female counterparts with guilt over complications and second victim syndrome. The majority of other themes, such as workflow inefficiencies, work-life balance, favoritism, lack of transparency from administration and leadership, and lack of community were shared between both female and male faculty members. Positive factors contributing to career satisfaction for both male and female faculty included rewarding patient care, appreciation, effective teams, work-life balance, educational interactions, mentorship, and clear work expectations. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Sex differences driving career dissatisfaction and burnout exist between female and male surgical faculty. Acknowledging these differences when designing efforts to address physician wellness and decrease burnout is critical.

Women in medicine mentoring and empowerment training program: A needs assessment and intervention in progress,Simone A.; ; Simone M.; Block L.; LaVine N.A.,"Needs and Objectives: Women face unique challenges throughout their careers as physicians, including disparities in salary and leadership positions. Interventions to address these issues have been made at the faculty level, however little has been done to address the same challenges for female residents. This is concerning, as many decisions determining career trajectory take place during residency. Thus, we conducted a needs assessment on gender in the workplace to establish a mentoring and empowerment training program to support female residents. Setting and Participants: A needs assessment survey was distributed amongst female internal medicine residents within the Northwell Health System. There residents were also the participants in our focus group and ongoing training program. Description: A targeted needs assessment, a combination of 3 validated surveys on workplace/gender culture, burnout and empowerment was sent to female residents. Surveys were sent to 60 female residents, and to date we have a 30% response rate. Preliminary Results show that 69% of respondents felt that women had fewer opportunities for professional development at work than men, 69% felt that men receive more organizational support than women, and 87% stated they would like to receive more support in the workplace. Data collection still is ongoing. These early Results reveal an opportunity to provide support and professional development to our female trainees. A focus group of five female trainees identified a need for a ""safe-space"" to discuss issues specific to being female residents. Participants identified desired topics, including negotiation, leading an effective team, work-life integration, public speaking, self-advocacy and addressing microaggressions and gender bias in the workplace. Based on this preliminary data, we developed a 6-session mentoring and empowerment training program for female internal medicine residents. Each session includes a learner-centered workshop on a topic from the focus group, and time for mentoring. Sessions are held at the hospital after working hours for ease of attendance. Evaluation: Three workshops have been held, with attendance ranging from 5-15 participants. Pre-and post-workshop surveys focused on perceived knowledge and comfort with topics covered will be given at each session, the Results of which are forthcoming. The needs assessment survey will be repeated at the end of the year to reassess participant's sense of support and opportunity for career advancement. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Our needs assessment shows a need amongst female residents for a place to receive support and career training. Our program provides a learner-centered, innovative way to provide this. Variability in attendance is attributed to variable resident schedules, and we plan to optimize schedules to enhance attendance going forward.",2019,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,34,2 Supplement,S865EP  - S866,629002932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11606.1525-1497,,#581,Simone 2019,"",""

Gender Equity and Career Advancement: Implications for Hospice and Palliative Medicine (TH352),Johnson K.S.; ; O'Mahony S.; Chen H.; Hingle S.; Moyer D.,"Objectives: *Describe disparities in the experience of female physicians compared to their male counterparts.*Describe specific challenges more commonly faced by female physicians and potential consequences with case examples.*Illustrate strategies for addressing gender disparities and promoting gender equity. Over the last 25 years, the proportion of physicians who are women has doubled from 17% to 36%. Furthermore, 46% of physicians in training and over half of U.S. medical students are women. While this significant increase in gender diversity has rapidly changed what the physician work force ""looks like"", there is a significant and persistent gap in the experience of female physicians. Compared to their male counterparts, studies show that female physicians are paid less across specialties and are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positons despite their increasing representation in the physician workforce. Women may also experience lack of mentorship, workplace discrimination, gender bias, sexual harassment and challenges related to work-life integration based on their roles outside of the workplace. While gender equity is a salient issue across all specialties, efforts to improve the experience of women are especially important to the field of hospice and palliative medicine where women make up two-thirds of the total workforce, 47% of physicians, and over 60% of HPM fellows in training-proportions considerably larger than in general physician workforce. Given the important contribution of women to the field of hospice and palliative medicine not only in terms of the volume of clinical care provided but also related to leadership, education, and research, addressing gender equity is essential to efforts to ensure that the field is able to meet the demands of the growing population of seriously ill patients and their families.

Characterizing gender-based differences in burnout among physicians in an academic medical center,Rotenstein L.; ; Harry E.; Wickner P.; Gupte A.; Neville B.; Lipsitz S.R.; Cullen E.; Rozenblum R.; Sequist T.D.; Dudley J.,"Background: Burnout, a syndrome that develops in response to chronic job-related stressors, is a critical issue affecting modern physicians. Burnout has negative effects on healthcare practice and workforce availability. We sought to characterize gender-based differences in burnout among physicians at an academic medical center and to understand contributors to burnout in this population. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In Spring 2017, an adaptation of the Stanford Physician Wellness Survey was administered to all clinical faculty (defined as actively practicing medicine) at Brigham and Women's Hospital, an academic medical center affiliated with Harvard Medical School. This survey was designed by the Physician Wellness Academic Consortium. It included validated measures of aggregate burnout (defined as a combination of emotional exhaustion and interpersonal disengagement) and professional fulfillment, as well as a single question on self-defined burnout. Demographics and data regarding previously characterized burnout drivers were also collected. Generalized estimating equations clustered by department (chi-squared or t-tests) were used to compare demographics, drivers, and outcomes between gender, while content analysis was used to analyze free-text comments. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Our population included 1,145 clinical faculty (610 (53.2%) men and 535 (46.8%) women; 65% response rate). A majority were under age 50. The largest departments represented were medicine (26.9%) and general surgery (10.6%). Female physicians were younger than male counterparts (p=0.02) and trended towards lower academic ranks (p=0.06). They were significantly more likely to report burnout than male physicians (227 (43.3%) vs. 199 (33.5%); p=0.02). This finding held for self-defined burnout (45.8% of females vs. 32.3% of males; p< 0.01). Female physicians were less likely to report professional fulfillment (183 (34.5%) vs. 298 (49.7%); p< 0.01). They had lower ratings of perceived appreciation (p< 0.01), schedule control (p< 0.01), work environment diversity (p=0.01), diversity and quality of departmental recruiting (p=0.02), and salary/benefits (p=0.02). Although there was not a difference in female vs. male physicians' intention to leave the institution within two years, females were more likely to report a departure would be driven by considerations around mentoring/leadership, schedule flexibility, workload expectations, and dual careers (all p< 0.05); qualitative analysis of free-text comments furthered these Conclusions. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female physicians practicing in an academic medical center experience higher levels of burnout and lower professional fulfillment than their male counterparts.

Month of birth effects on cognitive and psychological outcomes,Wang A.; ; Von Hinke S.,"It has long been established that month of birth (MoB) can have an effect on childhood and later life outcomes. A commonly discussed outcome is intelligence or academic achievement. Evidence suggests that this is due to school admissions cut-offs, with older individuals in a classroom tending to do better than younger ones. Using data from over 400,000 participants in UK Biobank, we explored MoB effects on cognition, as well as psychiatric and personality characteristics, using a family fixed effects methodology. We found that those born in June tend to spend less years in education, those born in September score higher in fluid intelligence while there were no month of birth effects for neuroticism and depressive symptoms. Sex differences were also observed. We looked to see if there are systematic genetic differences between those born in different months, using polygenic scores (PGS) for years of education and major depressive disorder. Our results showed that no such differences existed, adding support for the use of MoB as a proxy for environmental influences. Finally, we looked at the interaction between month of birth and genetic predispositions. We found no gene-environment interactions meaning that the effect of genetics is the same for those born in different months. However, we argue that genetic factors can compensate for negative month of birth effects. In addition to the school admissions explanation, we explore alternative explanations such as nutritional and weather effects in utero and in early life.",2019,/,Behavior Genetics,49,6,537EP  - 538,632791643,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10519-019-09973-8,,#585,Wang 2019,"",""

An International Survey of Female Dental Students' Perceptions About Gender Bias and Sexual Misconduct at Four Dental Schools,Ivanoff C.S.; ; Luan D.M.; Hottel T.L.; Andonov B.; Ricci Volpato L.E.; Kumar R.R.; Scarbecz M.,"As women enter the dental profession in increasing numbers in North America and around the world, the questions of how they perceive their environment and what kind of barriers they face are important subjects to be addressed. The aim of this study was to assess and compare women dental students' perceptions of bias in their environment and experiences of sexual misconduct at one dental school in each of four countries. In spring 2017, 1,293 female students at four dental schools in the U.S., Bulgaria, Brazil, and India were invited to participate in a 24-item survey developed by researchers from the four countries; 990 students responded (response rate 76.6%). The overall majority of the respondents reported thinking the admissions process at their school was fair (79.7%); but a fifth of U.S. and Brazilian students perceived their school was not fully embracing of females, with most Bulgarian students agreeing (87.2%) and all Indian students disagreeing. Most respondents overall perceived that male faculty members did not favor male students (79.5%) and did not think there was discrimination against female students by faculty (87.1%), but half of the U.S. respondents reported feeling discriminated against by both male faculty and male students. When the responses ""I've been verbally harassed"" and ""I've been somewhat verbally harassed"" were combined, 10.1% of the U.S. respondents reported verbal harassment, compared to 20% of Brazilian, 15% of Bulgarian, and 2% of Indian respondents.

The perceived organizational impact of the gender gap across a Canadian department of medicine and proposed strategies to combat it: A qualitative study,Pattani R.; ; Marquez C.; Dinyarian C.; Sharma M.; Bain J.; Moore J.E.; Straus S.E.,"Background: Despite the gender parity existing in medical schools for over three decades, women remain underrepresented in academic medical centers, particularly in senior ranks and in leadership roles. This has consequences for patient care, education, research, and workplace culture within healthcare organizations. This study was undertaken to explore the perspectives of faculty members at a single department of medicine on the impact of the existing gender gap on organizational effectiveness and workplace culture, and to identify systems-based strategies to mitigate the gap. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study took place at a large university department of medicine in Toronto, Canada, with six affiliated hospitals. In this qualitative study, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted between May and September 2016 with full-time faculty members who held clinical and university-based appointments. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three authors independently reviewed the transcripts to determine a preliminary list of codes and establish a coding framework. A modified audit consensus coding approach was applied; a single analyst reviewed all the transcripts and a second analyst audited 20% of the transcripts in each round of coding. Following each round, inter-rater reliability was determined, discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and modifications were made as needed to the coding framework. The analysis revealed faculty members' perceptions of the gender gap, potential contributing factors, organizational impacts, and possible solutions to bridge the gap. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 43 full-time faculty members who participated in the survey (29 of whom self-identified as female), most participants were aware of the existing gender gap within academic medicine.

However, the peer-reviewed literature suggests that effects may be smaller than reported, or mixed and depend on organisational context. For example, the beneficial association between female representation and performance may only hold for companies focused on innovation, which have inclusive cultures, or when identity group is unrelated to access to resources. There is limited high quality research investigating the effects of gender equity and diversity on research impact but the available evidence suggests there are benefits. Several studies report that increasing diversity of research collaborations is associated with publication in higher impact journals and more citations. There are also suggestions that more diverse teams may tackle different research questions, in particular prioritising women's health questions in a context where many historical trials have excluded women. As in the corporate setting, context may matter. For example, in one study gender-integrated teams with a higher proportion of highly educated women are more productive in disciplines with a greater female faculty representation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Recent calls for action to include gender in research impact assessment should be promoted and supported.

Safe Schools? Transgender Youth's School Experiences and Perceptions of School Climate,Day J.K.; ; Perez-Brumer A.; Russell S.T.,"The magnitude of gender identity-related disparities in school-based outcomes is unknown because of a lack of representative studies that include measures of gender identity.

Development of an innovative diversity and inclusion (D&I) educational program,Hackett A.N.; ; Kramer J.E.; Leonard S.R.; Scotellaro M.A.; Voigt B.L.; Silvestri J.M.; Spagnoli A.; Chubinskaya S.,"BACKGROUND: To provide high quality care, health systems must establish an atmosphere of respect for diverse cultural experiences, beliefs, and values. Building a healthcare team that reflects the culture of the community they serve is key to achieving this goal. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): To improve the culturally sensitive care of our patients, the Department of Pediatrics at Rush University Medical Center established a D&I Task Force. This team developed a multifaceted curriculum for faculty, residents, and staff with the goal that participants better appreciate their own biases and improve their cross-cultural sensitivity. Ultimately, we hope to improve the climate in our department around these issues, enabling us to recruit a more diverse workforce. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The curriculum includes three surveys: implicit bias, inter-cultural competency, and pre- and post-assessments of the departments cultural climate. A mandatory half day retreat is held with guest speakers discussing equity, inclusion, and crosscultural sensitivity. Thereafter, monthly interactive workshops are held on related topics (race, gender, disability, and sex discrimination, implicit bias, healthcare disparities, etc.). Attendance is monitored and CME credits are provided. Faculty who interview residency applicants participate in a role play session to raise cultural awareness and recognize bias. The program will be assessed annually via the climate survey to establish improvement and identify next steps. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The pre-program climate survey identified instances of bias experienced by departmental stakeholders. A post-retreat survey revealed a high level of satisfaction among participants. Each participant received an individual assessment of their culture survey.

Cumulative live birth rates after one ART cycle including all subsequent frozen-thaw cycles in 1050 women: Secondary outcome of an RCT comparing GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist protocols,Toftager M.; ; Bogstad J.; Lossl K.; Praetorius L.; Zedeler A.; Bryndorf T.; Nilas L.; Pinborg A.,"STUDY QUESTION: Are cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs) similar in GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist protocols for the first ART cycle including all subsequent frozen-thaw cycles from the same oocyte retrieval? SUMMARY ANSWER: The chances of at least one live birth following utilization of all fresh and frozen embryos after the first ART cycle are similar in GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist protocols. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Reproductive outcomes of ART treatment are traditionally reported as pregnancies per cycle or per embryo transfer. However, the primary concern is the overall chance of a live birth. After the first ART cycle with fresh embryo transfer, we found live birth rates (LBRs) of 22.8% and 23.8% (P = 0.70) for the GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist protocols, respectively. But with CLBRs including both fresh and frozen embryos from the first oocyte retrieval, chances of at least one live birth increases. There are no previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CLBRs in GnRH-antagonist versus GnRH-agonist protocols. Previous studies on CLBR are either retrospective cohort studies including multiple fresh cycles or RCTs comparing single embryo transfer (SET) with double embryo transfer (DET). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: CLBR was a secondary outcome in a Phase IV, dual-center, open-label, RCT including 1050 women allocated to a short GnRH-antagonist or a long GnRH-agonist protocol in a 1:1 ratio over a 5-year period using a web-based concealed randomization code. The minimum follow-up time from the first IVF cycle was 2 years. The aim was to compare CLBR between the two groups following utilization of all fresh and frozen embryos from the first ART cycle. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women referred for their first ART cycle at two public fertility clinics, <40 years of age were approached. A total of 1050 subjects were allocated to treatment and 1023 women started standardized ART protocols with recombinant human follitropin-beta (rFSH) stimulation. Day-2 SET was planned and additional embryos were frozen and used in subsequent frozen-thawed cycles. All pregnancies generated from oocyte retrieval during the first IVF cycle including fresh and frozen-thaw cycles were registered. Ongoing pregnancy was determined by ultrasonography at gestational week 7-9 and live birth was irrespective of the duration of gestation. CLBR was defined as at least one live birth per allocated woman after fresh and frozen cycles. Subjects were censored out after the first live birth. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the relative prognostic significance of female age, BMI, the number of retrieved oocytes and the diagnosis of infertility in relation to the CLBR. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Baseline characteristics were similar and equal proportions of patients continued with frozen-thaw (frozen embryo transfer, FET) cycles after their fresh ART cycle in the GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist arms. When combining all fresh and frozen-thaw embryo transfers from first oocyte retrieval with a minimum of 2-year follow-up, the CLBR was 34.1% (182/ 534) in the GnRH-antagonist group versus 31.2% (161/516) in the GnRH-agonist group (odds ratio (OR):1.14; 95% CI: 0.88-1.48, P = 0.32). Mean time to the first live birth was 11.0 months in the GnRH-antagonist group compared to 11.5 months in the GnRH-agonist group (P < 0.01). The total number of deliveries from all FET cycles where embryos were thawed were higher in the antagonist group 64/330 (19.4%) compared to the agonist group 43/355 (12.1%) ((OR): 1.74; 95% CI: 1.14-2.66, P = 0.01). The evaluation of prognostic factors showed that more retrieved oocytes were associated with a significantly higher CLBR in both treatment groups. For the subgroup of obese women (BMI >30 kg/m2), the CLBR was significantly higher in the GnRH-antagonist group (P = 0.02). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The duration of the trial is a possible limitation with introduction of new methods as 'Freeze all' and 'GnRH-agonist triggering', but as these treatments were used in only few women, a systematic bias is not likely. Blastocyst culture of surplus embryos for freezing was introduced to both groups simultaneously, thereby minimizing the risk of bias. Furthermore, with a minimum of 2-year follow-up, a minority (<1%) still had cryopreserved embryos and no live birth at the end of the trial. The post hoc prognostic covariate analyses with multiple strata should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the physicians were not blinded to GnRH treatment group after randomization. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: With the improvement of embryo culture, freezing and thawing methods as well as a strategy of elective SET, CLBR until first live birth provides an all-inclusive success rate for ART. When comparing GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist protocols, we find similar CLBRs, despite more oocytes being retrieved in the GnRH-agonist protocol.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author 2017.

Medical School Factors Associated with Changes in Implicit and Explicit Bias Against Gay and Lesbian People among 3492 Graduating Medical Students,Phelan S.M.; ; Burke S.E.; Hardeman R.R.; White R.O.; Przedworski J.; Dovidio J.F.; Perry S.P.; Plankey M.; A. Cunningham B.; Finstad D.; W. Yeazel M.; van Ryn M.,"Background: Implicit and explicit bias among providers can influence the quality of healthcare. Efforts to address sexual orientation bias in new physicians are hampered by a lack of knowledge of school factors that influence bias among students. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To determine whether medical school curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities predict bias among graduating students against gay and lesbian people. <ovid:br/>Design(s): Prospective cohort study. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): A sample of 4732 first-year medical students was recruited from a stratified random sample of 49 US medical schools in the fall of 2010 (81% response; 55% of eligible), of which 94.5% (4473) identified as heterosexual. Seventy-eight percent of baseline respondents (3492) completed a follow-up survey in their final semester (spring 2014). Main Measures: Medical school predictors included formal curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities. Outcomes were year 4 implicit and explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women, adjusted for bias at year 1. Key Results: In multivariate models, lower explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women was associated with more favorable contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients, and perceived skill and preparedness for providing care to LGBT patients. Greater explicit bias against lesbian women was associated with discrimination reported by sexual minority students (b = 1.43 [0.16, 2.71]; p = 0.03). Lower implicit sexual orientation bias was associated with more frequent contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients (b = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.01); p = 0.008). Greater implicit bias was associated with more faculty role modeling of discriminatory behavior (b = 0.34 [0.11, 0.57); p = 0.004). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Medical schools may reduce bias against sexual minority patients by reducing negative role modeling, improving the diversity climate, and improving student preparedness to care for this population.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017, Society of General Internal Medicine.",2017,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,32,11,1193EP  - 1201,617610326,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-017-4127-6,28766125,#597,Phelan 2017,"",""
The Fermi Paradox in STEM-Where Are the Women Leaders?,Daldrup-Link H.E.; ,"This commentary summarizes insights and discussions about the status of women leaders in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and medicine). While many academic institutions now train close to 50 % female students in STEM disciplines, there is a major underrepresentation of qualified women in leadership roles. Women are admitted to the basements of STEM institutions, but only few make it to the top floor. We see male superstars receiving well-deserved recognitions and advancements. Unfortunately, their female counterparts are often held back or cut down by both male and female colleagues. Increasing reports of acts of discrimination reported by women in STEM fields are a symptom. Unilateral hierarchy is the root cause. Just increasing the quote/proportion of women and underrepresented minorities at an institution is therefore not enough to address the underlying problem. At Stanford Radiology, we started a major initiative to increase the representation of qualified women and other underrepresented minorities in our leadership teams in order to ensure that every member of the Department has an advocate at the leadership table, when decisions are being made. Diverse leadership teams are vital to creating a culture of respect and inclusion for everyone.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017, World Molecular Imaging Society.",2017,/,Molecular Imaging and Biology,19,6,807EP  - 809,618364368,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-017-1124-4,28924727,#598,Daldrup-Link 2017,"",""
Training environments associated with presence and absence of medical student racial and gender clinical decision-making biases,Williams R.; ; Sussman A.; Getrich C.; Kano M.; Vasquez-Guzman C.E.; Boursaw B.; Krabbenhoft C.,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated the presence of racial and gender biases in practicing clinicians and the role these biases may play in health disparities. We found evidence of such biases in medical students in a previous survey of 4806 seniors from 84 medical schools, using clinical vignettes in which we varied the patient race and gender. We also noted variations in the presence or absence of these biases across schools. Our current research objective was to identify modifiable aspects of the medical school training environments that would reduce the likelihood of biases. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We conducted case studies of two clusters of medical schools, showing presence (7 schools) or absence (8 schools) of evidence of student biases in our earlier survey. During site visits to the 15 schools, we gathered quantitative and qualitative data on 24 attributes of training environments theorized to influence student attitudes, practice, or bias formation. Qualitative data were collected from key informant interviews of faculty, staff and students, and from focus groups of clinical level students. We analyzed the data using an iterative grounded hermenuetic editing approach, with five analysts identifying thematic structures. Concurrently, we used fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (FSCQA) to examine the data for multiple associations with the absence of evidence of biases. We focused our analysis on identifying feasible steps that schools could take to reduce biases. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Across the 15 schools, we interviewed 104 faculty and staff and 21 students and conducted 29 focus groups with 196 students. In the qualitative analysis, we found no attributes invariably distinguished training environments in the two clusters of schools. However, several factors were found more commonly in schools without evidence of student biases (e.g., longitudinal reflective small student groups, non-accusatory approach to training in cultural competency, etc.). The FSQCA showed that the presence of a longitudinal reflective component in the curriculum was sufficient, but not necessary to be associated with the schools without evidence of bias. Alternatively, FSQCA showed the presence (necessarily together) of attributes grouped into ""formal training"" (e.g., approach to diversity training) and ""school priorities"" (e.g., admissions preferences) or ""learning environment"" (e.g., faculty diversity) was sufficient to be associated with lack of evidence of biases. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Using two different analytic approaches, we found several potentially modifiable aspects of medical school training environments that are associated with schools whose students do not show evidence of racial and gender clinical decision-making biases. While the presence of a longitudinal reflective component in the curriculum was most strongly associated with lack of biases, several other approaches to formal and informal curriculum, communications and admissions processes were also associated with schools whose students did not exhibit biases.",2017,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,32,2 Supplement 1,S358,615581122,,,#600,Williams 2017,"",""
Understanding Students' Transition to High School: Demographic Variation and the Role of Supportive Relationships,Benner A.D.; ; Boyle A.E.; Bakhtiari F.,"The transition to high school is disruptive for many adolescents, yet little is known about the supportive relational processes that might attenuate the challenges students face as they move from middle to high school, particularly for students from more diverse backgrounds. Identifying potential buffers that protect youth across this critical educational transition is important for informing more effective support services for youth. In this study, we investigated how personal characteristics (gender, nativity, parent education level) and changes in support from family, friends, and school influenced changes in socioemotional adjustment and academic outcomes across the transition from middle to high school. The data were drawn from 252 students (50% females, 85% Latina/o). The results revealed declines in students' grades and increases in depressive symptoms and feelings of loneliness across the high school transition, with key variation by student nativity and gender. Additionally, stable/increasing friend support and school belonging were both linked to less socioemotional disruptions as students moved from middle to high school. Increasing/stable school belonging was also linked to increases in school engagement across the high school transition. These findings suggest that when high school transitions disrupt supportive relationships with important others in adolescents' lives, adolescents' socioemotional well-being and, to a lesser extent, their academic engagement are also compromised. Thus, in designing transition support activities, particularly for schools serving more low-income and race/ethnic minority youth, such efforts should strive to acclimate new high school students by providing inclusive, caring environments and positive connections with educators and peers.",2017,/,Journal of youth and adolescence,46,10,2129EP  - 2142,622373939,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-017-0716-2,28776119,#601,Benner 2017,"",""
Evaluation of a workshop intervention to reduce racial bias in internal medicine residents' clinical decision-making,Stahr A.; ; Kaatz A.; Alexander L.; Filut A.; Her Y.; Pankey T.; Carnes M.; Kolehmainen C.J.,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Despite evidence implicating the role of implicit bias in the perpetuation of health disparities and hindrance of workplace diversity and equity, existing approaches to bias reduction demonstrate little success. Failing to provide physicians with the knowledge, language, and strategies to supportmeaningful behavior change may thwart progress towards a more culturally responsive healthcare system. The ""Breaking the Bias Habit"" workshop is a behaviorally-informed approach to reducing implicit bias for internal medicine (IM) residents. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which workshop intervention can reduce race bias in IM residents' clinical decision making. Towards this, we have 1) adapted and piloted an evidence based gender bias habit-breaking workshop to address race and other stereotype-based bias, and target IM residents; and 2) we have developed case vignettes and survey questions to assess the extent to which the workshop reduces race bias and increases knowledge and awareness of content presented in the workshop. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The workshop will be offered to January and February 2017 as part of the standard curriculum at the University of Wisconsin-Madison IM Residency Program. We will ask for volunteers to complete clinical vignettes and a questionnaire probing racial bias before the workshop, immediately after and at one additional distal time point. DESCRIPTION: The bias habit-breaking workshop is composed of an introduction and three modules. Each module incorporates content and interactive elements that come from research on cognitive and behavioral change, and adult education. EVALUATION: Clinical vignettes have been used as a surrogate for clinical interactions in multiple studies with mixed results in their ability to detect bias in clinical decision-making. For this study we created new vignettes and established their content validity with a modified Delphi procedure with seven experts on stereotype-based bias, including two internists. Following vignettes, participants complete four sets of measures probing: 1) how they would treat/ care for the patient; 2) feelings and behavior they might direct towards vignette patients, measured with psychometric ""should/would"" scales (previously used to show discrepancy between what a person thinks they should do and what they would do-with a larger discrepancy indicating greater bias; construct validity has been established for these scales, and will use results from both studies to test reliability); 3) proximal measures of behavioral change evaluating awareness, motivation, self-efficacy, outcome expectation and actions; and 4) explicit racial bias temperature scales. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: We expect our results to show some degree of bias in internal medicine residents and hypothesize our workshop will reduce bias in clinical decision making to some degree.

Gender equality at all faculty levels has long been a top priority for institutional leaders and visionaries, and yet, the percentage of women at higher faculty ranks continues to lag, which is striking given that women have comprised at least 40 percent of medical school classes over the past two decades, suggesting that the dearth of women leaders is not a ""pipeline"" problem. There have been enough women in medical school classes to translate to equal numbers at the top. Women physicians face barriers to career progression and are under-represented at senior levels.

Diversity Matters in Academic Radiology: Acknowledging and Addressing Unconscious Bias,Allen B.J.; ; Garg K.,"To meet challenges related to changing demographics, and to optimize the promise of diversity, radiologists must bridge the gap between numbers of women and historically underrepresented minorities in radiology and radiation oncology as contrasted with other medical specialties. Research reveals multiple ways that women and underrepresented minorities can benefit radiology education, research, and practice. To achieve those benefits, promising practices promote developing and implementing strategies that support diversity as an institutional priority and cultivate shared responsibility among all members to create inclusive learning and workplace environments. Strategies also include providing professional development to empower and equip members to accomplish diversity-related goals. Among topics for professional development about diversity, unconscious bias has shown positive results. Unconscious bias refers to ways humans unknowingly draw upon assumptions about individuals and groups to make decisions about them. Researchers have documented unconscious bias in a variety of contexts and professions, including health care, in which they have studied differential treatment, diagnosis, prescribed care, patient well-being and compliance, physician-patient interactions, clinical decision making, and medical school education. These studies demonstrate unfavorable impacts on members of underrepresented groups and women. Learning about and striving to counteract unconscious bias points to promising practices for increasing the numbers of women and underrepresented minorities in the radiology and radiation oncology workforce.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 American College of Radiology",2016,/,Journal of the American College of Radiology,13,12,1426EP  - 1432,615035529,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2016.08.016,27916109,#604,Allen 2016,"",""

Toward diversity-responsive medical education: taking an intersectionality-based approach to a curriculum evaluation,Muntinga M.E.; ; Krajenbrink V.Q.; Peerdeman S.M.; Croiset G.; Verdonk P.,"Recent years have seen a rise in the efforts to implement diversity topics into medical education, using either a 'narrow' or a 'broad' definition of culture. These developments urge that outcomes of such efforts are systematically evaluated by mapping the curriculum for diversity-responsive content. This study was aimed at using an intersectionality-based approach to define diversity-related learning objectives and to evaluate how biomedical and sociocultural aspects of diversity were integrated into a medical curriculum in the Netherlands. We took a three-phase mixed methods approach. In phase one and two, we defined essential learning objectives based on qualitative interviews with school stakeholders and diversity literature. In phase three, we screened the written curriculum for diversity content (culture, sex/gender and class) and related the results to learning objectives defined in phase two. We identified learning objectives in three areas of education (medical knowledge and skills, patient-physician communication, and reflexivity). Most diversity content pertained to biomedical knowledge and skills. Limited attention was paid to sociocultural issues as determinants of health and healthcare use. Intersections of culture, sex/gender and class remained mostly unaddressed. The curriculum's diversity-responsiveness could be improved by an operationalization of diversity that goes beyond biomedical traits of assumed homogeneous social groups. Future efforts to take an intersectionality-based approach to curriculum evaluations should include categories of difference other than culture, sex/gender and class as separate, equally important patient identities or groups.",2016,/,Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,21,3,541EP  - 559,617450794,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10459-015-9650-9,26603884,#606,Muntinga 2016,"",""
Dissecting the voice: Health professions students' perceptions of instructor age and gender in an online environment and the impact on evaluations for faculty,Doubleday A.F.; ; Lee L.M.,"Gender and age bias is well-documented in academia with many studies demonstrating bias in students' evaluations of instructors. Failure of an instructor to meet gender or age-based expectations can translate to lower scores or negative comments on evaluations. While there is some evidence of bias in students' evaluations of online instructors, current studies have not fully examined the relationship between bias and instructor vocal characteristics. First-year dental students at two institutions were randomly assigned one of four videos on spinal cord anatomy to view. Videos contained identical content but were narrated by individuals of different gender and age (younger man, younger woman, older man, older woman). Students completed a content-based prequiz, watched the video, completed a postquiz, and answered a questionnaire evaluating the video and instructor. Students at Institution A rated the younger man and younger woman highest for nearly every evaluation category. At Institution B students rated the older man and younger woman highest. Results reveal that the older woman's voice received the lowest rankings for nearly every question in both samples. This report confirms the presence of gender and age bias in student evaluations of instructors in an online environment and demonstrates that bias may surface in response to vocal characteristics. Bias may impact older women more significantly than other groups. Differences in results from Institution A and Institution B suggest that factors affecting student perceptions of instructors, and the roles that gender and age bias may play in student evaluations, are complex and may be contextual.

Legal and human rights dimensions of HIV and STI: Historical background and policy implications,Caceres C.; ,"The degree of regulation of sexuality has been very diverse through times and cultures. Christianity regulated it heavily, and many of its views became part of the European legal tradition. The last thirty years have seen considerable changes in Western culture, including the emergence of social movements around gender equity, sexual diversity, and HIV. In connection with the struggles of these movements as well as other social and political changes, there has been considerable progress in the situation of women and people with non-heterosexual identities, although in this case there has been a greater range of changes, including some on the negative side, such as criminalization. Finally, the global HIV movement made significant changes in the relationship between scientists, doctors, community and regulatory agencies, and led a crusade to expand access to treatment and prevention. Because HIV is primarily sexually transmitted, and more prevalent in socially excluded groups in countries without generalized epidemics, AIDS was doubly stigmatized: as a deadly and mysterious disease, and as an indicator of social exclusion. Predictably, HIV stigma led to discrimination in access to services. In most of the world, the promotion of condom use did reduce, but never eliminated HIV transmission. Such finding brought a focus both to cultural differences and to structural vulnerability. HIV is clearly more frequent among socially excluded people, who need public interventions to reduce such vulnerability. In its history of more than three decades, HIV has elicited a variety of responses in legislative and regulatory frameworks, both positive and negative, some of which will be discussed.

The authors implemented a pair-matched, single-blind, cluster randomized, controlled study of a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention at a large public university., METHOD: Participants were faculty in 92 departments or divisions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Between September 2010 and March 2012, experimental departments were offered a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention as a 2.5-hour workshop. Surveys measured gender bias awareness; motivation, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations to reduce bias; and gender equity action. A timed word categorization task measured implicit gender/leadership bias. Faculty completed a work-life survey before and after all experimental departments received the intervention. Control departments were offered workshops after data were collected., RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly greater changes post intervention for faculty in experimental versus control departments on several outcome measures, including self-efficacy to engage in gender-equity-promoting behaviors (P = .013). When >= 25% of a department's faculty attended the workshop (26 of 46 departments), significant increases in self-reported action to promote gender equity occurred at three months (P = .007). Post intervention, faculty in experimental departments expressed greater perceptions of fit (P = .024), valuing of their research (P = .019), and comfort in raising personal and professional conflicts (P = .025)., CONCLUSIONS: An intervention that facilitates intentional behavioral change can help faculty break the gender bias habit and change department climate in ways that should support the career advancement of women in academic medicine, science, and engineering.",2015,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,90,2,221EP  - 230,613762794,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000000552,25374039,#611,Carnes 2015,"",""
A 12-year comparison of students' perspectives on diversity at a Jesuit Medical School,Mujawar I.; ; Sabatino M.; Ray Mitchell S.; Walker B.; Weissinger P.; Plankey M.,"Many studies have assessed perspectives of medical students toward institutional diversity, but few of them have attempted to map changes in diversity climate over time. This study aims to investigate changes in diversity climate at a Jesuit medical institution over a 12-year period. In 1999, 334 medical students completed an anonymous self-administered online survey, and 12 years later, 406 students completed a comparable survey in 2011. Chi-square tests assessed the differences in percent responses to questions of the two surveys, related to three identities: gender, race, and sexual orientation. The 1999 versus 2011 samples were 46% versus 49% female, 61% versus 61% Caucasian, and 41% vs. 39% aged 25 years or older. Findings suggested improvements in medical students' perceptions surrounding equality 'in general' across the three identities (p<0.001); 'in the practice of medicine' based on gender (p<0.001), race/ethnicity (p=0.60), and sexual orientation (p=0.43); as well as in the medical school curriculum, including course text content, professor's delivery and student-faculty interaction (p<0.001) across the three identities. There was a statistically significant decrease in experienced or witnessed events related to gender bias (p<0.001) from 1999 to 2011; however, reported events of bias based on race/ethnicity (p=0.69) and sexual orientation (p=0.58) only showed small decreases. It may be postulated that the improvement in students' self-perceptions of equality and diversity over the past 12 years may have been influenced by a generational acceptance of cultural diversity and, the inclusion of diversity training courses within the medical curriculum. Diversity training related to race and sexual orientation should be expanded, including a follow-up survey to assess the effectiveness of any intervention.",2014,/,Medical education online,19,"(Mujawar) Department of Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.(Sabatino, Ray Mitchell, Walker, Weissinger) Office of the Dean for Medical Education, School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.(Plankey) Dep",23401,373968478,,24581334,#612,Mujawar 2014,"",""
