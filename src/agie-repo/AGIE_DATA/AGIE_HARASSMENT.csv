Adolescence Does Not Divert Sex Offending Adolescents of Color from Criminal Legal System Involvement.,Stevenson MC; Picot CR; Rivers MA,"After the United States Civil War, during Reconstruction, Southern states targeted Black youth and men for incarceration and forced labor, often charging them with rape, spawning the Black male rapist myth. This study explores evidence of a Reconstruction-era ethos in present-day treatment of youth of color accused of sexual assault. Specifically, we examined effects of perpetrator age and race on legal outcomes in 382 alleged child sexual abuse cases. There were 291 adult perpetrators (91% men, M age = 34; 76% White, 20% Black, 2% biracial, 2% Latinx, and 1% Asian) and 91 adolescent perpetrators (96% boys, M age = 14; 73% White, 22% Black, 4% biracial, and 1% Latinx). Supporting hypotheses, adolescent (vs. adult) perpetrators were less frequently arrested or referred for prosecution-but only when they were White. In contrast, for perpetrators of color, being an adolescent (vs. an adult) did not reduce arrest or prosecutorial referral likelihood. Additionally, cases involving adolescents of color (vs. White adolescents) were more immediately criminally investigated. Thus, youthfulness does not proffer protection from criminal legal system involvement for adolescents of color accused of sex offending-evidence of modern and persistent racism rooted in a nation's past.",2025,Jan,Child Maltreat,,,10775595251314173,,10.1177/10775595251314173,39813687,#1,Stevenson 2025,"",""
"Sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault in UK radiology training: a national survey.",Robinson E; Singhal P; Loughborough W; Little D,"AIM: Sex discrimination and sexual misconduct are endemic issues within the National Health Service (NHS). The extent of the problem amongst radiology registrars across the UK is unknown. This national survey explores the experiences of radiology registrars in relation to sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault during radiology training, in addition to the impact on wellbeing and barriers to reporting behaviours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study using qualitative data from distribution of a national survey with ethical approval. RESULTS: 122 responses were received. A significantly increased proportion of females have witnessed or experienced sex discrimination and sexual harassment compared to males (p < 0.05). A greater proportion of females also experienced sexual assault however the numbers are low and not statistically significant. The majority of perpetrators (58%) were senior colleagues both from within and outside of the radiology team (including radiology supervisors). 21% of perpetrators were patients. 72% of radiology registrars who experienced sex discrimination, harassment and/or assault were not happy with the way in which their situation was dealt with. 68% were not aware of a pathway in place for reporting such behaviours. CONCLUSION: Sex discrimination and sexual harassment and assault have been experienced widely by radiology registrars, disproportionately affecting women. There are significant barriers to reporting these issues especially given most perpetrators are senior colleagues. We call upon responsible organisations to create a safe working environment for all, including implementing new pathways for reporting, developing training, and considering safety measures such as enhanced use of chaperones.",2025,Jan,Clin Radiol,80,,106717,,10.1016/j.crad.2024.09.023,39504891,#2,Robinson 2025,"",""

An updated examination of gender differences in sexual harassment perception: A meta-analysis and a survey study.,Zhou Y; Nguyen HD; Revier MS; Krueger KR; Sackett PR,"Twenty years ago, Rotundo et al. (2001) meta-analyzed the gender differences in sexual harassment (SH) perception. They found an overall d of 0.30: Women are more likely than men to label certain behaviors as SH. Much has changed since then, including the increased social awareness and the prevalence of SH training. Given the prevalence of SH in the workplace and the importance of SH perception in SH research, we conducted a mixed-methods research program to explore possible changes in the gender gap. In Study 1 (k = 72, N = 27,767), we meta-analyzed the perceptual gender differences to compare with those in Rotundo et al. and examined several moderators of the differences. We found an overall mean d of 0.33, implying a similar gender gap in SH perception as 20 years ago, yet none of the moderators examined in this study showed significant results. In Study 2, we empirically examined gender differences in mean levels of SH perception using the same measurement scales used in two older studies and compared with the differences found in these two studies. We found higher levels of SH perception for both men and women, but no difference in the mean d between men and women, suggesting that no change over time in mean d does not mean no change in SH perception. The implications of our findings are discussed.

State-level structural sexism and adolescent sexual violence victimization in the US.,Lee H,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent sexual violence victimization is a significant public health issue in the United States. Structural sexism, a form of gender inequality at the societal level, may play a crucial role in influencing the prevalence of sexual violence victimization among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the association between state-level structural sexism and sexual violence victimization among adolescents and to explore how this relationship varies between male and female adolescents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data was derived from a nationally representative sample of high school students in grades 9-12 across the United States who participated in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) in 2017 and 2019. METHODS: A state-level structural sexism index was created from nine different items to reflect the multidimensional nature of structural sexism. This study employs multi-level regression analysis to investigate the impact of state-level structural sexism on three types of sexual violence victimization: sexual violence, sexual dating violence, and physical dating violence. RESULTS: This study revealed a significant interaction between structural sexism and gender. In states with higher levels of structural sexism, female adolescents reported increased likelihood of sexual violence (β = 0.013, p < .001), sexual dating violence (β = 0.006, p < .001), and physical dating violence (β = 0.006, p < .001) compared to males. Conversely, male adolescents in these states reported lower rates of victimization. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the role of structural sexism in influencing sexual violence victimization among adolescents. Addressing structural sexism may be essential in mitigating the risk of sexual violence victimization, especially for female adolescents.",2024,Dec,Child Abuse Negl,158,,107096,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.107096,39423595,#5,Lee 2024,"",""
"Association between adverse childhood experiences and obesity, and sex differences: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",Zhou Y; Sun Y; Pan Y; Dai Y; Xiao Y; Yu Y,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is one of the most common health problems worldwide. Although studies have reported associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and obesity, specific subtype associations and sex differences are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the association between ACEs and adult obesity risk and sex differences. METHODS: Five databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PsycINFO, were searched with a June 10, 2024 deadline. Included studies investigated the association between at least one ACE and obesity. Two researchers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and its adaptations and extracted relevant characteristics and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 17.0, including random effects models, heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses, publication bias assessments, Meta-regression analyses, and subgroup analyses. Dose-response analyses revealed potential trends between different levels of abuse and risk of obesity. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 46 studies and showed a notable increased risk of obesity in adults experiencing ACEs (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.38-1.59). Subgroup analyses showed significantly increased risk in Europe and North America, with significant increases observed in both developed and developing countries. Prospective, retrospective, and cross-sectional studies showed strong associations. Different types of ACEs (physical, sexual, psychological, and non-physical, psychological, or sexual abuse) were linked to a higher obesity risk. Sex difference analyses showed that females faced a greater risk when experiencing physical (OR: 1.606), sexual (OR: 1.581), and non-physical, psychological, or sexual (OR: 1.319) abuse; males exhibited increased risk only with non-physical, psychological, or sexual abuse (OR: 1.240). Dose-response analyses indicated that a higher number of ACEs was associated with an increased risk of obesity in adults. CONCLUSIONS: ACEs significantly increase the risk of adult obesity, with consistent findings across geographic regions, levels of economic development, and types of study design. Sex difference analysis indicates that females are particularly affected. Future research should prioritize including studies from underrepresented geographic areas to enhance understanding of the global impact of ACEs on obesity risk. Additionally, strengthening child protection and intervention efforts is crucial to mitigate the adverse effects of ACEs on adult health.",2024,Dec,J Psychiatr Res,180,,56-67,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.09.042,39378571,#6,Zhou 2024,"",""
Prevalence of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms among the Icelandic population: gender and regional differences.,Einarsdottir TS; Asgeirsdottir BB; Sigurvinsdottir R; Ullman SE; Gudmundsdottir B,"AIM: The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to provide descriptive data about the lifetime prevalence of trauma exposure with a particular focus on sexual violence and natural disasters and to assess the prevalence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the Icelandic population. In addition, the aim was to investigate whether PTSD symptoms, trauma types and prevalence differed by gender and geographical location. METHOD: A representative sample of the population between the ages of 18 and 80 years was randomly selected from the Icelandic National Registrar. The study included a total of 1766 participants consisting of 930 (52.7%) women and 836 (47.3%) men, with an overall mean age of 49.9 years (standard deviation 16.1). Participants were contacted by phone and asked questions from the Lifetime Events Checklist (LEC-5) to assess lifetime exposure to traumatic events. Individuals who had experienced traumatic events completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) to assess PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Exposure to trauma is common among the Icelandic population, with 84.3% of the participants experiencing at least one kind of trauma. Of those exposed to trauma, 10.5% fulfilled criteria indicating a higher risk of PTSD. The prevalence of sexual violence and other unwanted sexual experiences was relatively high (16.2% and 24.4%, respectively) compared with other national studies. Women were almost four times more likely than men to have been exposed to sexual violence (24.9% vs 6.4%), and were more likely to have been exposed to other unwanted sexual experience (35.1% vs 12.4%, respectively). Exposure to natural disasters is frequent but with great geographical variation.

"Key mental health differences in conflict-related sexual violence and how sex, severity, and early intervention impact on improvement: a retrospective observational study.",Martínez Torre S; Sordo L; Sagrado Benito MJ; Llosa AE; Carrascal Maldonado A; Dazang Umar R; Usman J; Carreño Glaría C,"BACKGROUND: Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is a significant health and human rights issue in humanitarian contexts, but there is a need of further research on differences between sexes in terms of severity of symptoms and improvement. Consequently, we explored the differences in severity and outcomes among male and female survivors of CRSV who received mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in an armed conflict setting. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed medical records from 3442 CRSV survivors in a MHPSS programme in Borno State, Nigeria, between 2018 and 2019. Patient characteristics, severity (measured with Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale [CGI-S scale]), and improvement (measured with Clinical Global Impression of improvement [CGI-I] scale) were assessed by an attending counsellor. We assessed predictors for severity and improvement using a multivariable logistic regression analysis and time to improvement by sex using Kaplan Meier (K-M) curves and Cox regression. RESULTS: We included 3442 patients who had at least one CRSV event in this study (2955 [85.9%] female, 486 [14.1%] male, one unknown). The most prevalent categories of symptoms were depression (49.9%; n = 1716), post-traumatic (25.6%; n = 879), and anxiety (20.3%; n = 697) symptoms. Most patients had mild (59.0%; n = 1869/3170) or moderate (36.4%; n = 1153/3170) symptoms at baseline, with 4.7% having severe symptoms (n = 148/3170). The logistic regression analysis (n = 1106), showed male patients had a 59% higher odds of severe symptoms at baseline than female patients (aOR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04-2.45). Among males, those older than 55 years had three times higher odds of presenting severe symptoms than younger patients (aOR 3.65; 95% CI 1.43-9.34). Women aged 36-55 years were more likely to present improvement than younger female patients (aOR 1.32; 95% CI 1.11-1.58). For both sexes, prompt attention after a CRSV event (≤ 3 days) positively predicted improvement (aOR 13.9; 95% CI 1.48-130 males, aOR 2.11; 95% CI 1.22-3.64 females) compared to late attention. Time to improvement did not differ between sexes, with an average of at least three consultations needed to achieve improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that psychological attention of survivors within the first 72 h should be a priority. MHPSS programmes addressing CRSV should be inclusive to all patients, and gender-neutral approaches to ensure access, safety, confidentiality, and non-discrimination for all survivors should be developed.",2024,Oct,Confl Health,18,1,61,,10.1186/s13031-024-00620-6,39415274,#8,MartínezTorre 2024,"",""

Gender Differences in Sexual Violence Victimization Experiences and Validity of Victimization Reports: A Think-Aloud Study.,Jeffrey NK; Senn CY,"This study compared the qualitative nature of women and men's sexual violence (SV) victimization, the types of experiences captured and missed on the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV) across genders, and common interpretations of the SES-SFV items. Fifty-four university students (31 women, 21 cis men, 2 trans men) who had recent unwanted (but not necessarily nonconsensual) sexual experiences thought out loud while privately completing the SES-SFV. They also typed descriptions of experiences reported on SES-SFV items or similar experiences when nothing was reported on an item. Results indicated that women's victimization was more frequent and severe than cis men's, except when men were victimized by men. Although verbal coercion was common across genders, event descriptions indicated that women's verbal coercion experiences were more often harsh and part of a partner's ongoing SV or coercive control. The findings suggest that quantitative measurement can mask important gender differences in victimization and (based on analysis of false positives and negatives) may underestimate rape and attempted rape experiences, especially women's. Findings suggested that responding to the SES-SFV was not traumatic or distressing.

Giving Women the Benefit of the Doubt?

Accordingly, gender-based examinations of schools' management of sexual allegations are lacking. We address this gap by drawing on a unique administrative dataset from an Australian jurisdiction that captures alleged improper sexual conduct by educational employees. We compare 809 female- and male-perpetrated cases reported between 2015 and 2019 with respect to event, location, victim, and perpetrator characteristics, as well as the ensuing risk management strategies and sanctions. Compared to men, reported women were younger, employed on more secure employment arrangements, and less often had a relevant discipline history. Most alleged event characteristics did not significantly differ based on perpetrator gender. Women's alleged perpetration, however, more often occurred in places external to school and involved more serious sexual victimization of comparatively older male students. After controlling for event, victim, perpetrator, and allegation characteristics there was nearly no support for a gender bias in institutional responses. However, a lack of any action was more often observed in female-perpetrated cases under very specific and limited conditions.

Previous studies have confirmed this relationship; however, there is a lack of research on the disease burden of AUD attributable to CSA. OBJECTIVE: To analyze global spatiotemporal trends and differences in the disease burden of AUD attributable to CSA and its relationship with age, sex, and the sociodemographic index (SDI). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Public Database. METHODS: Summary exposure value (SEV) was used to evaluate CSA. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY), years lived with disability (YLD), years of life lost (YLL), and their annual rates of change were used to evaluate disease burden. Cluster analysis based on Ward's method was used to examine the global burden associated with age, sex, and SDI. A 95 % uncertainty intervals (UI), excluding 0, was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In 2019, 1.63 million (95 % UI 0.23-3.90 million) DALYs of AUD were caused by CSA and the age-standardized rates (ASRs) of DALY was 19.77 (95 % UI 2.78-47.46) globally. Annual rates of change in DALY of people over 65 years of age increased from 1990 to 2019 in all regions except the High-middle SDI regions.

Evaluating layperson interpretation of actuarial sexual violence risk data: A multi-method comparison of risk communication with attention to gender bias.,Coaker LC; Batastini AB; Davis RM; Lester ME,"Forensic clinicians are often called upon to help courts determine the likelihood that someone will continue to commit sexually violent acts in the future. The utility of these evaluations depends largely on how effectively the results are communicated to and understood by the trier of fact. Actuarial results, such as those commonly reported in sexual offense risk assessments, appear particularly challenging for laypersons to understand. Using a representative sample of 206 U.S. adults, this study examines three methods of communicating actuarial risk via simulated expert testimony on participants' ratings of a hypothetical evaluee's risk of sexual re-offending. The results suggested that all participants, regardless of how results were communicated, over-estimated the examinee's risk level relative to the expert's probabilistic findings, but tended to agree with the expert's categorical predictions. Participants who were only shown actuarial data consistently rated the evaluee as more dangerous and likely to commit future sexually violent acts.

"The Association Between Sexual Violence and Suicidal Ideation Among Transgender Women and the Role of Gender-Affirming Healthcare Providers in Seven Urban Areas in the United States, 2019 to 2020.",Eustaquio PC; Olansky E; Lee K; Marcus R; Cha S,"Transgender women are disproportionately affected by sexual violence and corresponding mental health sequelae; however, many do not access healthcare due to experiences with transphobia. This analysis evaluated the association between sexual violence and suicidal ideation and the moderating effect of having a healthcare provider (HCP) with whom transgender women were comfortable discussing gender-related issues (""gender-affirming HCP""). We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance among Transgender Women (NHBS-Trans). Transgender women were recruited using respondent-driven sampling from seven urban areas from 2019 to 2020 and participated in an HIV biobehavioral survey. This analysis was restricted to transgender women who visited a HCP in the past 12 months (""healthcare-seeking transgender women"" [HSTW]) (N = 1,489).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A Dutch observational population-based cross-sectional study was used, based on self-administered questionnaires. Respondents were included if they had answered all questions about abuse and LUTS. Logistic regression was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Included were 558 men and 790 women, of whom 29% and 37%, respectively, reported a history of one of more types of abuse. Abuse was significantly associated with LUTS in both men (odds ratio [OR] 1.7; 1.2-2.5) and women (OR 1.4; 1.1-2.1). This association, testing by two-way interaction, was significantly stronger in men. No association was found between childhood abuse or adulthood abuse and LUTS, in men or women. The association of sexual abuse with LUTS was significant in both men (2.7; 1.4-5.2) and in women (1.5; 1.1-2.2), and this association (testing by two-way interaction) was significantly much stronger in men. CONCLUSION: In men more than in women, a history of any type of abuse is associated with LUTS, regardless of whether the abuse occurred during childhood or adulthood. In both sexes, a history of sexual abuse is also associated with experiencing LUTS, with a much stronger association in men than in women.

Multivariable multilevel models tested gender and sexual behavior differences in SV history; recognition of SV; prevention behaviors (self-efficacy to obtain sexual consent, intentions to intervene, positive bystander behaviors); and care-seeking behaviors (knowledge of, self-efficacy to use, and actual use of SV services). Adjusting for lifetime exposure to SV, compared with cisgender men, cisgender women had higher recognition of SV and reproductive coercion, prevention behaviors, and care-seeking self-efficacy (beta range 0.19-1.36) and gender minority people had higher recognition of SV and intentions to intervene (beta range 0.33-0.61). Cisgender men with any same-gender sexual partners had higher SV knowledge (beta = 0.23) and self-efficacy to use SV services (beta = 0.52) than cisgender men with only opposite-gender partners. SV history did not explain these differences. Populations most vulnerable to SV generally have higher SV knowledge, prevention behaviors, and care-seeking behaviors than cisgender men with only opposite-gender sexual partners. Innovative SV intervention approaches are necessary to increase SV-related knowledge among heterosexual cisgender men and may need to target alternative mechanisms to effectively reduce inequities for sexual and gender minority people.",2024,May,Prev Sci,25,4,590-602,,10.1007/s11121-023-01640-z,38214789,#19,CoulterRWS 2024,"",""
"Sexual harassment and implicit gender-career biases negatively impact women's life expectancy in the US: a state-level analysis, 2011-2019.",Cunningham GB; Wicker P,"BACKGROUND: Despite some gains, women continue to have less access to work and poorer experiences in the workplace, relative to men. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among women's life expectancy and two work-related factors, sexual harassment and gender-career biases. METHOD: We examined the associations at the state level of analysis (and District of Columbia) in the US from 2011 to 2019 (n = 459) using archival data from various sources. Measures of the ratio of population to primary health providers, year, the percent of adults who are uninsured, the percent of residents aged 65 or older, and percent of residents who are Non-Hispanic White all served as controls. RESULTS: Results of linear regression models showed that, after accounting for the controls, sexual harassment and gender-career biases among people in the state held significant, negative associations with women's life expectancy.

Examining medical students' experience of gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment from clinical teachers at a UK medical school.,Skan O; Tregidgo L; Tizzard J; Westlake I; Joji N,"PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: To quantify the prevalence and characterise the nature of gender-based discrimination (GBD) and sexual harassment (SH) arising from clinical teachers towards medical students at one UK medical school. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed quantitative and qualitative survey of medical students. Chi-squared analysis and logistic regression was performed on quantitative data, while an inductive thematic analysis of qualitative data was undertaken. These findings were compared to look for common patterns. RESULTS: Females were significantly more likely to report experiencing both GBD (χ(2) = 38.61, p < 0.0001) and SH (χ(2) = 19.53, p < 0.0001) than males (OR = 10.45 (CI 4.84 - 22.56, p < 0.0001)). These behaviours were more likely to be reported in specific surgical placements than medical placements (χ(2) = 15.06, p < 0.001 and χ(2) = 5.90, p < 0.05). Perpetrators were more commonly male, and more commonly consultants. Exposure to GBD or SH was significantly more likely to affect the choice of specialty in females compared to males (χ(2) = 11.17, p < 0.001). Students noted a casual use of sexist language, inappropriate sexual advances, and gender-based microaggressions which create a pervasive discrepancy in educational opportunities between genders. Participants reported that concerns regarding anonymity, questioning the severity of the incident, and an ingrained medical hierarchy prevented students reporting these incidents. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of GBD and SH from clinical teachers to medical students remains high, affecting female students more than male students. This study highlights key areas that must be improved to achieve a more equitable teaching experience in UK medical schools. Developing robust reporting and support systems is an important step in eradicating these behaviours.",2024,Apr,Med Teach,,,1-9,,10.1080/0142159X.2024.2331034,38564885,#21,Skan 2024,"",""
"A Study of Attitudes Toward Teacher-Student Sexual Misconduct Cases Based on Student Age, Student Gender, and Teacher Gender.",Wingrove T; Call AA; Clark H; Chenevert B; Pearce E,"Teacher-student sexual misconduct is a serious instance of child sexual abuse that impacts an estimated 10% of students. We tested whether two effects seen in research about these types of cases replicated across online American adult and undergraduate samples: (1) sympathy toward younger students who experience sexual abuse compared to older students and (2) leniency in cases of female teachers engaging with male students compared to other gender dyads. Participants (N = 525) reviewed a mock teacher-student sexual encounter and then answered questions about their views and case-related outcomes. Student age emerged as the most influential factor across all our variables of interest, where cases with younger students were viewed as more egregious than those involving older students. Incidents involving boys who experienced abuse were perceived as more ""normal"" than those involving girls. We found some support for the idea that there is leniency toward women teachers, but limited support for a female teacher-male student leniency effect. While these cases were viewed to be more normal and acceptable than other gender dyads, there were no effects on the other dependent variables. Sample type effects were also minimal, as our adult sample viewed the teachers involved to be more responsible and student complainants as more credible versus the undergraduate sample.",2024,Apr,J Child Sex Abus,33,3,398-414,,10.1080/10538712.2024.2369285,38910435,#22,Wingrove 2024,"",""
"Pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery residents' stress, career satisfaction, and gender-based discrimination/harassment.",Inglehart MR; Marti KC; LeBlanc MJ; Bak SY; Boynton J,"OBJECTIVES: Dental residents experience high stress in their demanding programs and gender-based harassment/discrimination can contribute to their stress. The objectives were to compare stress, satisfaction, experienced sexual harassment and observed discrimination of women in dental graduate programs with high, medium, and low percentages of women and to explore relationships between these constructs of interest. METHODS: Note that, 112 pediatric dentistry (PD), 44 prosthodontics, and 56 oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) residents responded to a survey. RESULTS: PD residents had the lowest personal life-related stress (4-point scale with 4 = very stressful: PD = 2.99/P = 3.67/OMS = 3.56; p < 0.001), faculty-related stress (2.68/3.66/3.03; p < 0.001), lack of confidence-related stress (2.79/3.31/2.96; p < 0.01) and academic stress (2.65/3.24/3.02; p < 0.001), while prosthodontics residents had the highest stress levels. The average frequency of experiencing sexual harassment was highest for OMS residents and lowest for PD residents (5-point scale with 1 = never: 1.15/2.62/2.74; p < 0.001). PD residents observed least and OMS residents most frequently that female residents were treated less positively by other residents because of their gender (1.59/2.57/3.00; p < 0.001). Prosthodontics residents had the lowest job satisfaction score (5-point scale with 1 = lowest satisfaction: 4.12/3.14/4.20; p < 0.001). The more frequently male and female residents experienced sexual harassment, the higher their personal life-related stress, faculty-related stress, lack of confidence-related stress, and academic stress, and the lower their career satisfaction, specialty content satisfaction, and stress-related satisfaction. Women's frequencies of observed gender-based discrimination were associated with higher stress and lower satisfaction, while men's frequencies of these observations were not associated with stress, but associated with increased satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Dental residents' stress, career satisfaction, experienced sexual harassment, and observed discrimination of women residents differ depending on the dental specialty program. Both male and female residents report more stress and less satisfaction the more they experience sexual harassment. The more women observe discrimination of women, the more stressed and the less satisfied they are. For men, the frequencies of these observations are not associated with stress, but positively associated with increased satisfaction.",2024,Apr,J Dent Educ,88 Suppl 1,,713-726,,10.1002/jdd.13554,38758043,#23,Inglehart 2024,"",""
Gender Differences in the Characterization of Child Sexual Abuse.,García-Montoliu C; Ballester-Arnal R; Nebot-Garcia JE; Ruiz-Palomino E,"Research on child sexual abuse (CSA) has increased in recent decades. However, the study of gender differences in this field is still scarce. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in the characterization of CSA between Spanish adult men and women. The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire was administered to 162 cisgender victims of CSA aged 18-63. Most of the abuses involved physical contact and were committed by a known person. Twenty percent of the victims indicated that they had developed a mental health problem that they believed was due to the CSA experience. Women suffered more CSA with physical contact and penetration, more types of abuse and more abuse by men, and were abused more frequently by a family member. Compared to women, men suffered more sexual abuse by women.

Gender Differences in Sexual Violence Perpetration Behaviors and Validity of Perpetration Reports: A Mixed-Method Study.,Jeffrey NK; Senn CY,"The current mixed-method study examined gender differences in sexual violence (SV) perpetration behaviors and the validity of perpetration reports made on the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration (SES-SFP). Fifty-four university students (31 women and 23 men) were asked to think out loud while privately completing an online version of the SES-SFP and to describe (typed response) behaviors that they reported having engaged in on the SES. Those who reported no such behavior were asked to describe any similar behaviors they may have engaged in. Integration of the quantitative responses on the SES and the qualitative descriptions of the events reported showed that men's SV perpetration was more frequent and severe than women's. The qualitative event descriptions further suggested that men's verbal coercion was often harsher in tone and that men more often than women used physical force (including in events only reported as verbal coercion on the SES). Unlike men, women often reported that their response to a refusal was not intended to pressure their partner or obtain the sexual activity. Two women also mistakenly reported experiences of their own victimization or compliance (giving in to unwanted sex) on SES perpetration items, which inflated women's SV perpetration rate. Findings suggest that quantitative measurement can miss important qualitative differences in women and men's behaviors and may underestimate men's and overestimate women's SV perpetration.

"3-month prevalence of unwanted sexual contact victimization in a national sample of college students: differences by race, gender identity, and sexual identity.",Fedina L; Bender AE; Royer M; Ashwell L; Tolman R; Herrenkohl TI,"IMPORTANCE: Most unwanted sexual contact victimization (USCV) research utilizes predominantly white, cisgender, heterosexual college student samples. Estimates of USCV prevalence and demographic variation can determine the need for dedicated funding and culturally relevant campus services for students in high-risk groups. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the national prevalence and demographic variation in self-reported USCV within the first three months of college. DESIGN: Data are from the Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergrads (SAPU) (2020-2021) dataset. SAPU is an online intervention program administered to students on more than 600 college campuses in the United States (N = 250,359). Group differences were assessed by race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual identity, and then stratified by gender to assess within-gender group differences. SETTING: The SAPU dataset includes public and private institutions and 2-year and 4-year colleges with varying sizes of enrollment. PARTICIPANTS: The sample is demographically diverse, and consists of newly matriculated U.S. college students, most of whom complete the SAPU program within the first three months of enrollment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure is self-reported USCV within the first three months of college enrollment, analyzed for subgroup differences. We hypothesized that USCV would be higher among students from racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual minority populations. RESULTS: Nearly 8% of transgender men reported USCV, followed by 7.4% of transgender women, 7.4% of genderqueer/gender non-conforming students, 4.5% of women, and 1.5% of men. Several subgroups reported exceedingly high rates of USCV, including Black students who identified as transgender women (35.7%) and American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students who identified as trans men (55.6%) or genderqueer/gender non-conforming (41.7%).

This study investigates sex differences in burden of interpersonal violence for adolescents and explores associations with gender inequality. METHOD: Using data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study, we report numbers, proportions, rates of interpersonal violence deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for all ages, and rate of change (from 1990 to 2019) in adolescents aged 10-24 years disaggregated by sex and geography. We explored associations with gender inequality using gender inequality index. RESULTS: One in four (24.8%) all-age interpersonal violence deaths are in adolescents. In 2019, the rate of deaths in adolescent males was almost six times higher than females (9.3 vs. 1.6 per 100,000); and since 1990, the rate of decline in DALYs for females was double than that for males (-28.9% vs. -12.7%). By contrast, the burden of sexual violence is disproportionately borne by adolescent females, with over double the rate than males (DALYs: 42.8 vs. 17.5 per 100,000). In countries with greater gender inequality, the male-to-female ratio (deaths and DALYs) was increased among older adolescents, pointing to benefits for males in more gender equal settings. DISCUSSION: Social identities, relationships, and attitudes to violence are established in adolescence, which is an inflection point marking the emergence of disproportionate burdens of interpersonal violence.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 518 respondents, with 420 responding to the Sexual Experience Questionnaire (SEQ). The survey measured harassment experiences and their impact on burnout, especially among female physicians. Correlations were analyzed to understand the association between these variables. RESULTS: Out of 1,375 invitees, we received 671 (48.8 %) responses. The study population was divided into two main groups: males (359) and females (312). The study identified a high prevalence of sexual harassment experiences among female physicians, with incidents occurring primarily during training. Moderate to large correlations were observed between SEQ subscales related to colleagues and patients and their families. While sexual harassment was not significantly related to burnout, this study suggests the need for interventions to create a safer medical workplace. Approximately 22 % of male participants (n = 359) reported career-related inappropriate sexual incidents, with 28 % of male physicians experiencing weekly burnout. Among female participants (n = 312), around 37 % reported inappropriate incidents, while 42 % of female physicians felt weekly burnout.

METHODS: A total of 2722 college students from 4 schools in Luzhou were recruited by multistage random sampling. Self-administered questionnaires were used to measure CSA experiences and premarital sex. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyse the relationship between CSA and premarital sex. RESULTS: The prevalence of CSA was 9.39%, and that of mild, moderate and severe CSA was 4.04%, 2.90% and 2.46%, respectively. The premarital sex reporting rate was 22.42%. After adjusting for confounding variables, CSA was positively associated with premarital sex. Notably, a cumulative effect of CSA on premarital sex was observed among students. Further stratification analyses showed that males who experienced CSA had a higher premarital sex rate than females, and this sex difference was also observed among students with different CSA severities. CONCLUSION: CSA and its severity were associated with premarital sex among college students. Furthermore, this association was stronger for males than females. Therefore, it is important to emphasize CSA prevention, especially for boys.

"Association Between Sexual Harassment Intervention Strategies and the Sexual Harassment Perception and Attitude of University Students in Beijing, China.",He H; Wang X; Wang P; Liu S,"Sexual harassment in universities harms the physical and psychological health and development of students. Although Chinese universities are required to implement sexual harassment interventions, few studies have estimated how well interventions are perceived by students and the association with their perceptions and attitudes toward sexual harassment. This study aims to examine the perceptions and attitudes toward sexual harassment and perceived sexual harassment interventions among university students. Further, it evaluated the association between sexual harassment interventions and sexual harassment perceptions and attitudes among university students and explored potential gender differences in the observed associations. We categorized sexual harassment interventions into three types of strategies (informal education activities, prevention mechanisms, and multiformat publicity) and designed an 8-item scale for sexual harassment perception and a 10-item scale for sexual harassment attitude. A total of 872 students were recruited from six universities in Beijing, China. Association between intervention strategies and sexual harassment perceptions and attitudes was analyzed using multiple linear regression. The results showed that 78.56% of the university students recognized all sexual harassment behaviors, and 11.58% felt angry about all sexual harassment behaviors.

Twenty-eight (76%) supported the #MeToo movement, four (11%) had negative opinions, and five (13.5%) were ambivalent or unwilling to comment. Seventeen (46%) were concerned that #MeToo damaged working relationships, twelve (32%) were concerned about overreach, and eight (22%) about false accusations. CONCLUSIONS: This group of older female physicians reported extensive experience of gender-based mistreatment and strong support of #MeToo. Nevertheless, about one quarter of the group did not support the #MeToo movement and even supporters expressed high rates of concern about the movement going too far, falsely accusing men of inappropriate behavior, and damaging working relationships.

Direct and indirect effects of workplace sexual harassment on the productivity of victims and witnesses: The preventive role of equitable management.,Vara-Horna AA; Díaz-Rosillo A; Asencios-Gonzalez Z; Quipuzco-Chicata L,"This research demonstrates the impact of equitable management as a protective factor against workplace sexual harassment (WSH) and its consequences on labor productivity. It also shows that there are invisible costs for colleagues who witness WSH, through counterproductive behaviors, such as sabotage or production deviance, with an indirect decrease in labor productivity. We used a structured questionnaire that was answered by 827 women from 37 small, medium, and large private companies in the Lima Metropolitan Area, Peru. We designed a conceptual model and tested it using structural covariance equations. The results indicate that 33.5 % of women have been sexually harassed over the last 12 months, an average of 6.6 times, while 18.9 % of women have supported co-workers who were victims of WSH. Being sexually harassed at work decreases labor productivity by 43.1 % and increases the intention to desert the company by 15.2 %. Witnessing WSH increases the intention to drop out by 11.3 % and increases counterproductive behaviors by 39.6 %. We found that equitable management is a preventative factor for WSH. Equitable management not only decreases the probability of the occurrence of WSH by 2.2 times but also-if it exists-reduces its pernicious impact on productivity through various indirect effects. Equitable management can reduce the labor productivity costs caused by WSH by 4.6 times.",2023,Nov,Heliyon,9,11,e21096,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e21096,37920480,#38,Vara-Horna 2023,"",""
The role of gender as a barrier to the professional development of psychiatrists.,Kilic O; Riecher-Rössler A; Galderisi S; Gorwood P; Frangou S; Pinto da Costa M,"BACKGROUND: Despite efforts toward greater gender equality in clinical and academic psychiatry in recent years, more information is needed about the challenges in professional development within psychiatry, and how these may vary with gender. METHODS: A cross-sectional 27-item online survey was conducted with psychiatrists and psychiatric trainee members of the European Psychiatric Association. RESULTS: A total of 561 psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees from 35 European countries participated representing a response rate of 52.8% for women and 17.7% for men from a total sample of 1,580. The specific challenges that women face in their professional development fall into two categories. One comprised women's negative attitudes concerning their abilities in self-promotion and networking. The other identified environmental barriers related to lack of opportunity and support and gender discrimination. Compared to men, women reported higher rates of gender discrimination in terms of professional advancement. Women were less likely to agree that their institutions had regular activities promoting inclusion, diversity, and training to address implicit gender bias. Working in high-income countries compared to middle-income countries relates to reporting institutional support for career progression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are an open call to hospital leaders, deans of medical schools, and department chairs to increase efforts to eradicate bias against women and create safer, inclusive, and respectful environments for all psychiatrists, a special call to women psychiatrists to be aware of inner tendencies to avoid self-promotion and networking and to think positively and confidently about themselves and their abilities.",2023,Oct,Eur Psychiatry,66,1,e89,,10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.2462,37848403,#39,Kilic 2023,"",""
Gender and coping with HIV: a qualitative study of older childhood sexual abuse survivors living with HIV.,Nkwonta CA; Brown MJ; James T; Kaur A; Hart MJ,"People living with HIV often have complex identities and histories. Understanding how these experiences influence adherence to treatment and quality of life are critical to the HIV care. The experiences of older adults living with HIV are uniquely embedded within biology and aging as well as gender. This study described the gendered strategies for coping with HIV among older adults who are childhood sexual abuse survivors. Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were performed with 24 adults who are 50 years and older from a clinic in South Carolina. Thematic analysis approach was used to discuss key concepts, reconcile codes, and name emergent themes. Overall, the participants used a spectrum of coping strategies including spirituality, seclusion, social support, substance use, engagement in HIV care, information acquisition and sharing, and cognitive reframing. Our findings suggest the potential for growth and recovery is heightened if the interplay of HIV diagnosis, aging, coping, and mental health is considered.

Comparing female- to male-perpetrated child sexual abuse as presumed by survivors - A qualitative content analysis.,Schröder J; Briken P; Tozdan S,"BACKGROUND: Female-perpetrated child sexual abuse (CSA) is taboo topic in society and an under-recognized issue in research and mental health care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine perspectives of individuals surviving female-perpetrated CSA (in parts in addition with male-perpetrated CSA) on the question whether female-perpetrated CSA and its sequelae were considered different compared to male-perpetrated CSA. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The perspectives of 212 survivors of female-perpetrated CSA were captured in a cross-sectional online study. METHODS: Answers to the questions ""How does female-perpetrated CSA differ from male-perpetrated CSA?"" and ""How do consequences of female-perpetrated CSA differ from those of male-perpetrated CSA?"" were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analyses reveal ten categories of differences, such as a more subtle approach, different levels of violence, and more psychological manipulation. Further, the analyses suggest ten categories of different personal consequences, such as less belief and support, more psychological sequelae, and disturbed relationships with women.

Gender Differences in Behavioral Problems in Child Victims of Sexual Abuse: Contribution of Self-Blame of the Parent and Child.,De Champlain A; Tremblay-Perreault A; Hébert M,"The consequences associated with child sexual abuse are well known. However, factors exacerbating child behavior problems following sexual abuse (SA) deserve further attention. Self-blame following the abuse has been identified as a predictor of negative outcomes in adult survivors, however there is limited evidence regarding the impact of self-blame on consequences in child victims of sexual abuse. This study assessed behavioral problems in a sample of sexually abused children and tested the mediating role of children's internal blame attributions in the association between the parent's self-blame and the internalizing and externalizing difficulties of the child. A sample of 1066 sexually abused children between 6 and 12 years of age and their non-offending caregiver completed self-report questionnaires. Parents completed questionnaires related to the child's behavior following the SA and their own feelings of self-blame regarding the SA. Children completed a questionnaire assessing their level of self-blame. Results showed that parents' self-blame was associated with a higher level of self-blame in the child which, in turn, was linked to more child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. In addition, parents' self-blame was directly associated with a higher level of internalizing difficulties in children.

In this study, researchers describe the most common types of behaviors that occurred, characteristics of alleged perpetrators, and times and places in which the experiences occurred. They also explore differences by gender, sexual orientation, and installation risk level. Nearly 90 percent of victims believed that the assault was committed for a sexual reason, and more than half indicated that the assault was meant to be abusive or humiliating. The typical perpetrator of victims' most serious sexual assault experiences was a male enlisted member of the military acting alone. Perpetrators were most often a military peer of the victim; perpetrators who were strangers to the victim were uncommon; and assaults by spouses, significant others, or family members were comparatively rare. Approximately two-thirds of victims' most serious experience of sexual assault occurred at a military installation. The authors found substantial differences by gender, especially in terms of the types of sexual assault behaviors victims experienced and in terms of the setting in which victims were sexually assaulted. The authors also found some evidence suggesting that sexual minorities-that is, individuals who identify with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual-may experience more-violent sexual assaults and more assaults that are meant to abuse, humiliate, haze, or bully, especially among men.",2023,Jun,Rand Health Q,10,3,10,,,37333672,#46,Calkins 2023,"",""
The stronger and the weaker sex - gender differences in the perception of individuals who experienced physical and sexual violence in childhood. A scoping review.,Rechenberg T; Schomerus G,"BACKGROUND: Violence against children is an issue of serious concern. Stigma impacts coping with childhood trauma. A central aspect regarding disclosing trauma and seeking help is the social perception of the victim and survivor's gender. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to synthesize qualitative and quantitative research about the impact of the victim and survivor gender on the societal perceptions of individuals who have experienced sexual and/or physical violence in childhood. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This review considered both society's and victims and survivors' perspectives on gender-linked perceptions concerning individuals with childhood trauma. METHODS: The initial search was conducted in November 2021 and involved the databases Web of Science, PubMed, and PsychInfo. All studies, published in English or German, that reported study design, sample characteristics, and gender-linked perceptions of individuals with a history of sexual and/or physical violence in childhood were included. RESULTS: A total of 10,373 studies were identified, of which 20 studies were eligible for review. Six studies reported no significant victim gender effect. However, when significant victim gender effects were present, males were characterized with considerably more stigmatizing attributes regarding the blame category while females were exposed to considerably more stigmatizing attributes regarding the harm category. CONCLUSIONS: Females and males experience stigmatization reflecting typical stereotypes of femininity and masculinity. Thus, females are perceived as more vulnerable, more burdened, and with a higher need for security than males. Males are seen as more blameworthy and less trustworthy than females due to their presumed capability to physically resist or escape abuse.",2023,Jun,Child Abuse Negl,140,,106131,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106131,36934639,#47,Rechenberg 2023,"",""

Experiences of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use drugs in a Canadian setting: a gender-based cross-sectional study.,Swaich A; Richardson L; Cui Z; DeBeck K; Milloy MJ; Kerr T; Hayashi K,"OBJECTIVES: People who use drugs (PWUD) experience disproportionately high rates of violent victimization. Emerging research has demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated violence against some priority populations (e.g., women), however there is limited research examining the impact of the pandemic on the experiences of violence of PWUD. METHODS: Using data collected between July and November 2020 from three prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada, we employed multivariable logistic regression stratified by gender to identify factors associated with recent experiences of violence, including the receipt of COVID-19 emergency income support. RESULTS: In total, 77 (17.3%) of 446 men, and 54 (18.8%) of 288 women experienced violence in the previous six months.

Impact of gender in congenital heart surgery: Results from a national survey.,Sinha R; Brimacombe M; Romano JC,"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data regarding the impact of gender within congenital heart surgery. Our aim was to assess gender-related experiences by surgeons in this field. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was emailed to practicing congenital heart surgeons to ascertain the perception of gender in 5 domains: training, professional career, clinical practice, personal life, and career outlook. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 94% (17/18) for women and 44% (112/257) for men. More than half of women (53%) were discouraged from pursuing congenital heart surgery (P < .001) and reported a negative impact of gender in attaining their first congenital heart surgery job (P < .001) compared with men. Despite similar demographics, women reported lower starting annual salaries ($150K-$250K vs $250K-$400K), lower current annual salaries ($500K-$750K vs $750K-$1M), lower academic ranks (clinical instructor 6% vs 4% [P = .045], assistant professor 35% vs 19% [P = .19], associate professor 41% vs 25% [P = .24], and professor 6% vs 41% [P = .005]) along with lower annual salaries at the associate professor ($500K-$750K vs $1M-$1.25M) and professor levels ($1M-$1.25M vs >$1.5M) compared with men.

Gender Wage Gap and Male Perpetrated Child Sexual Abuse.,Hans Z; Belzer M,"Given the fact that child abuse and intimate partner violence often co-occur, intra-household bargaining models provide a useful framework to investigate the relationship between macro-economic factors and child sexual abuse (CSA). Non-cooperative bargaining models predict that labor market opportunities that benefit women improve their bargaining power and lead to lower levels of intimate partner violence against them. We posit that this protective effect extends to children as well, and exploit exogenous variation in macro-economic factors to examine the impact of gender specific wages and employment on police reported CSA in South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia from 2006 to 2019. The empirical analysis provides evidence that narrowing the gender wage gap leads to a decline in police reported CSA incidents perpetrated by mothers' intimate partners, whereas improvements in relative employment opportunities do not yield any such effects. Consistent with previous literature, our results show that wages, not employment, determine bargaining power.

Addressing Sexual Harassment and Gender Bias: Mandatory Modules Are Not Enough.,Russell HA; Sanders M; Nofziger A; Fogarty CT; McDaniel SH; Rosenberg T; Fiscella K; Naumburg E,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite decades of new policy guidelines and mandatory training modules, sexual harassment (SH) and gender bias (GB) continue in academic medicine. The hierarchical structure of medical training makes it challenging to act when one experiences or witnesses SH or GB. Most trainings designed to address SH and GB are driven by external mandates and do not utilize current educational techniques. Our goal was to design training that is in-person, active, and directed toward skills development. METHODS: Our academic family medicine (FM) department began by surveying our faculty and residents about their lived experiences of SH and GB. We used these data, incorporating principles of adult learning, to deliver voluntary, experiential, interactive workshops throughout 2019. The workshops took place during faculty development meetings and an annual retreat. We used interactive techniques that included case-based and Theater of the Oppressed formats. OUTCOMES: Eighty percent of faculty and residents participated in at least one of our voluntary training sessions. In April of 2020, we administered a retrospective, pre/postsurvey on confidence in recognizing, responding to, and reporting SH and GB. We found significant improvements in all domains surveyed; many participants reported using the skills in the 6 months prior to completing the surveys. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that voluntary, interactive training sessions using the recommendations of the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine Report on the Sexual Harassment of Women improve participants' reported confidence in recognizing, responding to, and reporting SH and GB in one academic FM department.

We tested a multigroup parallel process latent growth curve model (recent depression symptoms; past-year BD) with time-varying covariates (past-year sexual harassment; sexual assault) to determine associations of sexual violence with BD and depression outcomes over time, and whether growth curves and associations differed by SGM status. For both SGM and non-SGM emerging adults, past-year sexual harassment was associated with depressive symptoms at each time point, but harassment was not associated with BD. For both groups, sexual assault was associated with both depressive symptoms and BD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine longitudinal, contemporaneous associations of sexual violence (including both harassment and assault as distinct constructs), with BD and depressive symptoms among racially and ethnically diverse emerging adults, comparing SGM and non-SGM groups.

Female Medical Students' Experiences of Sexism during Clinical Placements: A Qualitative Study.,Ibrahim D; Riley R,"In the UK, more women are studying medicine than men, most of whom have experienced sexism, yet these experiences are under-researched. This qualitative study explores female medical students' experiences of sexism on placement, impacts sustained, barriers and facilitators encountered upon reporting. A total of 17 semi-structured interviews were conducted, employing purposive sampling, snowball sampling and an inductive thematic analysis. A qualitative methodology was underpinned by the feminist social constructionist theory. Four themes were identified: 1-experiences of sexism, comprising physical and verbal harassment and microaggressions; 2-negative impacts of sexist encounters ranged from psychosocial to repercussions on learning and development; 3-systemic and attitudinal barriers to reporting; 4-recommendations to tackle sexism shaped by the views and experiences of female medical student participants. Female medical students experienced wide-ranging sexism which negatively impacted their wellbeing with negative repercussions for their training and development. The barriers to reporting need to be urgently addressed, and systems, policies and processes need to be over-hauled to sensitively, effectively and equitably manage and provide justice to students who experience and report sexism. Students need to be empowered to respond, report and be offered psychological safety in doing so. Attitudes and practices which are complicit in sustaining sexism need to be challenged and changed.",2023,Mar,Healthcare (Basel),11,7,,,10.3390/healthcare11071002,37046928,#58,Ibrahim 2023,"",""
Can Prior Sexual Abuse Explain Global Differences in Measured Self-Esteem in Male and Female Adolescents?,Sawyerr A; Adam-Bagley C,"World research has shown that adolescent and young adult women and girls have significantly ""poorer"" self-esteem than men and boys, on a variety of previously validated self-esteem measures. There is no consensus on reasons for this, and a variety of factors have been proposed: some adolescent girls have a preoccupation with facial and body features, and this leads to a global negative evaluation of self-characteristics; the measures themselves are biased towards describing self-characteristics on which men and boys are likely to evaluate themselves more favourably; and in an often-sexist world, women and girls experience (or anticipate) many structural disadvantages, in education, career and promotion, which lead girls to ""internalise"" an image of themselves as less able or worthy than men and boys. A separate literature on the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents has found that (a) sexual exploitation and maltreatment often has a sequel in impaired self-concept and self-esteem and (b) sexual maltreatment is twice as likely to occur in women and girls. It is puzzling that differential levels of child sexual abuse have not been advanced in many studies as an explanation of gender differences in self-esteem in the large-scale studies we review, although this effect is confirmed by clinical and social work literature.",2023,Jan,Children (Basel),10,2,,,10.3390/children10020276,36832404,#59,Sawyerr 2023,"",""

Social support may buffer that relationship. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from a retrospective cohort study were analyzed to examine if discrimination and sexual victimization overlap to exacerbate symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to determine the extent to which social support moderated that association among Black women living in Baltimore, Maryland [138 non-abused (no physical/sexual victimization) and 98 abused (sexually victimized) since age 18]. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression and PTSD were independently associated with discrimination. Multilinear regression showed social support from friends moderated the association between discrimination and depressive symptoms among sexually abused participants only.

Association between the experience of sexual violence and insomnia in a national sample of French adults.,Reynaud E; Vuillermoz C; Léon C; Roland N; El Khoury F,"PURPOSEL: The experience of sexual violence has been associated with sleeping disorders; however, few studies have examined this association using a large sample of the general population. This study investigates whether lifetime experience of sexual violence and childhood experience of sexual violence are associated with insomnia. METHODS: Our study is based on data from the 2017 French Health Barometer, a general population phone cross-sectional survey, which included 25 319 adults aged 18-75 years in 2017. Questions regarding sleep quality were asked to 12 560 participants, and insomnia was defined according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). We conducted adjusted Log-binomial regressions to examine the association between the experience of sexual violence and insomnia by calculating adjusted Prevalence Ratios (PRa; 95% CI). RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of insomnia was 13.5%, with women more affected than men (17.9% vs 9.6%). The prevalence of lifetime experience of sexual violence was around 3 times higher among those who suffer from insomnia (12.3%) compared to those who do not (4.5%).

The Dandarah App: An mHealth Platform to Tackle Violence and Discrimination of Sexual and Gender Minority Persons Living in Brazil.,Baptista Silva A; Malta M; da Silva CMFP; Kalume CC; Filha IGA; LeGrand S; Whetten K,"Discrimination and violence are widely experienced by sexual and gender minority (SGM) persons worldwide. More than one SGM person is murdered every day in Brazil because of their sexuality or gender identity, which is the highest reported homicide rate in the world. Alt-hough discrimination and violence against SGM persons in Brazil are considered to be hate crimes, reporting is still suboptimal due to fear of police SGM phobia and victim blaming. Accessible and easily disseminated interventions are urgently needed. Herein, we describe the develop-ment of an mHealth solution to help address violence against SGM persons, namely the Rainbow Resistance: Dandarah App, with a synthesis of key results and feedback from the SGM community after 24 months of using the app. Twenty-two focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with SGM persons living in six Brazilian states: Bahia, Federal District, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Sergipe, and Pará. A total of 300 SGM persons participated in the FGDs. A thematic analysis was performed to interpret the qualitative data. Content themes related to aesthetics, us-ability, barriers to resources, and likes/dislikes about the intervention arose from the FGDs. Participants found the intervention to be user-friendly, endorsed more likes than dislikes, and suggested a few changes to the app. The findings suggest that the intervention is usable and fit for future ef-fectiveness testing, and that it could fill an important gap in the well-being of SGM persons living in a country with high levels of discrimination and violence towards this community, i.e., Brazil.",2022,Dec,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,1,,,10.3390/ijerph20010280,36612598,#62,BaptistaSilva 2022,"",""

It is unclear whether the field has made progress toward its goal of equity. We aimed to describe: (1) the recent gender-equity climate according to women and men faculty in the department of pediatrics at a single, large academic center, and (2) institutional efforts to address persistent gender discrimination and harassment. In late 2020, we distributed an anonymous survey to all department faculty that included demographic data, a modified version of the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work Scale, questions about experiences/witnessed discriminatory treatment and sexual harassment, and if those experiences negatively affected career advancement. Of 524 pediatrics faculty, 290 (55%) responded. Compared with men, women more commonly reported gender discrimination (50% vs. 4%, P < .01) and that their gender negatively affected their career advancement (50% vs 9%, P < .01). More than 50% of women reported discriminatory treatment at least annually and 38% recognized specific sexist statements; only 4% and 17% of men reported the same (P < .01 for both). We concluded that a disproportionately low number of male faculty recognized the harassment female faculty experienced. In the 18 months since, our department and university have made efforts to improve salary equity and parity in leadership representation, created an anonymous bias-reporting portal, mandated bias training, and implemented new benchmarks of ""professionalism"" that focus on diversity.

This study investigates (1) the prevalence of food, healthcare, and housing insecurity across gender and racial groups exposed to IPV and SV and (2) associations between exposure to past-year IPV and SV and past-year food, healthcare, and housing insecurity controlling for confounding factors. A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. Data from 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) were analyzed in a nationally representative sample of men (N = 8079) and women (N = 9970). Logistic regressions were used to model associations between past-year intimate partner and sexual violence and dependent variables of food, healthcare, and housing insecurity. Analyses were stratified by gender and included control variables of age, income, education, and race/ethnicity. Higher rates of food, housing, and healthcare insecurity were found among men and women of color exposed to violence, particularly among respondents who identified as Black/African American, Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, and other racial/ethnic minority groups. For men, IPV and SV was associated with higher odds for experiencing food (AOR = 2.40, p <.001), housing (AOR = 2.06, p <.001), and healthcare insecurity (AOR = 2.39, p <.001).

We used an experimental design to investigate how salient norms associated with the social identity of 'women' affect coping with sexual harassment. Participants who identified as women (N = 291) were randomly assigned to either a feminist, traditional feminine, or control norm condition, in which the salience of particular norms associated with womanhood was manipulated. Participants completed measures of personal growth (as a proxy for post-traumatic growth), and help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical sexual harassment scenario. Participants in the feminist condition reported significantly greater personal growth relative to those in the traditional feminine and control conditions. Participants in both the feminist and traditional feminine conditions reported significantly greater intentions to seek help from formal supports (e.g. primary care doctor), relative to those in the control condition.

Status of women in congenital heart surgery: Results from a national survey.,Sinha R; Herbst K; Romano JC,"OBJECTIVE: Gender disparity in cardiothoracic surgery, but not specifically in congenital heart surgery, has been a growing focus. The aim of this study was to describe the experiences related to gender for women in this field. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was designed to assess gender perception in 5 domains: training, professional career, clinical practice, personal life, and career outlook. Inclusion criteria were women who trained and are practicing congenital heart surgery in the United States. RESULTS: Eighteen women were identified with a survey response rate of 94% (17/18). The majority of respondents were aged more than 40 years (94%) and White (69%), chose their career in congenital heart surgery during residency (77%), and completed more than 10 years of postgraduate education (56%). More than half were discouraged from congenital heart surgery because of their gender and reported its negative impact on their ability to obtain their first job. The need to ""outperform"" their male colleagues was nearly universal (94%), and gender pay disparity was reported by 81%. The majority (65%) reported sexual harassment both during surgical training and as staff surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights many areas (discouragement due to gender, sexual harassment, and gender disparities in pay and leadership opportunities) that women may perceive as barriers to a successful career in congenital heart surgery.

This study provides information about the attitudes and perceptions of Spanish youths towards sexual violence within that setting. The participants were recruited by a snowball sampling scheme. A bivariate analysis was performed to identify possible sociodemographic and nightlife recreational habit factors related to gender. The statistical significance of the differences between the studied variables was assessed using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Women perceived a low level of personal security, as well as the existence of social perceptions penalizing female more than male drug use, and blaming women for the sexual violence they suffer. Women also recognised less explicit violent behaviours as violence significantly more than men did. Men were more willing to have sexual intercourse with someone unable to express consent because of drugs. In addition, they believed more strongly that sexual assaults take place because of the victim's use of alcohol or other drugs. In a leisure nightlife context, women are prone to perceive a lack of social support for themselves and the feeling of impunity for the perpetrators. Furthermore, numerous misconceptions surround drug-facilitated sexual assaults, with the majority of respondents believing that assaults happen after the surreptitious administration of substances to the victim by an unknown assailant. Moreover, the involvement of alcohol was underestimated.

Legislative and judicial responses to workplace sexual harassment in mainland China: Progress and drawbacks.,Wang H,"BACKGROUND: China has recently upgraded its anti-sexual harassment laws and regulations. The first-ever Chinese Civil Code, which took effect in 2021, has explicitly defined sexual harassment and imposed affirmative duties on employers to prevent and correct work-related sexual harassment. This study aims to map the status quo of China's anti-sexual harassment legal system and explore its progress and limits in dealing with workplace sexual harassment. METHODS: We reviewed China's anti-sexual harassment laws at the national, provincial, and municipal levels and observed how they were enforced in courts. All judicial cases of workplace sexual harassment published by Chinese courts between January 2021 and June 2022 were examined. From a comparative law perspective, we then identified the progress and drawbacks of China's legislative and judicial responses to workplace sexual harassment. RESULTS: China's current anti-sexual harassment legal system, while have made commendable progress, has its drawbacks: the definition of sexual harassment remains to be clarified and expanded to make it clear that sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination and can include hostile environment harassment that is not directed against a specific person; the employer's obligations to prevent and correct sexual harassment need further delineation; employers lack guidelines for establishing a fair and effective grievance procedure; the difficulty of proving sexual harassment in litigation remains unsolved; the employer liability doctrine for sexual harassment lacks clarity; workers not in a traditional employment relationship receive inadequate legal protection from work-related sexual harassment.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: anonymous survey was distributed to sports medicine physicians practicing in 51 countries. χ(2) analysis was used to detect differences between female and male sports medicine physicians and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent variables that affect disrespectful attitudes and sexual harassment from sports participants. RESULTS: 1193 sports medicine physicians (31.9% female) participated from 51 countries. The survey revealed that female physicians, compared with male physicians, perceive significantly more disrespect or have their judgement questioned more by the following categories: male and female athletes, male and female coaches, female physicians with more years of experience, male physicians (regardless of years of experience), male and female ATs and organisation/administrations (all p<0.05). The only category where the frequency of disrespect was perceived equally by male and female physicians was during their interactions with female physicians who have the same or lesser years of experience. Female sports medicine physicians noted more sexual harassment than male physicians during interactions with male athletes, coaches, ATs and physicians (all p<0.001). In the logistic regression, gender was a related factor for perceiving disrespect, especially from male coaches (OR=2.01) and physicians with more years of experience (OR=2.18).

Comparing Factors Shaping Sexual Violence Perpetration for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth and Cisgender Heterosexual Youth.,Nath R; Ybarra M; MacAulay M; Oppenheim K; Jackson L; Strøm IF; Sullivan R; Millar S; Saewyc E,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience higher rates of sexual violence victimization than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts. Very little is known about how the minority status of SGM youth contextualizes their victimization and perpetration experiences. In one-on-one interviews with 39 SGM youth and 11 cisgender heterosexuals (non-SGM) youth, we compared the contextual factors shaping sexual violence victimization and perpetration between the two groups using a qualitative descriptive approach. Interviews highlighted how SGM youth continue to experience extensive discrimination that negatively impacts all aspects of their lives, while non-SGM youth do not discuss having to navigate stigma and discrimination in their lives. SGM youth pointed to a lack of understanding of sexual violence within the SGM community. Both groups believed that SGM perpetration was unlikely: while most SGM and non-SGM youth agreed that sexual violence between youth was a problem, same-gender perpetration was seldom discussed. Unlike their non-SGM counterparts, SGM youth felt that they were targeted because of their sexual and gender identity. SGM youth also felt that they were more vulnerable to sexual violence because of how they physically looked, particularly if their gender expression did not match cis-normative expectations. SGM youth reported facing unique pressures when seeking support as a victim, particularly a fear of being outed or stigmatized as part of the process. They also conveyed that SGM people worried about being treated unfairly if they reported sexual violence to authorities. Findings suggest that stigma and concerns of discrimination are unique aspects of sexual violence for SGM compared to non-SGM youth. All youth need to have access to sexual violence prevention education that includes SGM and non-SGM youth as both victims and perpetrators to begin addressing these noted disparities in experiences.",2022,Sep,J Interpers Violence,37,17-18,NP15826-NP15850,,10.1177/08862605211021998,34841958,#79,Nath 2022,"",""

The sample included women who identified as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, and asexual or questioning. The mean age was 19.1 years and 71.4% were White. Rates of victimization involving sexual harassment and sexual acts without consent were higher among sexual minority women relative to heterosexual women, with bisexual women being most likely to report these outcomes. Compared to heterosexual women, sexual minority women reported more frequent cigarette smoking, marijuana use and intoxication, use of club drugs, and overall illicit drug use. Across sexual violence and substance use outcomes, bisexual women reported the highest rates. Sexual minority women reported more accurate beliefs about sexual violence and consent relative to heterosexual women.

Aspects of Gender and Sexuality in Relation to Experiences of Subjection to Sexual Harassment among Adolescents in General Population.,Kaltiala R,"Subjection to sexual harassment (SH) has been reported more commonly by girls than by boys, by sexual and gender minority youth more than by mainstream youth, and by sexually active youth more than by those not yet experienced in romantic and erotic encounters. However, the research so far has not addressed these correlates simultaneously. This study aimed to explore independent associations between experiencing SH and these aspects of sex, gender and sexuality-considering all of them concurrently. A cross sectional survey with data from Finland was used, with an analyzable sample of 71,964 adolescents aged 14 to 16-years- of age, collected in 2017. The data were analysed using cross-tabulations with chi-square statistics and logistic regression analyses. The types of SH studied were gender harassment, unwelcome sexual attention, and sexual coercion. Girls, sexual and gender minority youth, and youth engaging in romantic and erotic encounters had experienced all three types of SH more commonly than boys, mainstream youth and those not sexually active. Associations between minority status and experiences of sexual harassment were stronger among boys, and being sexually active had stronger associations with subjection to sexual harassment in girls.

Retrospective Perceptions of Grooming in Same-Sex versus Opposite-Sex Child Sexual Abuse.,Spenard KD; Cash DK,"Research on child sexual abuse (CSA) has predominantly focused on opposite-sex (e.g., male adult-female child) adult-child pairs, neglecting same-sex (e.g., male adult-male child) adult-child pairs. Grooming behaviors are an early indicator of CSA and while it is important to recognize grooming to prevent abuse, research has shown that detecting these behaviors is a difficult task. Despite this difficulty, people retrospectively overestimate their ability to recognize abuse once it is clear that abuse has occurred. The current study investigated how outcome information (abuse did or did not occur) and the sex of the adult-child pair influenced perceptions of adult-child interactions. Participants evaluated vignettes depicting grooming and non-grooming behaviors in same-sex and opposite-sex adult-child conditions.

#Metoo or #Hertoo? A Moderated Mediation Model of Gender Differences in Perceptions of Sexual Harassment.,Clarke HM,"Sexual harassment continues to pervade workplaces due, at least in part, to gender differences in the perception of sociosexual behaviors. Some scholars have argued that such differences are minimal and inconsistent. This study examined and demonstrated several reasons why this conclusion is fallacious. Approximately equal numbers of gay men (n = 191), heterosexual men (n = 193), lesbians (n = 190), and heterosexual women (n = 196) reported their perceptions of scenarios describing an interaction between a target and their manager. The target was either a fictional female, a fictional male, or the participant. As predicted, only heterosexual men's perceptions of sociosexual behaviors varied by the target of the behaviors. Heterosexual men viewed the behaviors as harassment only when the target was female. Further, women and gay men, but not heterosexual men, viewed the sociosexual behaviors as discrimination. The results also supported a moderated mediation model where, following exposure to sociosexual behaviors, the effect of participant group on perceived sexual harassment was mediated by fear and perceived discrimination and moderated by target.

Disparities by Gender and Race/Ethnicity in Child Maltreatment and Memory Performance.,Brown MJ; Jiang Y; Hung P; Haider MR; Crouch E,"Adverse childhood experiences, which include child maltreatment, are a major public health issue nationally. Child maltreatment has been linked to poorer cognitive functioning, which can start in childhood and persist into adulthood. However, studies examining the potential disparities by gender and race/ethnicity are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the gender and racial/ethnic disparities in the association between child maltreatment and memory performance. Data were obtained from Waves III and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11,624). Weighted multiple linear regression models were used to assess the associations between sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, and child maltreatment score and memory. Models were stratified by gender, race, and ethnicity.

Gender Differences in Sexual Coercion Perpetration: Investigating the Role of Alcohol-use and Cognitive Risk Factors.,Bonneville V; Trottier D,"Studies have shown that alcohol is involved in 50 to 75% of all sexual coercion situations. Significant associations have been established between alcohol-use and sexual coercion perpetration and cognitive factors have been proposed to play an important role in this association. However, the current knowledge on the relationship between alcohol-use, cognitive factors, and sexual coercion perpetration is mostly based on male samples. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate gender differences associated with the role of alcohol-use and cognitive factors in sexual coercion perpetration. To do so, 742 participants (562 women, 180 men) completed an online questionnaire assessing (1) alcohol-use, (2) perpetration of sexual coercion, and (3) cognitions related to sexuality or alcohol (misperception of sexual intent, alcohol-related expectancies, alcohol-related rape myth acceptance [RMA]). Results revealed that (1) for both men and women, alcohol-use as well as cognitive variables allowed to discriminate perpetrators from non-perpetrators, (2) perpetrators, whether male or female, did not differ significantly on any of the risk factors, except for alcohol-related RMA, (3) a prediction model that considered cognitive variables, as well as alcohol-use significantly contributed to the explanation of both male and female sexual coercion, and (4) the prediction model explained three times the amount of variance in sexual coercion perpetrated by men compared to women. On the one hand, these results highlight similarities in risk factors towards sexual coercion perpetration for both men and women. Perpetrators, regardless of their gender, seem to exhibit similar alcohol-use, alcohol-related expectancies, and tendencies to misinterpret sexual intent, making these risk factors potential prevention and intervention targets for both genders.

Perception of Gender Equality Matters: Targets' Responses to Workplace Sexual Harassment in Chinese Metropolises.,Wang X; Chui WH; Wang Y,"Workplace sexual harassment (WSH) has been recognized in the literature as a serious problem for the past 40 years. Since 2017, the global #MeToo movement has fostered local awareness of WSH and inspired researchers in China to pay increasing attention. Guided by the gender empowerment theory, this study investigated the relationships between women's responses as targets of WSH (e.g., choosing avoidance or confrontation) and both their perceptions of gender equality and their knowledge of the relevant national laws. We used data from a recent large-scale online survey conducted on the topic of sexual harassment among Chinese women in four metropolitan cities in 2018 and selected 862 women who had experienced WSH during the previous 12 months as the study sample. The results revealed that 545 of the respondents chose to show resistance when faced with WSH, while 287 identified their boss as their harasser. In addition, respondents' perceptions of gender equality and their knowledge of national laws on anti-domestic violence were shown to have positive effects on their responses as targets of WSH. Moreover, monthly income, household registration, and type of WSH were found to be associated with targets' responses in a statistically significant way, whereas their marital status, educational background, and age were not. Furthermore, the study found that the boss as harasser weakened the relationship between women's perception of gender equality and their active response to WSH incidents. With this study, we advance our understanding of the important role that perceptions of gender equality play in women's responses as targets of WSH, and we discuss implications for prevention and intervention efforts that encourage targets to actively respond.

However, knowledge on the context of victimization in depressed patients is lacking, and research identifying targets for prevention is urgently needed. METHODS: This cross-sectional study explored context characteristics, disclosure rates and gender differences regarding violent victimization in 153 recently victimized depressed patients. Additionally, 12-month prevalence rates of repeat threat, physical assault, and sexual assault were examined, and gender differences were investigated using t-tests, Chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with repeat victimization. RESULTS: Overall, depressed men were most often victimized by a stranger in public, and women by their partner or ex-partner at home. Regarding sexual assault, no gender differences could be examined. Patients were sexually assaulted most often by an acquaintance (50.0%) or stranger (27.8%). In all patients, the most recent incidents of threat (67.6%) and physical assault (80.0%) were often preceded by a conflict, and only a minority had been intoxicated prior to the assault.

Chi-square was used to assess gender and disorder associations; logistic regression was used to model additive effects of abuse and calculate the attributable fraction of abuse to disorder prevalence. RESULTS: Higher rates of sexual abuse were reported by women (35.3%) and men (11.5%) with functional movement disorders compared to controls (10.6% of women; 5.6% of men). History of sexual abuse increased the likelihood of functional movement disorders among women by an odds ratio of 4.57 (95% confidence interval 2.31-9.07; p < 0.0001) and physical abuse by an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% confidence interval 1.53-5.12; p = 0.0007).

This study sought to provide a qualitative assessment of harassment and discrimination experienced by female physicians in emergency medicine (EM) specifically by colleagues or supervisors. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to female EM physicians on October 18, 2018, asking if they have felt harassed, diminished, uncomfortable, or discriminated against by a male colleague or supervisor at work based on a sexual comment or unwanted advance. Space for descriptive experiences was provided. A data abstraction tool was developed, and experiences were placed into thematic categories. The survey was closed on December 18, 2018, and data were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 1280 responses. Responses that were incomplete, not attributable to women, and outside of EM were excluded leaving 1144 to be analyzed. Respondents were primarily White (81%) and working in nonacademic environments (53.5%). The majority (57.3%) felt harassed, diminished, uncomfortable, or discriminated against by a male colleague or superior at work based on sexual comment or innuendo; 22.3% experienced an unwanted sexual act or advance. There were 482 descriptive experiences reported, most frequently focusing on patronizing behavior (16.5%), pregnancy/maternity leave (15.9%), and physical appearance (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Women in EM experience sexual harassment and discrimination at work by their peers and supervisors.

However, there are currently limited qualitative studies examining the nature of SH, GB, and GD in academic medicine, particularly family medicine. METHODS: In 2018, we conducted a series of gender-specific focus groups with faculty and residents in a department of family medicine (DFM) to understand their experiences with and responses to SH, GB, and GD. The focus groups were transcribed verbatim. We used immersion-crystallization and an adapted SH Experiences model to review the transcripts and identify patterns or themes during the immersion process. RESULTS: Participants identified the potential for patients, colleagues, faculty, and themselves as perpetrators and victims of SH, GB, and GD. Results suggested that GB was often implicit. SH was experienced verbally and physically. Women participants, especially, reported that both SH and GB occurred frequently and had lasting psychological effects.

The Impact of National-Level Gender Inequality on the Sexual Abuse of Girls.,LeSuer W,"Feminist scholars from various social science disciplines posit that gender inequality (GI) is harmful to women's well-being. Feminist criminologists argue that GI is criminogenic, especially of sexual violence. I apply this framework to a specific form of sexual violence: child sexual abuse (CSA). Using multilevel generalized linear modeling to analyze the responses of 10,106 women from 27 countries in the International Dating Violence Study, I test for significant associations between national-level GI and self-reported retrospective reports of CSA. While controlling for other risk factors, I find that GI is significantly associated with increased odds of having experienced CSA among women.",2022,Mar,Violence Against Women,28,3-4,691-710,,10.1177/10778012211005563,34269134,#97,LeSuer 2022,"",""
The Current State of Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment in the Radiology Workplace: A Survey.,Pitot MA; White MA; Edney E; Mogensen MA; Solberg A; Kattapuram T; Kadom N,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (1) to determine the extent to which gender discrimination and sexual harassment are experienced by female radiologists and trainees; (2) to examine whether experiencing harassment or discrimination influences perceptions of gender parity; and (3) to explore whether the existence of either formal institutional policies or the number of women in the workplace and/or in leadership positions influences perceptions of having achieved gender equity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online anonymous questionnaire, developed through an Association of University Radiologists (AUR) - affiliated 2019-2020 Task Force, was used to assess participant demographics, perceptions of gender parity, and experiences of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. RESULTS: A total of 375 complete responses were collected. All respondents were female with most practices consisting of fewer than 25% female radiologists. The majority of respondents reported having been a victim of sexual harassment (n = 226, 60.3%) and gender discrimination (n = 318, 84.8%) in the workplace. Approximately 87.5% of participants believed workplace gender parity would take longer than 10 years to achieve; 26.9% responded that it will never happen. Experiencing gender discrimination or harassment in the workplace was significantly associated with a negative outlook on achieving gender parity. Conversely, the presence and number of adequate formal institutional policies to address workplace gender equity and harassment were significantly associated with optimistic views on achieving gender parity. Higher percentages of women in one's practice as well as number of women in leadership positions were also significantly associated with more optimistic expectations. CONCLUSION: Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are common in the field of radiology and influence victims' outlook on achieving gender parity in the workplace. Perceptions can be improved by implementing adequate institutional training policies on harassment and increasing the representation of female radiologists.",2022,Mar,Acad Radiol,29,3,416-425,,10.1016/j.acra.2021.01.002,33495074,#98,Pitot 2022,"",""
Social perception of sexual harassment in informal relations.,Drążkowski D; Ganclerz M,"BACKGROUND: Perception of sexual harassment in informal relations is a largely uninvestigated topic. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining the effect of the type of relationship between the perpetrator and the victim on the perception of harassment. Furthermore, we considered potential factors moderating the tested relationships: acceptance of gender stereotypes and sex. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: In total, 369 participants were assigned to one of three conditions including a female victim and a male perpetrator who was either her neighbor, coworker, or supervisor. RESULTS: The participants assessed the harasser to be responsible. The supervisor's behavior was considered more punishable than that of the colleague or neighbor. The male participants reported that the perpetrator was less deserving of punishment than female participants.

Mental health consequences of military sexual trauma: results from a national survey in the French military.,Moreau C; Duron S; Bedretdinova D; Bohet A; Panjo H; Bajos N; Meynard JB,"BACKGROUND: Military sexual trauma (MST) is a major public health concern, given its prevalence and mental health sequelae. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent among women in the US military, although more cases involve men given their overrepresentation. Little is known about MST and its consequences in other military settings, including in Europe. METHODS: This study draws from a national survey in the French military, including 1268 servicemen and 232 servicewomen. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis, using simple and multinomial logistic regressions to evaluate the associations between different forms of MST (repeated sexual comments alone/one form of sexual oppression (coercion, repeated verbal unwanted attention or assault)/ several sexual stressors) and symptoms of depression and of positive post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screening scores. RESULTS: Women were both more likely to experience MST and to experience more severe forms of MST than men. Women were also more likely than men to report mental health symptoms (31% versus 18% for symptoms of depression and 4.0% versus 1.8% for positive PTSD screening scores). Different forms of MST were associated with different levels of psychological distress. Women reporting repeated sexual comments alone had higher odds of depressive symptoms (OR=3.1 [1.7, 5.5]) relative to women with no MST. Likewise, the odds of depressive symptoms were 6.5 times higher among women and 8.0 times higher among men who experienced several sexual stressors relative to those who reported no MST. We also found higher relative risk of subthreshold PTSD screening scores among women reporting any form of sexual stressor, including sexual comments alone (RRR = 4.5 [2.8, 7.4]) and an elevenfold increase in the relative risk of positive PTSD screen scores (RRR = 11.3 [2.3, 55.6]) among women who experienced several sexual stressors relative to women with no MST. CONCLUSION: MST is associated with mental health distress among service members in the French military, especially for women. The heightened risk of MST coupled with psychological sequelae call for preventive programs to reduce MST and for screening programs to provide adequate psychological support.",2022,Feb,BMC Public Health,22,1,214,,10.1186/s12889-022-12545-x,35109815,#100,Moreau 2022,"",""

DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted an online survey using a questionnaire of 9 multiple-choice and 2 open questions between 24 January 2019 and 24 February 2019. Our target population was medical students and physicians working at hospitals and general practitioners from the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The online survey was sent via social media platforms and direct emails. We compared answers between male-determined and female-determined respondents using either χ(2) or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Among 1071 responders, a total of 893 were included (625 females, 264 males, 4 non-binary and 1 non-binary and male). 178 were excluded because they did not mention their working place or were working only outside Switzerland.

"Examining Associations Between Participant Gender, Desired Partner Gender, and Views Toward Sexually Coercive Behaviors.",DelPriore DJ,"Sexual coercion-pursuit of sexual activity with a partner who has not provided full consent (Huppin & Malamuth, Sexual Coercion, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2015) is a pervasive problem that carries psychological and financial costs. Although much past research has focused on sexually coercive acts performed by men and directed at women, the current work evaluates the independent and interactive roles of participant gender, desired partner gender, and sexual orientation in predicting individuals' views toward sexual coercion, a psychological outcome linked with coercive sexual behavior (e.g., Zinzow & Thompson in Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44:213-222, 2015). To this end, 1021 cisgender men and women (M (age) = 26.46 years) who self-identified as heterosexual, gay/lesbian, or bisexual rated the acceptability of sexually coercive behaviors performed by individuals of their gender. Consistent with past behavioral research, men rated these acts to be more acceptable when performed by same-gender others than did women. Extending past research, this gender difference was observed across variation in desired partner genders and sexual orientations. Further, an attraction to women predicted higher acceptability ratings among men but not among women. Finally, identification as heterosexual (as compared to gay/lesbian or bisexual) predicted more favorable views toward these behaviors across participant gender. Taken together, these findings suggest that men who are attracted to women (specifically) may be most likely to view coercive behaviors as acceptable, and thus may be most likely to utilize them, when pursuing sexual activity.

"Female Arab teenagers' involvement in antisocial behavior: Intersection of perceived ethnonational discrimination, sexual victimization, and affiliation with delinquent peers.",Jeries-Loulou LJ; Khoury-Kassabri M,"Based on intersectionality theory, the present study examined the contribution of direct, indirect, and interactive effects of individual, family, peer, and contextual factors on violence against others among female Arab teenagers. The study is based on a sample of 193 at-risk teenagers aged 12-21 (M = 16.5), who completed questionnaires in their out-of-home care settings. Almost 60% of participants reported having perpetrated at least one moderate act of physical violence against others at least once during the preceding month. More than one-third (40%) had experienced at least one incident of sexual victimization during their lives. In addition, almost two-thirds (61%) reported experiencing at least one incident of ethnonational discrimination at least once during the past year. The findings also showed that the association between sexual victimization and moderate physical violence against others was mediated by the teenagers' affiliation with delinquent peers and moderated by perceived ethnonational discrimination. Finally, for participants with medium or high levels of perceived ethnonational discrimination, the associations between sexual victimization and perpetration of moderate physical violence, and between sexual victimization and peer delinquency, were stronger than for participants with low perceived discrimination. Examining the association between sexual victimization and violence perpetration is important, especially among at-risk teenagers in a conservative society, which expects victimized adolescents and young women to remain silent, given that silencing increases the risk of victims' involvement in delinquency and antisocial behavior. Intervention programs should be sensitive to the special situation of at-risk teenagers who experience marginalization consisting of several risk factors, including membership in an ethnonational minority and a traditional society in the context of a political conflict.

Pathways to and factors associated with rape stigma experienced by rape survivors in South Africa: Analysis of baseline data from a rape cohort.,Jewkes R; Mhlongo S; Chirwa E; Seedat S; Myers B; Peer N; Garcia-Moreno C; Dunkle K; Abrahams N,"Rape stigma, both external and self-stigmatization (self-blame), is associated with adverse health outcomes. Understanding its origins and resilience factors is critical for reducing and preventing it. We describe the prevalence of rape stigma, the characteristics of women experiencing it and the pathways to experiencing greater stigma. The Rape Impact Cohort Evaluation study enrolled 852 women aged 16-40 years who had been raped from post-rape care centres in Durban, South Africa. We present a descriptive analysis of the baseline data, a multinomial logistic regression model of factors associated with different levels of stigma and a structural equation model (SEM). Most women reported stigmatizing thoughts or experiences, with self-stigmatizing thoughts being more prevalent than external stigmatization. The multinomial model showed that experiences of childhood or other trauma, emotional intimate partner violence (IPV), having less gender equitable attitudes and food insecurity were significantly associated with medium or high versus low levels of stigma. Internal and external stigma were significantly associated with each other. Women who had been previously raped reported less stigma. The SEM showed a direct path between food insecurity and rape stigma, with poorer women experiencing more stigma. Indirect paths were mediated by more traditional gender attitudes and childhood trauma experience and other trauma exposure. Our findings confirm the intersectionality of rape stigma, with its structural drivers of food insecurity and gender inequality, as well as its strong association with prior trauma exposure.

Although the specialty's nature and its associated lifestyle are potential barriers, gender-related issues may play an important part. PURPOSE: To evaluate the gender discrimination among spine surgeons across Latin America. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PATIENT SAMPLE: The participants in this study were 223 AO Spine Latin America (AOSLA) registered members who answered the web-based survey. OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal and professional demographics; gender-related objective and subjective experiences regarding career and personal life. METHODS: A survey link containing a 24-item questionnaire was sent to the members' e-mails in September 2019. The survey was designed to evaluate the perception of gender discrimination by spine surgeons during their academic and professional lives. RESULTS: Out of 223 members who answered the survey, 196 (87.96%) were male and 27 (12.11%) female. Most were orthopedic surgeons (64.13%), ≥40 years of age (55.16%), and had <20 years of experience (69.95%). Gender discrimination was more frequent among women than among men (66.67% vs. 1.02%), as did discouragement from becoming a spine surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, or neurosurgeon (81.48% vs. 0.51%). Females reported higher rates of sexual harassment (44.44% vs. 7.65%) and more often felt disadvantaged because of gender (55.56% vs. 2.55%). Working harder than men to achieve the same prestige and lack of female mentorship were the most common obstacles reported by women (55.56%).

The second theme, ""experiencing sexual harassment at work as a man,"" presented experiences of sexual harassment as a male nurse and difficulties in being recognized as a victim. CONCLUSION: Gender discrimination and sexual harassment experienced by male nurses stem from a wide range of socio-cultural factors, ranging from individuals to organizations, and institutions.

"Race, Ethnicity, and Punishment for Federal Sex Offenses: Changing Composition in Child Pornography and Sex Abuse Cases and Temporal Disparity in Sentencing Over Time.",Hartley RD; Testa A; Martinez E,"In response to several high-profile violent offenses against children over the past two decades, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation aimed at increasing punishment for those convicted of federal sex offenses. Coinciding with these enhanced penalties was a demographic shift in the composition of those prosecuted for these offenses. In the federal criminal justice system, sex offenses fall into two main categories: child pornography and sexual abuse. The racial and ethnic makeup of individuals charged for federal sex offenses has significantly changed over the past 15 years. The current study utilizes federal sentencing data from the United States Sentencing Commission for the years 2006 to 2017 to explore the nature of punishment for these offenses over time. We also employ multivariate analyses to examine differences in punishment for the two types of offenses and employ disaggregated analyses by offense type to examine temporal change in racial/ethnic disparities in sentence length and departures from the federal sentencing guidelines. Findings demonstrate that convicted individuals who are Black and Hispanic are receiving harsher sentences over time net of controls for other key predictors such as age, sex, criminal history, and presumptive sentence length. Implications for how legislatively enhanced penalties and changing demographic makeup of those convicted for these offenses may have introduced extra-legal disparity into federal sentencing are further discussed.",2021,Dec,Sex Abuse,33,8,891-922,,10.1177/1079063220981062,33345715,#108,Hartley 2021,"",""
"Comparison Between Male and Female Survivors of Sexual Abuse and Assault in Relation to Age at Admission to Therapy, Age of Onset, and Age at Last Sexual Assault: Retrospective Observational Study.",Al-Asadi AM,"BACKGROUND: Sexual abuse and sexual assault are complex phenomena that involve many factors (or correlates) and have many health and financial implications for individuals, families, and society. Every correlate needs to be studied in detail, individually and in relation to other correlates. Only with a thorough understanding of these correlates can more efficient and targeted prevention and intervention programs be designed. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between male and female survivors of sexual abuse and sexual assault regarding the correlates of the survivors' age of onset of assault, age at the last assault, and age at which they entered therapy. METHODS: Therapists at eight sexual assault centers in the province of Alberta, Canada, completed a questionnaire on each of their clients over a period of 7 years. A total of 3302 participants, of whom 2901 (87.86%) were female and 401 (12.1%) were male survivors of sexual abuse and assault, were included in this study. Mostly descriptive analyses were carried out on the 4 variables of concern in this study. RESULTS: Regarding the number of survivors who sought therapy, female survivors outnumbered male survivors by a ratio of 7:1, with different ratios for different age groups. As children age, their risk of being sexually assaulted for the first time decreases. Male children are more likely to be sexually abused at a younger age, whereas female children are more vulnerable to being assaulted at all ages, particularly in adolescence. The mean age of onset of sexual abuse was found to be 6.71 (SD 2.86) years, and the odds of experiencing the first sexual assault during childhood, as opposed to adolescence, were 4:1 for females and 9:1 for males. Male survivors were two times more likely than female survivors to experience their first sexual assault in childhood. The vast majority of survivors sought help many years after being sexually assaulted, and male survivors waited an average of 3 years longer from the last sexual assault before seeking therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors of sexual abuse and sexual assault live with the consequences for many years before they seek help, and a large proportion of male survivors are not likely to seek help.",2021,Nov,JMIRx Med,2,4,e23713,,10.2196/23713,37725544,#109,Al-Asadi 2021,"",""

Little is known about gender differences in victimization types and in specific characteristics of victimization (e.g., perpetrator, location or disclosure). Knowledge on characteristics of victimization would provide clinicians with more insight which may be especially useful for tailoring interventions. The aim of this study is to examine gender differences in characteristics of violent and sexual victimization in patients with a psychotic disorder. METHODS: Information on violent (threats, physical abuse) and sexual victimization (harassment, assault) was assessed in 482 individuals with a psychotic disorder who received mental health care. Patients were recruited through a routine outcome monitoring study and a clinical trial. RESULTS: Men reported more threats with violence (20.7% vs. 10.5%, x(2) = 7.68, p = 0.01), whereas women reported more sexual assault (13.3% vs. 3.6%, x(2) = 15.43, p < 0.001). For violent victimization, women were more likely than men to be victimized by a partner, friend or family member (52.9% vs. 30.6%) as opposed to a stranger (11.8% vs. 40.3%; O.R. = 52.49) and to be victimized at home (60.0% vs. 29.3%) as opposed to on the street or elsewhere (40.0% vs. 70.3%; O.R. = 0.06). For sexual victimization, there was no difference in location and perpetrator between men and women. For sexual victimization and physical violence, no differences in disclosure were found, but women were more likely not to disclose threats with violence or to disclose threats to a professional or police (52.9% vs. 45.2%; O.R. = 30.33). All analyses were controlled for age, diagnosis and employment. DISCUSSION: Gender patterns of victimization types and characteristics are similar for individuals with a psychotic disorder in comparison to the general population. Men were at higher risk of violent victimization, whereas women were at higher risk for sexual victimization. Men were more likely to become victimized in the streets or elsewhere by a stranger, whereas women seemed to be more often victimized at home by a partner, friend or a family member.

[Dream job orthopedics and trauma surgery-This can also come true for women!].,Bühren A; Wenzel L,"BACKGROUND: At least two thirds of medical students are female. How can they be won over in the competition for the best heads and hands in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery? 25% of the inpatient surgeons are female, while the proportion of women in managerial positions is only 5%. GOAL OF THE WORK (QUESTION): How do the specialist field and the specialist society have to change in order to be attractive for the younger generation, and be regarded as a dream job? MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of surveys and scientific literature, the following problem areas are identified and highlighted: What do today's young doctors want? How should employers and superiors behave in relation to the women-specific life events of pregnancy, maternity leave and breastfeeding? How to enable female surgeons to continue operating as desired in accordance with the law? Often in clinics, care is not taken to provide female surgeons with individually sized instruments. A manufacturer survey was carried out for this purpose. How can we counteract the sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace? How can male and female professionals achieve a more equal balance between family and work in the clinic and practice? RESULTS: The Gender Bias, the glass ceiling, the lack of female role models and female mentors mean that female surgeons do not have equal opportunities. The gender pay gap and the gender care gap are discussed and presented with data. Significantly, there is a specific lack of data on the gender pay gap in Germany. The everyday clinical practice and the professional society are still a man's world. In order to attract a sufficient number of young professionals, the working environment and participation in committees must be transformed into a world that is equal for male and female surgeons.

Experiences of Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Among Residents in General Surgery Programs Across the US.,Schlick CJR; Ellis RJ; Etkin CD; Greenberg CC; Greenberg JA; Turner PL; Buyske J; Hoyt DB; Nasca TJ; Bilimoria KY; Hu YY,"IMPORTANCE: Mistreatment is a common experience among surgical residents and is associated with burnout. Women have been found to experience mistreatment at higher rates than men. Further characterization of surgical residents' experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment may inform solutions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the types, sources, and factors associated with (1) discrimination based on gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation and (2) sexual harassment experienced by residents in general surgery programs across the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional national survey study was conducted after the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE). The survey asked respondents about their experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment during the academic year starting July 1, 2018, through the testing date in January 2019. All clinical residents enrolled in general surgery programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education were eligible. EXPOSURES: Specific types, sources, and factors associated with gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was the prevalence of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Secondary outcomes included sources of discrimination and harassment and associated individual- and program-level factors using gender-stratified multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The survey was administered to 8129 eligible residents; 6956 responded (85.6% response rate)from 301 general surgery programs. Of those, 6764 residents had gender data available (3968 [58.7%] were male and 2796 [41.3%] were female individuals). In total, 1878 of 2352 female residents (79.8%) vs 562 of 3288 male residents (17.1%) reported experiencing gender discrimination (P < .001), and 1026 of 2415 female residents (42.5%) vs 721 of 3360 male residents (21.5%) reported experiencing sexual harassment (P < .001). The most common type of gender discrimination was being mistaken for a nonphysician (1943 of 5640 residents [34.5%] overall; 1813 of 2352 female residents [77.1%]; 130 of 3288 male residents [4.0%]), with patients and/or families as the most frequent source. The most common form of sexual harassment was crude, demeaning, or explicit comments (1557 of 5775 residents [27.0%] overall; 901 of 2415 female residents [37.3%]; 656 of 3360 male residents [19.5%]); among female residents, the most common source of this harassment was patients and/or families, and among male residents, the most common source was coresidents and/or fellows. Among female residents, gender discrimination was associated with pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.62) and higher ABSITE scores (highest vs lowest quartile: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.43); among male residents, gender discrimination was associated with parenthood (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.31-2.27) and lower ABSITE scores (highest vs lowest quartile: OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76). Senior residents were more likely to report experiencing sexual harassment than interns (postgraduate years 4 and 5 vs postgraduate year 1: OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.40-2.24] among female residents; 1.31 [95% CI, 1.01-1.70] among male residents).

Online sexual harassment and depression in Chilean adolescents: Variations based on gender and age of the offenders.,Guerra C; Pinto-Cortez C; Toro E; Efthymiadou E; Quayle E,"BACKGROUND: Online sexual harassment in adolescence is associated with depressive symptoms. There is, however, a dearth of research investigating variability of symptom profiles in this population in relation to offender gender and age. OBJECTIVE: To identify the proportion of adolescents reporting online harassment by different types of offenders and compare their levels of depression. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were 18,872 Chilean students aged 12 to 17 years (3.063 of them online sexually harassed). METHODS: The study involved a secondary analysis of self-report data on online sexual harassment, poly-victimization, and depression collected as part of the National Poly-victimization Survey. RESULTS: In 37.6% of the cases the offender was male under 18, in 22.4% an adult male, in 14.5% a female under 18, and in 2.9% an adult female. In 22.5% of cases the offender could not be identified. An ANCOVA demonstrated levels of poly-victimization across the lifespan and frequency of online sexual harassment in the last year to predict depressive symptomatology. In females, higher levels of depressive symptoms were observed among those sexually harassed by either a female under 18, an offender whose age and gender the victim could not identify, or an adult male. In males, higher levels of depression were observed among those harassed by either an adult male, an offender whose age and gender the victim could not identify, or a male under 18.

Challenges to Professional Success for Women Plastic Surgeons: An International Survey.,Naidu NS; Patrick PA; Bregman D; Jianu D,"BACKGROUND: Female plastic surgeons face specific challenges in their careers that impact lifestyle and professional choices. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to delineate these specific issues further through means of an anonymous survey and to suggest areas for improvement. METHODS: In August 2017, a link to an online email questionnaire via SurveyMonkey.com was sent to 398 women members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, which included questions on demographics, surgical training, practice characteristics and preferences, leadership and professional activities, marriage and childcare, financial status, workplace sexism and sexual harassment and surgeon attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 138 female plastic surgeons responded to the survey for a response rate of 34.7%. Critical issues most cited by respondents included work-life balance and childcare responsibilities, sexual harassment and the lack of gender parity at meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgery training programs, institutions and societies should acknowledge the additional challenges that female surgeons face. The greatest areas for improvement include the balance of work and family responsibilities, addressing the prevalence of sexual harassment and improved representation at scientific meetings.

Changes in Rape Myth Acceptance Among Undergraduates: 2010 to 2017.,Beshers S; DiVita M,"The objective of this study is to characterize changes in rape myth acceptance (RMA) among college students from 2010 to 2017. Two samples of undergraduates in a northeastern university in the United States participated in the study, consisting of 464 students in the fall semester of 2010 and 534 students in the spring semester of 2017. Participants took an anonymous web-based survey to measure levels of RMA. The instrument was a revised and updated version of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance scale. Data analysis was both descriptive and inferential. For all subscales and the overall total RMA, differences in scores by year of survey (2017 compared with 2010) were significant; 2017 scores were significantly lower than 2010 scores. The greatest differences were for the She asked for it and She lied subscales, 1.76 versus 2.62 (p < .001) and 2.26 versus 2.69 (p < .001), respectively.

Physical and Sexual Victimization Class Membership and Alcohol Misuse and Consequences among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Female Youth.,Scheer JR; Antebi-Gruszka N; Sullivan T,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence demonstrates sexual orientation disparities in physical and sexual victimization and alcohol misuse and consequences among female youth; however, most extant research has used variable-centered approaches. The current study used latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered approach, to: (1) model female youths' physical and sexual victimization; (2) examine sexual orientation disparities in physical and sexual victimization latent class membership; (3) and use physical and sexual victimization latent class membership to predict female youths' engagement in alcohol misuse and related consequences. METHOD: Participants were 7,185 youth assigned female sex at birth (77.0% heterosexual, 12.8% bisexual, 2.3% gay or lesbian; 46.8% racial minority) in grades 9 - 12 who completed the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey - a school-based, cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: LCA uncovered four classes: (1) ""Poly-Victimization Class,"" (2) ""No Victimization Class,"" (3) ""Past-Year Sexual Victimization Class,"" and (4) ""Lifetime Rape Class."" Sexual orientation emerged as a significant predictor of class membership. Latent classes 3 and 4 were uniquely associated with alcohol misuse and consequences (i.e., binge drinking, riding with a drinking driver, and drinking and driving) among female youth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings help to elucidate the patterns of physical and sexual victimization regarding timeline, tactic used, and context among female youth; sexual orientation disparities in latent class membership; and alcohol misuse correlates of class membership. Prevention efforts aimed at reducing physical and sexual victimization may ultimately reduce female youths' risk of binge drinking, riding with drinking drivers, and drinking and driving.",2021,Sep,Psychol Violence,11,5,434-444,,10.1037/vio0000380,35308039,#121,Scheer 2021,"",""
Trauma Symptoms Resulting From Sexual Violence Among Undergraduate Students: Differences Across Gender and Sexual Minority Status.,Paquette G; Martin-Storey A; Bergeron M; Dion J; Daigneault I; Hébert M; Ricci S; Castonguay-Khounsombath S,"Experiencing sexual violence is an important risk factor for trauma symptoms, and these symptoms significantly impair psychosocial functioning. Sexual and gender minority university students are more likely than their heterosexual and cisgender peers to experience sexual violence (e.g., sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual coercion) while attending university, but research on the consequences of these experiences is needed to inform service provision to these vulnerable populations. Using a large-scale study of university-based sexual violence in Quebec, the current study examined how gender and sexual minority status were associated with the severity of trauma symptoms among students who experienced sexual violence (N = 1,196). Findings indicated that compared with their cisgender peers, gender minority students experienced significantly higher levels of trauma symptoms as a result of sexual violence, controlling for the severity of sexual violence behaviors experienced and other variables. Among cisgender women, but not cisgender men, sexual minority identity was also associated with higher levels of trauma symptoms, controlling for severity of sexual violence behaviors experienced and other variables. Furthermore, gender of perpetrator and amount of sexual violence moderated the associations between sexual identity and trauma symptoms among cisgender women. These findings not only suggest that gender minority and some sexual minority university students are more likely to experience sexual violence, but that they are also more likely to experience negative psychological sequelae as a consequence of these experiences. Ultimately, these findings may suggest the need for services that are more supportive of the specific needs of gender and sexual minority students with regard to sexual violence.",2021,Sep,J Interpers Violence,36,17-18,NP9226-NP9251,,10.1177/0886260519853398,31195873,#122,Paquette 2021,"",""

Sexual aggression against males: Differences between acts by males and females - Results from the German Health and Sexuality Survey (GeSiD).,Tozdan S; Brunner F; Pietras L; Wiessner C; Briken P,"BACKGROUND: Current research examining sexual aggression against males is rare and representative studies often do not sufficiently differentiate between male and female affected persons, male and female offending person, as well as between different types of sexual aggression. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of sexual aggression against males perpetrated by males and females distinguished by the type of sexual aggression and examined differences between sexual aggression against males committed by males and females in characteristics of the sexual aggression. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We examined representative self-report data collected in the German Health and Sexuality Survey (GeSiD; n = 4,955). A total of 305 male participants (12.3 % of all male participants) experienced at least one incident of sexual aggression. METHOD: We investigated differences between characteristics of male- and female-perpetrated sexual aggression against males in cases of (1) sexual aggression against minors by adults, (2) sexual aggression among minors/peers, and (3) sexual aggression among adults. Characteristics of sexual aggression included were frequency, relation of accused person, disclosure, participant's age at first incident, and accused person's age at first incident. RESULTS: Our results revealed that the proportion of sexual aggression by females against males is rather low in cases of sexual aggression against minors by adults (9 %) compared with sexual aggression among minors/peers (56 %) and among adults (52 %). Although the majority of characteristics of sexual aggression were similar, some differences between male- and female-perpetrated sexual aggression were found. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual aggression against males appears to be an under-researched phenomenon, especially when it is perpetrated by a female person.

A Report of Gender Bias and Sexual Harassment in Current Plastic Surgery Training: A National Survey.,Chen W; Schilling BK; Bourne DA; Myers S; De La Cruz C,"BACKGROUND: Gender bias and sexual misconduct continue to pervade medicine. The authors hypothesize that gender bias and sexual misconduct disproportionately and negatively affect female plastic surgery trainees. METHODS: A national survey of plastic surgery trainees (2018 to 2019) was conducted using previously validated sexual harassment surveys adapted for relevance to plastic surgery. Respondents were queried about experiences with workplace gender bias and harassment; personal and professional impact; and reporting practices. Analyses included chi-square, logistic regression, and analysis of variance. Significance was accepted for values of p < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 236 responses (115 female respondents; 20.1 percent response rate). Most respondents were Caucasian (Asian/Pacific Islander, n = 34) residents (n = 123). The feeling of hindrance to career advancement was greater for women, by 10-fold (p < 0.001), and increased with age (p = 0.046). Women felt uncomfortable challenging attitudes regarding gender inequality (p < 0.001), regardless of training levels (p = 0.670) or race (p = 0.300). Gender bias diminished female trainees' career goals/ambition (p < 0.001). Women were more likely to experience sexual harassment, in the form of jokes (p = 0.003) and comments about their body or sexuality (p = 0.014). Respondents reported the majority of perpetrators of harassment to be attending physicians (30 percent) and other trainees (37 percent). Most common reasons to not report incidents included ""futility"" (29 percent) and ""fear"" (20 percent). Women experienced at least three symptoms of depression/anxiety, significantly higher than men (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gender bias and sexual misconduct negatively affect female trainees' attitudes toward their career. Two-thirds of cases of sexual harassment originate from other physicians. Minority trainees are less prepared to address transgressions and more likely to experience sexual coercion. Trainees perceive a culture nonconducive to reporting. These findings can guide changes and discussions surrounding workplace culture in plastic surgery training.",2021,Jun,Plast Reconstr Surg,147,6,1454-1468,,10.1097/PRS.0000000000007994,34019520,#127,Chen 2021,"",""

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: SVSeD-Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Female victims of sexual violence aged 10 years and older. Two study groups were analysed: an adolescent group and an adult group. INTERVENTIONS: None; this was an observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characteristics of the perpetrator, time spent between the episode of sexual violence and the access to SVSeD, presence of genital and/or extragenital injuries; tests for sexually transmitted diseases, spermatozoa research; and toxicological screening; RESULTS: Adolescent victims of sexual violence requested help later than the adult victims. The majority of the perpetrators were well known to the victims in both groups. In both groups, we observed genital injuries in 1 of 3 patients. We found a strong association between the presence of genital injuries and a positive screening test for sexually transmitted diseases, in particular with regard to the adolescent victims.

Discriminating between consensual intercourse and sexual assault: Genital-anal injury pattern in females.,Sommers MS; Fargo JD,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of genital-anal (GA) injuries following sexual assault promotes health and assists prosecutors to build a case. The pattern of injuries may help differentiate between consensual and non-consensual intercourse, bolster the survivors' credibility, and increase prosecutions in sexual assault cases. OBJECTIVES: To identify the constellation of G-A injury-related characteristics that most effectively discriminated between consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault in females when controlling for intercourse-related variables. METHODS: We employed a comparative study with two groups: a prospective cohort group with consensual participants and a group derived from an existing sexual assault registry. In the prospective cohort, we performed a sexual assault forensic examination at baseline and following consensual sexual intercourse with females ≥21 years. We compared their injury patterns to the injury records of females ≥21 years who were sexual assaulted. RESULTS: We enrolled a sample of 834 females: 528 consensual (63.3%) participants and 306 non-consensual (36.7%) registry cases. After controlling for race/ethnicity, age, and time between intercourse and examination, logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of an external genital tear increased the odds of non-consensual intercourse more than two times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.28-5.56). Logistic regression analyses also showed that the odds of non-consensual sexual intercourse were significantly greater with a lower prevalence and frequency of external and internal genital redness, lack of condom use and lubrication, and presence of anal penetration. Latent class analysis identified high and low G-A injury prevalence subgroups among both consensual and non-consensual samples. One subset of results emerged that may be indicative of non-consensual as compared to consensual intercourse: a higher prevalence of external genital and anal tears. CONCLUSION: External genital tears occurred more frequently in the non-consensual sample and increased the odds of non-consensual intercourse more than two times. Anal tears, swelling, and ecchymosis and anal penetration were markers for non-consensual intercourse and should increase suspicion for lack of consent.",2021,Apr,J Forensic Leg Med,79,,102138,,10.1016/j.jflm.2021.102138,33657467,#129,Sommers 2021,"",""
Gender and career in cardiology-a cross-sectional study.,Dettmer S; Wenzel A; Trenkwalder T; Tiefenbacher C; Regitz-Zagrosek V,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of women as leading physicians in cardiology in university medicine has stagnated and the share of women in senior positions in cardiology is low compared with other medical specialist fields. Here, we analyze the typical barriers for women as doctors in cardiology and point to issues that make the discipline less attractive for both genders. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a standardized online questionnaire was sent to 3873 members of the German Cardiac Society (DGK). Answers from 567 (278 women, 289 men) were analyzed, using comparisons between groups, correlation analyses, and tests of normal distribution. RESULTS: For 47.4% of respondents (52.0%, of women; 42.8%, of men; p = 0.049), training had lasted longer than anticipated. Average monthly gross income (full-time work) differed significantly between women and men as specialists (p = 0.004) and assistant doctors (p = 0.030). Of women, 32.1% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The main arguments against a career in university medicine were an extremely competitive working climate (66.7% of women, 63.2% of men), lack of work-life balance (66.7% women, 55.3% men), and excessive workload (57.8% women, 62.5% men). As strategies to increase job attractiveness, both mentioned measures to improve the work-life balance, and the flexibility of working times and improved financial provision. Women asked for gender balance at management level (76.3% vs. 32.9% of men) and opportunities for sharing management tasks (82.4% vs. 57.9%). Flatter hierarchies were requested by more men (67.1 vs. 54.8%). CONCLUSION: Further development of the work culture in cardiology seems necessary.

Tools for Responding to Patient-Initiated Verbal Sexual Harassment: A Workshop for Trainees and Faculty.,Hock LE; Barlow PB; Scruggs BA; Oetting TA; Martinez DA; Abràmoff MD; Shriver EM,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are the most common source of gender-based harassment of resident physicians, yet residents receive little training on how to handle it. Few resources exist for residents wishing to address patient-initiated verbal sexual harassment themselves. METHODS: We developed, taught, and evaluated a 50-minute workshop to prepare residents and faculty to respond to patient-initiated verbal sexual harassment toward themselves and others. The workshop used an interactive lecture and role-play scenarios to teach a tool kit of communication strategies for responding to harassment. Participants completed retrospective pre-post surveys on their ability to meet the learning objectives and their preparedness to respond. RESULTS: Ninety-one participants (57 trainees, 34 faculty) completed surveys at one of five workshop sessions across multiple departments. Before the workshop, two-thirds (67%) had experienced patient-initiated sexual harassment, and only 28 out of 59 (48%) had ever addressed it. Seventy-five percent of participants had never received training on responding to patient-initiated sexual harassment. After the workshop, participants reported significant improvement in their preparedness to recognize and respond to all forms of patient-initiated verbal sexual harassment (p < .01), with the greatest improvements noted in responding to mild forms of verbal sexual harassment, such as comments on appearance or attractiveness or inappropriate jokes (p < .01). DISCUSSION: This workshop fills a void by preparing residents and faculty to respond to verbal sexual harassment from patients that is not directly observed.

The anonymous online questionnaire was sent as a link to all medical undergraduates at Münster Medical School via a mailing list between 1 October and 30 November 2018. Identifying or potentially identifying data were not collected. Data were analysed by descriptive statistical methods such as categorical variables. Baseline characteristics, e.g. answers by male or female medical students, were correlated with their individual sexual harassment experiences and perpetrator groups by means of univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2162 medical students were asked to participate, with 623 (28.8%) completing the survey. Sexual harassment is a significant issue among medical students at Münster Medical School with over half (58.9%) of all undergraduates being exposed to sexually harassing behaviour. In total, 31.8% of all participants reported having experienced unwanted physical sexual contact such as unwanted physical touching, with 87.6% of the victims being female. Overall, 41.3% personally experienced verbal sexual harassment of which 87.4% were female. Furthermore, 8.5% of undergraduates faced forced sexual contact such as oral, anal or vaginal penetration, intercourse and rape, with all victims being female. Perpetrators in these cases were mostly male medical superiors (7.0%) and male patients (18.3%). In general, most perpetrators were patients, followed by medical superiors and educators, and less frequently by colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual harassment in medical education and the medical workplace is a significant problem in a German medical school. Most students experiencing sexual harassment are females. Female students also experience the more serious forms of sexual harassment more often.",2021,Feb,BMC Med Educ,21,1,81,,10.1186/s12909-021-02497-y,33526025,#133,Schoenefeld 2021,"",""

Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Among Academic Internal Medicine Hospitalists.,Bhandari S; Jha P; Cooper C; Slawski B,"BACKGROUND: Gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment, both implicit and overt, have been reported in academic medicine. This study examines experiences of academic hospitalists regarding gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment. METHODS: A survey was distributed to Internal Medicine hospitalists at university-based academic institutions in the United States. Questions assessed experiences regarding gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment in their interactions with patients, as well as with other healthcare providers (HCPs). RESULTS: Eighteen institutions participated in the survey, resulting in 336 individual responses. Female hospitalists more frequently reported inappropriate touch, sexual remarks, gestures, and suggestive looks by patients compared with male peers both over their careers (P < .001) and in the last 30 days (P < .001). Similarly, females more frequently reported being referred to with inappropriate terms of endearment (eg, ""dear,"" ""honey,"" ""sweetheart"") by patients both over their careers (P < .001) and in the last 30 days (P < .001). Almost 100% of females reported being mistaken by patients for nonphysician HCPs over their careers, compared with 29% of males (P < .001) (76% vs 10%, in the last 30 days; P < .001). Similarly, females more frequently reported sexual harassment over their careers (P < .05) and being mistaken for nonphysician HCPs by colleagues both over their careers (P < .001) and in the last 30 days (P < .001). Females rated their sense of respect both by patients (P < .001) and colleagues (P < .001) lower than males (P < .001). More females than males reported that gender negatively impacted their career opportunities (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrates that gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment are commonly encountered by academic hospitalists, with a significantly higher number of females reporting these experiences.",2021,Feb,J Hosp Med,16,2,84-89,,10.12788/jhm.3533,33496657,#135,Bhandari 2021,"",""
Psychopathic Traits and Sexual Coercion Against Relationship Partners in Men and Women.,Hoffmann AM; Verona E,"The present study examined the relationships between psychopathic traits, gender, and sexual coercion perpetration in the specific context of intimate partner relationships. Community-dwelling adult men and women with recent criminal or substance-use histories (N = 300) completed self-report measures of psychopathic personality traits (interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial facets), sexual coercion perpetrated within their most recent relationship, and other relevant behaviors including physical intimate partner violence perpetration and sexual coercion victimization. Results of regression analyses showed that the relationship between psychopathic trait facets and sexual coercion was moderated by gender, with effects varying based on level of coercion severity. Specifically, women who showed high levels of interpersonal psychopathic traits (superficial charm, social dominance) were more likely to engage in any sexual coercion and minor severity sexual coercion than women with low levels of interpersonal traits. For severe coercion, women who showed low levels of affective psychopathic traits (coldness, lack of empathy) or high levels of antisocial psychopathic traits (aggressiveness, criminality) were more likely to be sexually coercive than other women. Relationships between the four psychopathic trait facets and sexual coercion were more modest and nonsignificant for men at any level of coercion severity. Results are discussed in the context of sociocultural factors that may influence the role of psychopathic traits on sexual coercion as a function of gender and relationship contexts, including traditional sexual scripts, the cultural role of women as sexual gatekeepers, and beliefs about token resistance.",2021,Feb,J Interpers Violence,36,3-4,NP1788-1809NP,,10.1177/0886260518754873,29380653,#136,Hoffmann 2021,"",""
Sex differences in the effects of physical and sexual abuse on the odds of past 30-day opioid misuse among Florida justice-involved children.,Johnson ME; Zaidi F,"AIM: Opioid misuse is a severe threat to justice-involved children and adolescents. Identifying risk factors and sex differences is critical to design accurate risk assessments and person-centered interventions. Stress theory and research posit that abuse may be linked to opioid misuse, and the consequences may be harsher for females. The study tests the hypothesis that physical and sexual abuse will individually and cumulatively increase the risk for opioid misuse, and females will have a higher risk than males. METHODS: A statewide sample of 79,960 justice-involved children in Florida were examined. Opioid misuse, illicit and non-medical use, was measured by urine analysis or self-disclosure within the past-30 days. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed. Marginal effects were estimated to investigate the interaction between abuse and sex. RESULTS: Over 2000 youth met the criteria for opioid misuse. One-third of female opioid users experienced both physical and sexual abuse. Compared to those with no history of physical or sexual abuse, those who were physically abused had 43% higher odds of opioid misuse, those who were sexually abuse had 78% higher odds, and those who experienced both had twice as high odds of opioid misuse. The individual and combined effects of these abuse types were higher for females. For example, female youth who were sexually abused had 2.7-times higher odds of opioid misuse than males who were sexually abused. CONCLUSION: Intervention efforts can be improved by integrating physical and sexual abuse into risk assessments and tailoring assessments by sex.",2021,,Addict Res Theory,29,6,479-489,,10.1080/16066359.2021.1891414,35035335,#137,Johnson 2021,"",""

"Sexual violence as a mediator of sexual orientation disparities in alcohol use, suicidality, and sexual-risk behaviour among female youth.",Scheer JR; McConocha E; Behari K; Pachankis JE,"Sexual violence exposure represents a serious public health issue among female youth given its association with female youths' engagement in health-risk behaviours. Sexual minority female youth are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence exposure, alcohol use, suicidality, and sexual-risk behaviour. Using the population-based 2017 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, we examined sexual violence as a mediator of sexual orientation disparities in health-risk behaviours among female youth. This study included 7,532 female students in grades 9 through 12 across the US. Participants identified their sexual orientation as heterosexual (73.5%); bisexual (12.2%); and, gay or lesbian (2.2%). Compared to heterosexual female youth, sexual violence exposure, alcohol use, binge drinking, and multiple sex partners were more common among bisexual female youth. The elevated risk of suicidality was most notable among gay or lesbian female youth relative to heterosexual female youth and bisexual female youth relative to heterosexual female youth. Mediation analyses showed that sexual violence exposure partially explained the sexual orientation disparity in these co-occurring health-risk behaviours between bisexual female youth and heterosexual female youth.

Medical students' self-reported gender discrimination and sexual harassment over time.,Kisiel MA; Kühner S; Stolare K; Lampa E; Wohlin M; Johnston N; Rask-Andersen A,"BACKGROUND: Gender discrimination (GD) and sexual harassment (SH) occur at all academic institutions worldwide. Medical students report high prevalence of GD and SH, which may negatively affect their education and health. There are indications that policies and reforms on reducing GD/SH are insufficient. Swedish medical students' experiences of GD/SH are monitored by course-evaluations and bi-annual student union evaluations; however, the response rate is usually low. The aim of this study was to compare the exposure to and context of self-reported GD/SH over an 11-year period amongst medical students at a Swedish university. METHODS: In 2002, a questionnaire (n = 622) was mailed to medical students' home addresses. It was repeated in 2013 and then distributed during mandatory lectures (n = 856). The questions used a behavioristic approach and asked about specific GH/SH experiences. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The changes in prevalence over time were calculated by sampling weights in order to obtain comparable estimates, representative of both cohorts. RESULTS: The response frequency was 55% (62% women) in 2002 and 81% (59% women) in 2013. The prevalence of GD tended to decrease for male and clinical students in comparison to female and pre-clinical peers. However, the prevalence of SH increased for female compared to male students. The ratio of SH for female pre-clinical students doubled in many instances; most often, the mistreatment occurred in the clinic. Medical doctors were indicated as perpetrators up to five times more often by all students in 2013. CONCLUSION: Our results show a disproportional change in exposure to GD/SH between female and male medical students, resulting in a widening of the gender gap regarding prevalence of GD and SH between 2002 and 2013. In particular, personal experiences of SH increased for both sexes. It is proof that institutional efforts to fight mistreatment might be ineffective.",2020,Dec,BMC Med Educ,20,1,503,,10.1186/s12909-020-02422-9,33302936,#140,Kisiel 2020,"",""

In this commentary, we discuss the results of an anonymous, online survey that assessed perceived effects of gender bias and sexual harassment on professional development among women dermatologists. The large majority of respondents reported experiencing significant gender-based obstacles to career advancement in either their current or past practice settings. Lack of equal professional support between men and women and discrimination based on parental status were commonly noted themes. A majority of respondents also reported having experienced some form of sexual harassment in the workplace.

METHODS: We conducted a survey of US physician members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Participants were queried about demographics, sexual harassment experiences during training/practice, and perceptions of gender disparities in compensation and career advancement. Responses were categorized as ""never"" versus ""ever"" and compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 1566 members-405 (255 females, 147 males, 3 other) responded (response rate 26%). Sixty-four percent reported having experienced sexual harassment during training/practice. Sexual harassment was experienced by 71% of females and 51% of males. Of these respondents, only 14.5% reported it. Reasons for not reporting included: ""incident did not seem important enough"" (40%); ""did not think anything would be done about it"" (37%); and ""fear of reprisal"" (34%). Female respondents were more likely to report gender affected their career advancement (34% vs. 10%; p ≤ .001) and compensation (64% vs. 19%; p ≤ .001); males were more likely to report no gender income disparity (91% vs. 57%; p ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual harassment during training/practice appears common among male and female gynecologic oncologists. Although most are aware of how to report an incident, few do so, mostly for fear of reprisal or concern nothing will be done.

A Quantitative Study on Gender Differences in Disclosing Child Sexual Abuse and Reasons for Nondisclosure.,Okur P; van der Knaap LM; Bogaerts S,"Despite the available literature on disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA), little is known about how gender affects disclosure. This article aims to quantitatively examine whether gender differences exist in formal (to legal or child protection authorities) and informal (to a family member or friend) disclosure of CSA and, if so, to assess whether this relation is associated with abuse characteristics and attitudes toward gender roles. The study also aimed to examine whether gender differences exist in reasons not to disclose CSA. Data of a sample of 586 participants, who reported to have experienced CSA committed by a single person, have been used for the analyses. There were no gender differences for formal disclosure, but the informal disclosure rate of CSA was 2.4 times higher for women than men, and this effect remained significant after controlling for abuse characteristics and attitudes, even though the gender difference decreased slightly. Furthermore, women and men reported different reasons for not disclosing CSA in their personal network. Women were more worried than men that family and friends would discover the abuse and reported more insecurity of what to do in this situation. Professionals in the field of CSA should consider a gender perspective when developing guidelines. Men have rarely been the subject of studies of disclosure after CSA.

AIM: This online study examined sexual abuse history and hypersexuality by gender among 16,823 Hungarian adults, adjusting for age, sexual orientation, relationship status, education, employment status, and residence. METHODS: An online questionnaire on one of the largest Hungarian news portals advertised this study examining sexual activities in January 2017. 3 categorizations of age-related sexual abuse were examined: child sexual abuse (CSA) occurring at age 13 and earlier (compared to no abuse), adolescent/adult sexual abuse (AASA; compared to no abuse), and CSA and AASA (CSA/AASA; compared to one age-related category of abuse or the other). OUTCOMES: The outcome variable, hypersexuality, was examined as a continuous variable due to the low prevalence of clinical hypersexuality in this sample. 3 multivariate linear regression analyses adjusting for covariates aimed to predict hypersexuality from each category of abuse, along with gender and its interaction with each category. RESULTS: In all models, younger age, non-heterosexual sexual orientation, male gender, single relationship status, less than full-time work, and living in a capital city were associated with hypersexuality, and education was not a significant predictor. CSA, AASA, and CSA/AASA predicted hypersexuality in both men and women. There was a significant interaction between CSA/AASA and gender, such that the relationship between CSA/AASA and hypersexuality was stronger in men than in women. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Sexual abuse at each developmental time-point may influence hypersexuality among men and women, although the cumulative impact of CSA and AASA on hypersexuality may be particularly relevant among men. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the largest studies to examine gender-related differences in the relationship between sexual abuse and hypersexuality. Nevertheless, our study is cross-sectional, and longitudinal work is needed to determine how sexual abuse affects children, adolescents, and adults throughout their lives.

It is known to be more pervasive in male-dominated workplaces and flourishes in a climate of tolerance and culture of silence. We sought to examine its prevalence in faculty of vascular surgery training programs, to identify factors associated with occurrence, to determine reporting barriers, and to identify any gender bias that exists. METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of questions on gender bias and sexual harassment was e-mailed to vascular surgery faculty members at 52 training sites in the United States. The survey asked about type, perpetrators, and locations; why and how the practice occurs; reporting mechanisms and barriers to reporting; and demographic information. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 346 invitations sent, 149 recipients (43%) completed the survey. Of respondents, 48 of 149 (32%) thought harassment occurred more commonly in surgical specialties with historical male dominance, citing ignoring of behavior and hierarchy/power dynamics as the most common reasons for its occurrence; 61 of 149 (41%) reported having experienced workplace harassment, with unwanted sexually explicit comments or questions and jokes, being called a sexist slur or nickname, or being paid unwanted flirtation as the most common behaviors. Harassment was high in both men and women, although women had a higher likelihood of being harassed (67% of women respondents vs 34% of men respondents; P = .001) and on average had experienced 2.6 (of 11) types of harassment. The majority of harassment came from hospital staff, although women were more likely to receive harassment from other faculty. Despite that 84% of respondents acknowledged known institutional reporting mechanisms, only 7.2% of the harassing behaviors were reported. The most common reasons for not reporting included feeling that the behavior was ""harmless"" (67%) or ""nothing positive would come of it"" (28%).

Gender Parity at Work and Its Association With Workplace Sexual Harassment.,Raj A; Johns NE; Jose R,"Background: Gender parity in the workplace-and increased representation of women at work-may reduce workplace sexual harassment, but research on this is unclear. This study assessed the associations between gender parity at work and workplace sexual harassment. Methods: We analyzed data from an online sexual harassment survey conducted with a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults in 2018 (N = 2,009; response rate 29%); current analyses were restricted to employed participants (women n = 610, men n = 690). Data on occupation and industry were each categorized as female-dominant (61%-100% female), male-dominant (0%-39% female), or at parity (40%-60% female). We used sex-stratified logistic regression models to assess associations between gender parity in industry and occupation and workplace sexual harassment. Findings: Our study of employed adults in the U.S. found that 42% women and 15% men had experienced workplace sexual harassment. Logistic regression analyses indicated that women employed in female-dominated industries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.33, 0.81]) and men employed in male-dominated occupations (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI = [0.33, 0.91]) were less likely to have experienced workplace sexual harassment.

Creating cultural shifts to prevent men's sexual harassment perpetration requires attention to community as well as individual factors. Study data were collected from a cohort of 768 youth and young adult males ages 10-18 at baseline (2013), with follow-up 3 years later. Multivariable regression was applied to assess the role of neighborhood characteristics, including crime rates, gender equality, and concentrated disadvantage, adjusting for individual sociodemographics and views on traditional gender stereotypes. The self-reported prevalence of sexual harassment perpetration was 8.8%. In neighborhoods characterized by greater concentrated disadvantage, the likelihood of male sexual harassment perpetration was significantly lower than in neighborhoods characterized by greater advantages. Relative neighborhood advantage was associated with sexual harassment perpetration even controlling for the significant positive association between espousing traditional gender stereotypes and perpetration of sexual harassment. The relative rates of neighborhood crime and gender equality did not predict young males' sexual harassment perpetration. In sum, young men's perpetration of sexual harassment behaviors is more common in more advantaged communities, underscoring the importance of awareness that, beyond individual attitudes, there is a collective social influence on individual behavior.",2020,Apr,J Community Health,45,2,245-251,,10.1007/s10900-019-00738-2,31502099,#151,Mumford 2020,"",""
A Needs-Based Support for #MeToo: Power and Morality Needs Shape Women's and Men's Support of the Campaign.,Kende A; Nyúl B; Lantos NA; Hadarics M; Petlitski D; Kehl J; Shnabel N,"The #MeToo campaign mobilized millions of women around the world to draw attention to the pervasiveness of sexual harassment. We conducted an online survey in Hungary (N = 10,293) immediately at the campaign's onset, and two subsequent studies in Israel and Germany (Ns = 356, 413) after it peaked, to reveal the motivations underlying people's support for, or criticism of the campaign. Integrating the assumptions of the needs-based model of reconciliation and system justification theory, we predicted and found that, in all three samples, lower gender system justification was associated with (a) women's perception of the campaign as empowering, and men's (b) higher perception of the campaign as an opportunity for moral improvement, and (c) lower perception of the campaign as wrongfully staining men's reputation. As expected, in all three samples, (a) perceptions of the campaign as empowering among women, and an opportunity for moral improvement among men, were associated with greater campaign support, whereas (b) men's perceptions of the campaign as wrongfully staining their moral reputation were associated with lower campaign support. Thus, the link between system justification and campaign support was mediated by women's empowerment needs, and men's morality-related needs. In addition, perceptions of the campaign as disempowering their ingroup (i.e., presenting a status threat) predicted reduced campaign support among men in the Hungarian and Israeli samples, but not the German sample. We discuss the practical implications of these results for gender equality movements in general, and sexual harassment in particular, by identifying the psychological obstacles and catalysts of women's and men's support for social change.",2020,,Front Psychol,11,,593,,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00593,32296377,#152,Kende 2020,"",""
Effects of sexual harassment on advancement of women in academic medicine: A multi-institutional longitudinal study.,Raj A; Freund KM; McDonald JM; Carr PL,"BACKGROUND: Sexual harassment of women in academic medicine may impede advancement and productivity. This study analyzes the longitudinal effects of sexual harassment on academic advancement and productivity among women. METHODS: We undertook a longitudinal analysis to predict effects of sexual harassment reported in 1995 on career outcomes measured in 2012-13, among a sample of women in academic medicine (N = 1273) recruited from 24 U.S. medical schools. Measures included survey data from 1995 on sexual harassment (predictor), and 2012-2013 data on retention in academic medicine, rank, leadership positions, and refereed publications (outcomes), captured from surveys and public records. We used multivariable models to test effects of sexual harassment on study outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographics, employment-related variables, and gender discrimination. FINDINGS: In 1995, 54% of women reported any workplace sexual harassment, and 32% of women reported severe harassment (e.g., threats or coercive sexual advances) in the workplace. Multivariable regression models showed no significant effects of sexual harassment. However, severe sexual harassment was associated with higher odds of attaining full professorship by 2012-2013 (AOR: 1·70; 95% CI 1·03, 2·80; p = 0·04). INTERPRETATION: Contrary to our hypothesis, women reporting severe workplace harassment in 1995 were more rather than less likely to advance to full professor. Women seeking advancement may be more vulnerable to sexual harassment in academic medicine vis a vis greater exposure to those who abuse their position of authority.

Giving Voice to Silence: Empowerment and Disempowerment in the Developmental Shift from Trauma 'Victim' to 'Survivor-Advocate'.,Delker BC; Salton R; McLean KC,"In the past several years, a public conversation in the United States about interpersonal violence has flourished, sustained by the work of advocates who are themselves survivors. This surge in public sharing of trauma stories is a rhetorical form of resistance to ideologies in mainstream American culture that impose silence on survivors (e.g., the ""just world"" belief). However, the developmental progression from trauma 'victim' to empowered public 'survivor/advocate' accommodates to dominant American cultural preferences that stories of adversity have a redemptive story line. In a redemptive story, negative experiences are followed by something positive (e.g., personal growth, lessons learned, strength gained). In this paper, we draw from theory and the sparse relevant literature across multiple disciplines to conceptualize when and for whom the redemptive storying of trauma (or, redemptive master narrative) is available, advantageous, and systemically encouraged. Among the proposed advantages of redemptive storying are its psychological health benefits; potential to empower self and others; promotion of meaning-making, mission, and communal solidarity; and the larger social/political changes that can emerge from giving voice to silenced experiences. Proposed challenges to redemptive storying include layers of societal oppression and marginalization that shape the redemption stories of many survivor-advocates; ongoing connection to or dependence on relationships and communities that enable abuse; and the reality of historical trauma and other forms of intergenerational trauma, which complicate the linear, individualistic story of redemption. With this theory-driven framework, we wish to promote compassion for survivors, along with interdisciplinary, inclusive, and intersectional research in this understudied area.",2020,Mar-Apr,J Trauma Dissociation,21,2,242-263,,10.1080/15299732.2019.1678212,31630664,#154,Delker 2020,"",""
#MeToo in EM: A Multicenter Survey of Academic Emergency Medicine Faculty on Their Experiences with Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment.,Lu DW; Lall MD; Mitzman J; Heron S; Pierce A; Hartman ND; McCarthy DM; Jauregui J; Strout TD,"INTRODUCTION: Gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment of female physicians are well documented. The #MeToo movement has brought renewed attention to these problems. This study examined academic emergency physicians' experiences with workplace gender discrimination and sexual harassment. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of emergency medicine (EM) faculty across six programs. Survey items included the following: the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work (OGDW) Scale; the frequency and source of experienced and observed discrimination; and whether subjects had encountered unwanted sexual behaviors by a work superior or colleague in their careers. For the latter question, we asked subjects to characterize the behaviors and whether those experiences had a negative effect on their self-confidence and career advancement. We made group comparisons using t-tests or chi-square analyses, and evaluated relationships between gender and physicians' experiences using correlation analyses. RESULTS: A total of 141 out of 352 (40.1%) subjects completed at least a portion of the survey. Women reported higher mean OGDW scores than men (15.4 vs 10.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-6.8). Female faculty were also more likely to report having experienced gender-based discriminatory treatment than male faculty (62.7% vs 12.5%; 95% CI, 35.1%-65.4%), although male and female faculty were equally likely to report having observed gender-based discriminatory treatment of another physician (64.7% vs 56.3%; 95% CI, 8.6%-25.5%). The three most frequent sources of experienced or observed gender-based discriminatory treatment were patients, consulting or admitting physicians, and nursing staff. The majority of women reported having encountered unwanted sexual behaviors in their careers, with a significantly greater proportion of women reporting them compared to men (52.9% vs 26.2%, 95% CI, 9.9%-43.4%). The majority of unwanted behaviors were sexist remarks and sexual advances. Of those respondents who encountered these unwanted behaviors, 22.9% and 12.5% reported at least somewhat negative effects on their self-confidence and career advancement.

Sex Differences in Problem Alcohol Use in High School as a Function of Recent Sexual Violence Victimization or Perpetration.,Badour CL; Bell SC; Clear ER; Bush HM; Coker AL,"To investigate sex differences in associations between sexual violence victimization (SVV), sexual violence perpetration (SVP), and binge drinking and/or alcohol problems among high school students. While SVV has been linked to problem alcohol use among young women, little research has addressed the unique associations of SVV and SVP on alcohol use/problems within both sexes. A cross-sectional analysis of 16,992 high school students' self-reports of past-year SVP and SVV was used where SVV/SVP was defined by three tactics (sexual coercion, drug/alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated sex, and physically forced sex). Alcohol measures included past-month binge drinking and past-year alcohol problems. Rates of SVV were twice as high in females (21.2% vs. 13.3%), and SVP rates were twice as high in males (10.9% vs. 5.2%). SVV and SVP were each associated with an increased rate of current binge drinking and problem alcohol use for both sexes, across increasing numbers of SV tactics and within each of three tactics. After controlling for demographic and other risk factors including SVP, drug/alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated SVV was more strongly linked to binge drinking and alcohol problems among females. SVP was more strongly linked to binge drinking and alcohol problems among males (adjusting for SVV and other covariates). No sex differences emerged in associations between coerced or physically forced SVV/SVP and alcohol-related outcomes.

The Association Between Gender Inequality and Sexual Violence in the U.S.,Kearns MC; D'Inverno AS; Reidy DE,"INTRODUCTION: Few societal-level factors are established as risk or protective factors for sexual violence. Traditional gender norms and gender inequality are linked to sexual violence, but much of this research was conducted internationally or is becoming outdated and may not reflect current norms in the U.S. This study expands on previously published research by examining gender inequality's association with state-level sexual violence. METHODS: Using state-level prevalence estimates published in the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012 State Report and the Gender Inequality Index, Pearson correlations were examined to investigate the relationship between state-level gender inequality and lifetime victimization for various types of sexual violence among U.S. female and male adults. The analysis was conducted in 2019. RESULTS: Findings indicate that states with a high degree of gender inequality also report higher prevalence estimates among women for rape using physical force. Gender inequality was also negatively correlated with noncontact unwanted sexual experiences among women and men. In addition, an exploratory analysis of the relationship between individual indicators of gender inequality and violence outcomes suggest that the adolescent birth rate, female government representation, and labor force participation demonstrate an association with certain state-level violence outcomes, although the patterns were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study relied on cross-sectional data, collectively, these findings suggest that gender inequality may represent an important societal-level factor associated with sexual violence among women and men. However, this relationship appears complex and requires further research. These findings have potential to inform population-level violence prevention approaches.",2020,Jan,Am J Prev Med,58,1,12-20,,10.1016/j.amepre.2019.08.035,31761512,#158,Kearns 2020,"",""
Prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador using the ICAST-R.,Jiménez-Borja M; Jiménez-Borja V; Borja-Alvarez T; Jiménez-Mosquera CAJ; Murgueitio J,"OBJECTIVES: While the link between childhood experiences of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and mental health problems has been largely studied, there is limited information regarding the prevalence of child maltreatment in developing countries, particularly in South America. The present study is an effort to investigate the prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador using the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool Retrospective version (ICAST-R). METHOD: A student sample (males = 1579; females = 1554) from the seven largest universities in Quito, Ecuador, completed the ICAST-R. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 69.6 % of participants experienced child maltreatment. Physical abuse was reported by 47.6 % of respondents; this commonly involved being beaten by parents. Emotional maltreatment was reported by 53 % of the participants; mostly through insults by same-sex peers and parents. Sexual abuse was reported by 15.5 % of the participants. The most prevalent forms of sexual abuse included being coerced into touching another person's genitals, having their genitals touched by others, or having someone expose their genitals to them. Sexual abuse was more prevalent amongst females (males = 12.9 %; females = 18.1 %, OR = 1.49; CI = 1.22-1.81), and physical abuse was more prevalent amongst males (males = 50.5 %; females = 44.6 %, OR = 0.79; CI = 0.69-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows evidence of a high prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador. We also identify significant gender differences in the type of abuse experienced, and in the context in which this abuse takes place.

Two studies examined the association between sexual objectification and sexual satisfaction for both views: female target (Study 1) and male perpetrator (Study 2) perspectives. The results of the first study (n = 138 heterosexual women) demonstrated that perceiving partner objectification (but not reporting general sexual objectification victimization) is indirectly linked to a lower sexual satisfaction because of lower rejection and higher sexual coercion rates. The second study (n = 136 heterosexual men) showed the indirect effect of partner objectification and general sexual objectification perpetration on sexual satisfaction after sexual coercion perpetration. Results of both studies demonstrated the negative consequences that sexual objectification has on sexual satisfaction for both male perpetrators and female targets.,2019,,Front Psychol,10,,2748,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02748,31920805,#160,Sáez 2019,"",""
"Family, School, and Peer Support Are Associated With Rates of Violence Victimization and Self-Harm Among Gender Minority and Cisgender Youth.",Ross-Reed DE; Reno J; Peñaloza L; Green D; FitzGerald C,"PURPOSE: Gender minority (GM) youth experience high rates of violence, and research on protective factors to reduce violence victimization and self-harm is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine how family, school, peer, and community support influenced rates of violence victimization and self-harm among GM and cisgender adolescents. METHODS: This research uses data from the 2017 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (N = 18,451). The main independent variable was gender, dichotomized into GM and cisgender, and the secondary independent variables were family, school, community, and peer support. Dependent variables were sexual and dating violence, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury. Logistic regression models were built for the four dependent variables, including demographics, support scores, and interaction terms between gender and support. RESULTS: Six percent of high school students in New Mexico identified as GM are unsure of their gender. GM students experienced higher rates of violence and self-harm and lower levels of support than cisgender students. Among all students, family support was associated with lower odds of sexual violence and self-harm, while school support was associated with lower odds of dating violence and nonsuicidal self-injury. There were significant interactions between gender, violence, and support. The protective effects of support were less pronounced for GM students than for cisgender students.

[Sexual violence against women in Tunisia].,Fekih-Romdhane F; Ridha R; Cheour M,"BACKGROUND: Sexual violence exists everywhere in the world. It depends mainly on the cultural and religious norms conveyed in the various societies. This is a neglected area of research. Available data are insufficient, especially in Arab-Muslim context. METHODS: In this paper, we comprehensively review the scientific literature in order to clarify the cultural, religious and legal aspects of the concept of sexual violence against women in Tunisia, and ask the question of the urgent need to put in place strategies to counter this problem. RESULTS: The National Office for Family and Population published in 2011 the results of the national survey on violence against women in Tunisia, including data on sexual violence and its impact on women's health and well-being. According to this survey, 14.2% of women reported having been sexually abused by an intimate partner during their lifetime and 9.0% reported having experienced it during the last 12 months. One out of every six Tunisian women has been the victim of a sexual violence in a conjugal setting. More men than women legitimized violence against women in contexts where family control, especially conjugal control, is exercised over them. In a study examining the impact of culture and religion on experiences and sexual practice of women in Tunisian society, the majority of respondents thought that sexuality in women was a religious duty and that they do not have the right to refuse their husbands or to rebel. Thus, women would be doubly sanctioned having neither the right to express their desire nor not to respond to their husband's desire. A survey of a representative sample of Tunisian women found that 56.9% of the participants reported being victims of domestic violence, particularly sexual violence (10.7%) consisting mainly of rape and sodomy, at least once in their lifetime. This survey showed that those victims expressed dissatisfaction with overall quality of life. Moreover, contrary to Western literature, sexual violence was the least reported form of violence by teenage girls in Tunisian schools. Indeed, cultural values of modesty, virginity and honor are socially much more demanded for girls, in Arab countries in general, reinforcing staggering silence and inaction around violence experienced by school-aged adolescents. In Tunisian society, the cultural ""solution"" to rape wants the woman to marry her rapist which safeguards her family's integrity by legitimizing the union. CONCLUSION: Sexual violence has detrimental effects on female victims' physical and mental health. Even if the information on this form of violence is not easy to obtain in our environment, and that rates of subjects reporting sexual violence in their lifetimes are not important, the problem of sexual violence must be considered as a public health problem requiring urgent interventions and a greater institutional will.",2019,Dec,Encephale,45,6,527-529,,10.1016/j.encep.2018.07.004,30301569,#162,Fekih-Romdhane 2019,"",""
"""You Do Not Think of Me as a Human Being"": Race and Gender Inequities Intersect to Discourage Police Reporting of Violence against Women.",Decker MR; Holliday CN; Hameeduddin Z; Shah R; Miller J; Dantzler J; Goodmark L,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) are drivers of women's morbidity and mortality in urban environments yet remain among the most underreported crimes in the USA. We conducted 26 in-depth interviews with women who experienced past-year IPV or SV, to explore structural and community influences on police contact in Baltimore, MD. Results indicate that gender-based and race-based inequities intersected at the structural and community levels to discourage women from police contact following IPV/SV. Structural influences on police reporting included police discriminatory police misconduct, perceived lack of concern for citizens, power disparities, fear of harm from police, and IPV/SV-related minimization and victim-blaming. Community social norms of police avoidance discouraged police contact, enforced by stringent sanctions. The intersectional lens contextualizes a unique paradox for Black women: the fear of unjust harm to their partners through an overzealous and racially motivated police response and the simultaneous sense of futility in a justice system that may not sufficiently prioritize IPV/SV. This study draws attention to structural race and gender inequities in the urban public safety environment that shape IPV/SV outcomes. Race-based inequity undermines women's safety and access to justice and pits women's safety against community priorities of averting police contact and disproportionate incarceration. A social determinants framework is valuable for understanding access to justice for IPV/SV.

In a large population-based Finnish sample (N = 13,024), we retrospectively measured multiple experiences of child victimization and, in a subsample of twins (n = 9,562), we estimated the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influenced these experiences. In particular, we investigated whether genetic and environmental influences varied depending on the type of child victimization, the genetic relatedness with the perpetrator, and the sex of the victim. Our quantitative genetic analyses supported the presence of both genetic and environmental influences on the occurrence and co-occurrence of child abuse and neglect. We also identified one common etiological pathway underlying multiple child victimizations, and after accounting for this common etiology, we singled out risk factors specific to sexual abuse. Environmental factors shared and nonshared between twins raised together influenced the risk of victimization by genetically related and unrelated perpetrators, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated sex differences in the etiology of emotional and sexual victimization, including larger unshared environmental influences for men and sex-limited genetic effects for women. These findings can inform child protection as they contribute to explaining why certain individuals are at increased risk of experiencing one or more types of child maltreatment.",2019,,Front Genet,10,,852,,10.3389/fgene.2019.00852,31608106,#164,Pezzoli 2019,"",""

Gender and Race Informed Pathways From Childhood Sexual Abuse to Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Moderated Mediation Analysis Using Nationally Representative Data.,Fix RL; Assini-Meytin LC; Le PD,"PURPOSE: Although data suggest child sexual abuse is linked with increased risk of contracting asexually transmitted infection (STI), the mechanisms through which these experiences are connected remain understudied. Moreover, there is a need to explore how race/ethnicity and gender influence these processes. METHODS: The present study examined the mediational pathways from child sexual abuse to risky sexual behavior to STIs and further evaluated the role of depressive symptomatology and nonmedical prescription drug use on the relationship between child sexual abuse and risky sexual behavior. In addition, race and gender were examined as moderators to account for potential different effects of these mechanisms on females and males and on different racial and ethnic groups. A nationally representative sample of 4,181 youth from the Add Health dataset was used. RESULTS: Results from a moderated mediation model indicated risky sexual behavior partially mediated the pathway from child sexual abuse to STI contraction and depressive symptomatology and nonmedical prescription drug use partially mediated pathway from child sexual abuse to risky sexual behavior. Race and gender moderated the relationship between risky sexual behavior and STI contraction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the need for STI prevention efforts among adolescents to focus on risk factors beyond risky sexual behaviors, such as childhood sexual abuse and mental health screening that includes depressive symptomatology and nonmedical prescription drug use.

Effectiveness of the three-session (two male-only sessions and one couple session) Counseling Husbands to Achieve Reproductive Health and Marital Equity (CHARM) intervention, which used male health providers to engage and counsel husbands on gender equity and family planning (GE + FP), was demonstrated by increased pill and condom use and a reduction in MSV. However, the intervention had limited reach to women and was therefore unable to expand access to highly effective long acting reversible contraceptives such as the intrauterine device (IUD). We developed a second iteration of the intervention, CHARM2, which retains the three sessions from the original CHARM but adds female provider- delivered counseling to women and offers a broader array of contraceptives including IUDs. This protocol describes the evaluation of CHARM2 in rural Maharashtra. METHODS: A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate CHARM2, a gender synchronized GE + FP intervention. Eligible married couples (n = 1200) will be enrolled across 20 clusters in rural Maharashtra, India. Health providers will be gender-matched to deliver two GE + FP sessions to the married couples in parallel, and then a final session will be delivered to the couple together. We will conduct surveys on demographics as well as GE and FP indicators at baseline, 9-month, and 18-month follow-ups with both men and women, and pregnancy tests at each time point from women. In-depth interviews will be conducted with a subsample of couples (n = 50) and providers (n = 20). We will conduct several implementation and monitoring activities for purposes of assuring fidelity to intervention design and quality of implementation, including recruitment and tracking logs, provider evaluation forms, session observation forms, and participant satisfaction surveys. DISCUSSION: We will complete the recruitment of participants and collection of baseline data by July 2019.

The Impact of Leadership Responses to Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination Reports on Emotional Distress and Retention Intentions in Military Members.,Daniel S; Neria A; Moore A; Davis E,"Reporting instances of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the workplace is an integral part of the prevention and response efforts of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Any military member who comes forward to report their experience should be provided appropriate intervention, support, and restorative care. While much research has focused on prevention efforts and encouraging reporting, few researchers have systematically examined what happens when military members come forward. In the military, leaders (the chain of command) are primarily responsible for receiving and investigating reports of potential sex-based military equal opportunity violations (SBMEO) involving sexual harassment or gender discrimination. This study used results from the congressionally-mandated 2016 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members (2016 WGRA) to identify military members who indicated experiencing a potential SBMEO violation and reported to their chain of command (n = 3,982) in order to examine the relationships among the actions as a result of reporting, reporting satisfaction, emotional distress, and retention intentions. Findings revealed experiencing positive actions as a result of reporting was associated with increased satisfaction with reporting, which in turn, was associated with decreased emotional distress and increased retention intentions. Conversely, experiencing negative actions as a result of reporting was associated with decreased satisfaction with reporting, increased emotional distress, and decreased retention intentions. These findings highlight the crucial role military leaders serve in supporting those who come forward in mitigating potential negative outcomes associated with SBMEO violations that could impact military readiness.",2019,May-Jun,J Trauma Dissociation,20,3,357-372,,10.1080/15299732.2019.1571887,30784361,#169,Daniel 2019,"",""
Mental distress and sexual harassment in Italian university students.,Bastiani F; Romito P; Saurel-Cubizolles MJ,"Only a few studies have analyzed the association between sexual harassment (SH) and mental health controlling for other types of violence. The aim of this study was to describe SH among male and female university students and analyze the association between harassment and mental distress controlling for sexual violence. An observational survey was conducted at Trieste University (Italy). Students answered an anonymous questionnaire about harassment that included three domains-sexual harassment, gender harassment, cyber harassment-and three psychological health indicators. The global harassment index was computed, with three levels: 0, no harassment; level 1, harassment in at least one of the three domains; and level 2, harassment in two or three domains. The symptoms of mental distress were measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) for depressive symptoms; a question about panic symptoms; and a question about general health. The sample included 759 students (412 women; 18 to 29 years old). After adjustment for age, birth country, couple relationship, employment status, mother's education, and previous sexual violence, the risk of mental distress was increased with harassment exposure. Men were affected in perceived health and depressive symptoms (GHQ score ≥ 6); women were affected in panic symptoms.

In four experiments, we systematically varied perpetrators' sex and victims' sex. In three investigations, we assessed personality variables potentially related to participants' use of these social categories. Across these four experiments, we varied perpetrator-victim relationships (teacher-student, neighbors) and victims' ages. In experiment one, individuals had the least negative attitude about child sexual abuse involving adult female neighbors and eighth grade male neighbors. In experiment two, we replicated this effect with fifth grade victims and demonstrated that attitudes were moderated by individual differences in intolerance of ambiguity. In experiment three, we again replicated the aforementioned effect while (a) extending this finding to teacher-student relationships with eighth grade adolescent victims and (b) demonstrating the need for cognition was a moderator. In experiment four, we again replicated (a) our perpetrator sex/victim sex interactive effect and (b) need for cognition moderation while also demonstrating that these effects were applicable to fifth grade victims.

Communities' perceptions of factors contributing to child sexual abuse vulnerability in Kenya: a qualitative study.,Wangamati CK; Sundby J; Prince RJ,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major global health concern. Although it is prevalent in Kenya, scant literature on factors contributing to CSA vulnerability exists. Using qualitative data from 28 focus groups and ethnographic field notes, we explored and assessed community perceptions of factors contributing to CSA vulnerability in Homa Bay County, Western Kenya. Findings suggest that people living in these communities perceived CSA as being influenced by multiple factors: developmental stage, peer pressure, huge gender disparities exacerbated by negative social norms and cultural practices, the HIV epidemic and social media platforms that circulate sexualised images. From our findings, it was clear that participants also regarded poverty as exacerbating children's vulnerability to CSA. Minors from poor families engaged in transactional sex for survival and social status. Some community members perceived girls dressed in short skirts or tight clothing as warranting unwanted sexual advances. Although poverty and gender roles and relations were viewed as increasing vulnerability to CSA, blame was often placed on survivors' modes of dress or behaviour.

Moreover, it jointly analyzed the predictive power of different variables that have been considered as useful to design preventive programs. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study, using proportional stratified cluster sampling, was performed and 1,242 Spanish adolescents (15-19 years old) were surveyed. Results show that both genders had reported committing and suffering sexual coercion. However, perpetration was reported more often by males: no significant gender difference was found in victimization. It was also concluded that need for control and power, normative beliefs about sexual coercion, hostile sexism, negative alcohol expectancies, and sociosexual orientation were significant predictors of perpetration for both genders. Concerning victimization, need for control and power and normative beliefs were found to be significant predictors for males and females, as were negative alcohol expectancies and sexual esteem, though only for males. According to these results, both genders can be both perpetrators and victims of sexual coercion in adolescence, but not to the same extent.

Exploring Gender and Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Effects of Child Sexual Abuse.,Gray S; Rarick S,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) has been linked to a number of adverse effects including hypersexuality (HYP), substance use (SUB), suicidality (SUI), and depression (DEP). Despite a plethora of research on CSA, little is known about how it affects adolescents and the cultural factors that influence their coping styles. This study was founded on social-cultural coping theory and the model of traumagenic dynamics of sexual abuse, suggesting that CSA consequences lead to maladaptive coping mechanisms influenced by sociocultural factors. Using archival data, loglinear analysis was conducted to examine gender differences within racial/ethnic groups in HYP, SUI, DEP, and SUB among adolescent survivors of CSA in a National sample of 13,583 male and female high school students. The purpose of the study was to identify differences in the effects of CSA as manifested by variations of maladaptive coping across racial/ethnic groups and gender. Boys were significantly more likely to use substances, while girls were more likely to experience depressive symptoms and suicidality. Notably, this study did not reveal any significant racial/ethnic differences in adolescent coping. These findings can inform treatment planning and interventions for adolescents who may present with DEP, SUI, SUB, or risky sexual behaviors, but may have underlying trauma from CSA.

The goals of the current study were (1) to identify vulnerability among sexual and gender minority students with regard to sexual violence, and (2) to explore if the context of this violence differs across sexual and gender minority status. METHODS: Undergraduate students (ages 18-24) from six francophone universities in Quebec, Canada (N = 4,264) completed online questionnaires regarding their experience of sexual violence, as well as the context of these acts (e.g., the gender of the perpetrator, the status of the perpetrator, and the location of the violence). They also provided information regarding their sexual and gender minority status. Binary logistic regressions were conducted to assess for variation in experiencing sexual violence across sexual and gender minority status. RESULTS: Transgender/nonbinary students generally reported higher levels of sexual violence than their cisgender peers, while variation occurred with regard to vulnerability across sexual identity subgroups. Few differences in context were observed across sexual minority identity. Transgender/nonbinary students were significantly more likely to report sexual violence in athletic contexts and during volunteering activities compared to their cisgender peers.

AIM: The purpose of our study is to describe the medical and legal characteristics of children who experience sexual abuse and explore common features that may result in strategies for prevention. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2015, 400 girls and 26 boys under the age of 18, suspected of being sexually abused, visited one of the four hospitals in a Hungarian county. RESULTS: Mean age at onset was 10.81 years for boys, 13.46 years for girls. In 278 cases (65.3%), the perpetrator was known to the victim, and a stranger was suspected in 148 cases (34.7%). In 79 cases (30.7% of boys and 17.7% of girls), a family member was the accused perpetrator. In more than one-third (boys) and in one-fifth (girls) of cases, sexual abuse had occurred on multiple occasions.

We compared female-accused cases against a randomly selected sample of 70 male-accused cases from the same database. We investigated associations between gender of the accused and characteristics of the victim, offense, and criminal proceeding. Several important differences between female- and male-accused cases were found: proportionally more male complainants were in female-accused cases; female-accused offenses were longer in duration; and despite offenses being similarly intrusive, female perpetrators received shorter sentences.

The sample comprised 1940 sexually active adolescents (M(age)=15.6; 60.8% girls) attending Quebec (Canada) high schools. Regression results showed that all maltreatment forms were associated with having a higher number of sexual partners, casual sexual behavior, and a younger age at first consensual intercourse. Physical abuse and witnessing interparental violence were associated with inconsistent condom use, and physical abuse was associated with sexually transmitted infections. After controlling for all forms of maltreatment (unique effects), analyses showed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect or witnessing interparental violence remained statistically associated depending on the sexual risk behavior. A greater number of forms of maltreatment was associated with more sexual risk behaviors (cumulative effect). When sexual abuse was not experienced, neglect was associated with a higher number of sexual partners (interactive effects). In general, associations between maltreatment and sexual risk behaviors were similar for both genders.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study recent incidents of physical and sexual assault were examined with the Safety Monitor in 243 patients with dual diagnosis. Chi-square tests were used to examine gender differences in the prevalence of physical and sexual victimization. Fisher's exact tests and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine whether there were significant differences between victimized men and women with regard to perpetrators, locations, reporting to the police and speaking about the assault with others. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of physical violence in men (35%) and women (47%) with dual diagnosis. There was a significant association between gender of the victim and type of perpetrator (P < .001). Men were most often physically abused by a stranger or an acquaintance, whereas women were most frequently abused by an (ex)partner. Sexual violence was more prevalent in women (29%) compared to men (4%) (P < .001). Patients with dual diagnosis were unlikely to report incidents of physical abuse and sexual assault to the police and to speak about it with caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of physical violence are different for men and women with dual diagnosis. Women with dual diagnosis are more often victims of sexual violence compared to men. Interventions aimed at reducing patients' vulnerability for victimization should take gender differences into account.",2017,Jul,BMC Psychiatry,17,1,270,,10.1186/s12888-017-1413-0,28743237,#191,deWaal 2017,"",""

Physical and mental health of children with substantiated sexual abuse: Gender comparisons from a matched-control cohort study.,Daigneault I; Vézina-Gagnon P; Bourgeois C; Esposito T; Hébert M,"When compared to children from the general population, sexually abused children receive more medical services, both for physical and mental health problems.

The objective of the study was to assess differences in physical and mental health between sexually abused boys and girls in comparison to those from the general population. Administrative databases were used to document physical and mental health problems of 222 males and 660 females with a substantiated report of sexual abuse between 2001 and 2010. A comparison group individually matched to those from the sexually abused group on gender, age and geographic area was also used to document gender differences in the general population. Yearly incidence rates of diagnoses resulting from medical consultations and hospitalizations of males and females were compared over five years after a first substantiated sexual abuse report using the mixed general linear model. Sexually abused girls were up to 2.2 times more likely to consult a physician than sexually abused boys for physical health problems. Similar findings are observed in the general population.

Gender as a predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms and externalizing behavior problems in sexually abused children.,Gauthier-Duchesne A; Hébert M; Daspe MÈ,"Despite the proliferation of studies documenting outcomes in sexually abused victims, gender differences remain understudied. The bulk of studies have relied on retrospective samples of adults with insufficient representation of male victims to explore gender specificities. This study examined differential outcomes among boy and girl victims of sexual abuse. A predictive model of outcomes including abuse characteristics and sense of guilt as mediators was proposed. Path analysis was conducted with a sample of 447 sexually abused children (319 girls and 128 boys), aged 6-12. Being a girl was a predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms, while being a boy was a predictor of externalizing problems. Being a boy was also associated with more severe abuse, which in turn predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms. Child's gender was not related to perpetrator's relationship to the child or sense of guilt. However, sense of guilt predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms and externalizing problems while perpetrator's relationship to the child predicted externalizing problems. Gender specificities should be further studied among sexually abused children, as boys and girls appear to manifest different outcomes.

"Cultural practices, gender inequality and inconsistent condom use increase vulnerability to HIV infection: narratives from married and cohabiting women in rural communities in Mpumalanga province, South Africa.",Madiba S; Ngwenya N,"BACKGROUND: Women in sub-Saharan Africa bear the brunt of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, and older married women and those in cohabiting relationships are regarded as the largest HIV risk group. Although preventing HIV infection in married or stable relationships is an international HIV prevention priority, little is known about the influence of sociocultural contexts on safe-sex practice by women, particularly older women in rural communities in South Africa. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine how older women in a rural patriarchal society negotiate safer sex within marital and long-term cohabitation relationships, and their perceptions and experiences of barriers that influence condom use. METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted with married and cohabiting women aged 40-60 years recruited from primary health facilities in a rural district in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: We found that although women reported negotiating safe sex in their relationships, they dreaded the possible consequences of suggesting condom use with their partners. Many factors made negotiating safe sex complex for these women: living in a patriarchal society where women play no part in sexual decision making, the fear of possible consequences of insisting on condom use, women's inferior social position in marital relationships, cultural practices such as bride price, and gender inequality were the main barriers to practising safer sex. CONCLUSIONS: Older married and cohabiting women dreaded negotiating safer sex in this patriarchal society where women's subordination is legitimized. The findings suggest that the women were at high risk of HIV infection because of their inability to negotiate condom use, or to reject forced sex and non-consensual sex. There is a need for interventions targeting older married and cohabiting couples and key stakeholders within communities to create awareness about cultural practices and beliefs that undermine women and HIV prevention efforts.",2017,Jan-Dec,Glob Health Action,10,sup2,1341597,,10.1080/16549716.2017.1341597,28678650,#196,Madiba 2017,"",""

Odds were adjusted by indicators of mental health to assess if these variables mediated associations between CSA and substance abuse. Tests of interactions between sex and CSA were conducted to see if gender differences exist in associations. In 2004/2005, CSA was reported by 14% of women and 5% of men. CSA was associated with heavy drinking, hazardous drinking, and the use of marijuana, other illicit drugs, and off-label drugs.

Unwanted sexual attention at work and long-term sickness absence: a follow-up register-based study.,Hogh A; Conway PM; Clausen T; Madsen IE; Burr H,"BACKGROUND: The current understanding of the relationship between unwanted sexual attention at work and long-term sickness absence (LTSA) is limited for three reasons: 1) the under-researched role of unwanted sexual attention perpetrated by individuals outside the work organization; 2) a widespread use of self-reported measures of sickness absence, with an unclear identification of sickness absence episodes of long duration; 3) the cross-sectional design of most existing studies. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the relationship between self-reported unwanted sexual attention at work and subsequent LTSA (≥3 weeks), stratifying by gender and source of exposure (i.e., colleagues, managers and/or subordinates vs. clients/customers/patients). METHODS: This prospective study is based on a pooled sample of 14,605 employees from three Danish surveys conducted in 2000, 2004 and 2005, providing a total of 19,366 observations. A single questionnaire-based item was used to assess exposure to unwanted sexual attention. The pooled dataset was merged with Danish register data on LTSA. The risk of first-onset episode of LTSA (up to 18 months after baseline) in connection with unwanted sexual attention was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. We estimated Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) adjusted for age, influence at work, work pace, occupational group and mode of data collection. We also adjusted for repeated measures from individual respondents by stratifying the Cox models by wave of survey. RESULTS: Unwanted sexual attention from colleagues, managers and/or subordinates predicted LTSA among men (HR 2.66; 95 % CI 1.42-5.00). Among women, an elevated but non-statistically significant risk of LTSA (HR 1.18; 95 % CI 0.65-2.14) was found. Unwanted sexual attention from clients/customers/patients did not predict LTSA, neither among men nor among women. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a significantly elevated risk of LTSA, among men only, in relation to exposure to unwanted sexual attention from colleagues, managers and/or subordinates. This study therefore suggests both individual and organizational costs associated with unwanted sexual attention at work. Due to the low prevalence of unwanted sexual attention, larger studies with more statistical power are needed to confirm (or disconfirm) the present findings.",2016,Jul,BMC Public Health,16,,678,,10.1186/s12889-016-3336-y,27475538,#199,Hogh 2016,"",""
How the Interaction of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Gender Relates to HIV Risk Practices among Urban-Dwelling African Americans.,Klein H; Elifson KW; Sterk CE,"PURPOSE: Previous research has demonstrated that HIV risk practices often differ based on gender and on whether or not people experienced sexual abuse during their formative (i.e., childhood and adolescence) years. The interaction of these two factors, which is the focus of this paper, has received limited attention. METHODS: Based on a model derived from Social Disorganization Theory and Syndemics Theory, interviews were conducted between 2009 and 2012 with 1,864 African American adults residing in Atlanta, Georgia in 80 strategically-chosen consensus block groups. RESULTS: Based on multiple regression and structural equation analyses, the interaction of sexual abuse and gender was found to be a significant predictor of involvement in (un)protected sex. The interaction of sexual abuse and gender also was related to condom use self-efficacy, which was one of the strongest factors underlying (un)protected sex. CONCLUSION: The relationship of sexual abuse history and gender is relevant in the understanding of HIV risk practices. The interaction of these factors with one another and with other relevant influences that shape people's HIV risk profiles is complex. The Syndemics Theory approach used to conceptualize the relationships among relevant variables in this study is an effective way of trying to understand and address HIV risk practices.",2016,Jul,J AIDS HIV Infect,2,1,,,10.15744/2454-499X.2.105,30197963,#200,Klein 2016,"",""
Bridging the gaps: a global review of intersections of violence against women and violence against children.,Guedes A; Bott S; Garcia-Moreno C; Colombini M,"BACKGROUND: The international community recognises violence against women (VAW) and violence against children (VAC) as global human rights and public health problems. Historically, research, programmes, and policies on these forms of violence followed parallel but distinct trajectories. Some have called for efforts to bridge these gaps, based in part on evidence that individuals and families often experience multiple forms of violence that may be difficult to address in isolation, and that violence in childhood elevates the risk of violence against women. METHODS: This article presents a narrative review of evidence on intersections between VAC and VAW - including sexual violence by non-partners, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. RESULTS: We identify and review evidence for six intersections: 1) VAC and VAW have many shared risk factors. 2) Social norms often support VAW and VAC and discourage help-seeking. 3) Child maltreatment and partner violence often co-occur within the same household. 4) Both VAC and VAW can produce intergenerational effects. 5) Many forms of VAC and VAW have common and compounding consequences across the lifespan. 6) VAC and VAW intersect during adolescence, a time of heightened vulnerability to certain kinds of violence. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of common correlates suggests that consolidating efforts to address shared risk factors may help prevent both forms of violence. Common consequences and intergenerational effects suggest a need for more integrated early intervention. Adolescence falls between and within traditional domains of both fields and deserves greater attention. Opportunities for greater collaboration include preparing service providers to address multiple forms of violence, better coordination between services for women and for children, school-based strategies, parenting programmes, and programming for adolescent health and development. There is also a need for more coordination among researchers working on VAC and VAW as countries prepare to measure progress towards 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.",2016,,Glob Health Action,9,,31516,,10.3402/gha.v9.31516,27329936,#201,Guedes 2016,"",""

Depressive symptoms were stable over time in both genders. Sexual name-calling was the dimension that had the strongest associations to all dimensions of depressive symptoms irrespective of gender. In girls, name-calling was associated with later somatic symptoms and negative affect, while anhedonia (reduced ability to experience pleasure) preceded later name-calling. Physical sexual harassment had a reciprocal relationship to somatic symptoms in girls. In boys, name-calling was preceded by all dimensions of depressive symptoms.

Integration of gender-transformative interventions into health professional education reform for the 21st century: implications of an expert review.,Newman C; Ng C; Pacqué-Margolis S; Frymus D,"BACKGROUND: Gender discrimination and inequality in health professional education (HPE) affect students and faculty and hinder production of the robust health workforces needed to meet health and development goals, yet HPE reformers pay scant attention to these gender barriers. Gender equality must be a core value and professional practice competency for all actors in HPE and health employment systems. METHODS: Peer-review and non-peer-review literature previously identified in a review of the literature identified interventions to counter gender discrimination and inequality in HPE and tertiary education systems in North America and the Caribbean; West, East, and Southern Africa; Asia; the Middle East and North Africa; Europe; Australia; and South America. An assessment considered 51 interventions addressing sexual harassment (18), caregiver discrimination (27), and gender equality (6). Reviewers with expertise in gender and health system strengthening rated and ranked interventions according to six gender-transformative criteria. RESULTS: Thirteen interventions were considered to have transformational potential to address gender-related obstacles to entry, retention, career progression, and graduation in HPE, when implemented in core sets of interventions. The review identified one set with potential to counter sexual harassment in HPE and two sets to counter caregiver discrimination. Gender centers and equal employment opportunity units are structural interventions that can address multiple forms of gender discrimination and inequality. CONCLUSIONS: The paper's broad aim is to encourage HPE leaders to make gender-transformative reforms in the current way of doing business and commit to themselves to countering gender discrimination and inequality. Interventions to counter gender discrimination should be seen as integral parts of institutional and instructional reforms and essential investments to scale up quality HPE and recruit and retain health workers in the systems that educate and employ them.

First, we document each type of sexism and examine children's awareness and perceptions of that bias, including their own self-reports and attributions. We examine the implications of this sexism for children and adolescents' developmental health (i.e., social, academic, and psychological well-being).

This study aimed to investigate the relationships between childhood sexual and physical abuse and adult psychosis, and gender differences in levels of perceived social support. METHODS: A sample of 202 individuals presenting for the first time to mental health services with psychosis and 266 population-based controls from south-east London and Nottingham, UK, was utilised. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire was used to elicit retrospective reports of exposure to childhood adversity, and the Significant Others Questionnaire was completed to collect information on the current size of social networks and perceptions of emotional and practical support. RESULTS: There was evidence of an interaction between severe physical abuse and levels of support (namely, number of significant others; likelihood ratio test χ(2) = 3.90, p = 0.048). When stratified by gender, there were no clear associations between childhood physical or sexual abuse, current social support and odds of psychosis in men.

Evaluation of sex differences in health-related quality of life outcomes associated with child abuse: Results from the Ontario Child Health Study.,Tanaka M; Afifi TO; Wathen CN; Boyle MH; MacMillan HL,"AIMS: Despite the advances in child maltreatment research, there is still the need for comprehensive information about how abuse affects a broad range of categories of young adult functioning, and the extent to which these vary by sex. We examined the associations between child physical abuse (PA) and sexual abuse (SA) and six areas of functioning (mental health, physical health, life satisfaction, illegal substance use, alcohol problems and daily smoking). METHODS: Data were obtained from the 1983 Ontario Child Health Study and follow-up in 2000/2001 (n = 1893). Multilevel regression estimated the adjusted associations for PA (with severity) and SA with each of the outcomes. Estimates with an entire sample were presented with sex-by-abuse interactions to examine sex differences and then presented separately by sex. RESULTS: In the adjusted model, severe PA and SA were associated with impairment in mental health, and both forms of PA (severe and non-severe) and SA were associated with low life satisfaction. In addition, severe PA was associated with illegal substance use. Child abuse variables were not associated with poor physical health, alcohol problems or smoking. Although sex-stratified analyses revealed different patterns, there was no significant sex difference in the integrated sample.

Differences Between African-American and European-American Women in the Association of Childhood Sexual Abuse With Initiation of Marijuana Use and Progression to Problem Use.,Sartor CE; Agrawal A; Grant JD; Duncan AE; Madden PA; Lynskey MT; Heath AC; Bucholz KK,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is associated with elevated risk of early marijuana use and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Both the prevalence of CSA and the course of marijuana use differ between African Americans and European Americans. The current study aimed to determine whether these differences manifest in racial/ ethnic distinctions in the association of CSA with early and problem use of marijuana. METHOD: Data were derived from female participants in a female twin study and a high-risk family study of substance use (n = 4,193, 21% African-American). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses using CSA to predict initiation of marijuana use and progression to CUD symptom(s) were conducted separately by race/ethnicity. Sibling status on the marijuana outcome was used to adjust for familial influences. RESULTS: CSA was associated with both stages of marijuana use in African-American and European-American women. The association was consistent over the risk period (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.37, 1.79] for initiation; HR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.21, 1.88] for CUD symptom onset) in European-American women. In African-American women, the HRs for initiation were 2.52 (95% CI [1.52, 4.18]) before age 15, 1.82 (95% CI [1.36, 2.44]) at ages 15-17, and nonsignificant after age 17. In the CUD symptom model, CSA predicted onset only at age 21 and older (HR = 2.17, 95% CI [1.31, 3.59]). CONCLUSIONS: The association of CSA with initiation of marijuana use and progression to problem use is stable over time in European-American women, but in African-American women, it varies by developmental period.

"Masculine discrepancy stress, teen dating violence, and sexual violence perpetration among adolescent boys.",Reidy DE; Smith-Darden JP; Cortina KS; Kernsmith RM; Kernsmith PD,"PURPOSE: Addressing gender norms is integral to understanding and ultimately preventing violence in both adolescent and adult intimate relationships. Males are affected by gender role expectations which require them to demonstrate attributes of strength, toughness, and dominance. Discrepancy stress is a form of gender role stress that occurs when boys and men fail to live up to the traditional gender norms set by society. Failure to live up to these gender role expectations may precipitate this experience of psychological distress in some males which, in turn, may increase the risk to engage in physically and sexually violent behaviors as a means of demonstrating masculinity. METHODS: Five-hundred eighty-nine adolescent males from schools in Wayne County, Michigan completed a survey assessing self-perceptions of gender role discrepancy, the experience of discrepancy stress, and history of physical and sexual dating violence. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses indicated boys who endorsed gender role discrepancy and associated discrepancy stress were generally at greater risk to engage in acts of sexual violence but not necessarily physical violence. CONCLUSIONS: Boys who experience stress about being perceived as ""sub-masculine"" may be more likely to engage in sexual violence as a means of demonstrating their masculinity to self and/or others and thwarting potential ""threats"" to their masculinity by dating partners. Efforts to prevent sexual violence perpetration among male adolescents should perhaps consider the influence of gender socialization in this population and include efforts to reduce distress about masculine socialization in primary prevention strategies.",2015,Jun,J Adolesc Health,56,6,619-24,,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.02.009,26003576,#214,Reidy 2015,"",""

Women in detention are vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation and at greatest risk of HIV while detained in police holding cells, where they are typically supervised by male officers, in contrast to prisons, where they have little contact with male staff. HIV risk for men in prison is associated with consensual and non-consensual sex; this risk is perpetuated by a pervasive culture of denial and institutionalised homophobia. The illegal nature of sodomy and male-to-male sex provides Correctional Services the legal grounds by which to refuse access to condoms for prisoners.

Beyond gender: proximity to interpersonal trauma in examining differences in believing child abuse disclosures.,Miller KE; Cromer LD,"Survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA) often delay disclosing or do not disclose the abuse for fear of not being believed. Studies document that women believe CSA disclosures more often than do men. Little research has examined theoretical underpinnings for gender differences in believing. However, 1 theory suggests that women may be more empathetic to disclosures because interpersonal trauma (IPT) is proximal to their lives. The present study aimed to extend understanding of how proximity to IPT may shape views of others' experiences of IPT. This study examined whether proximity to IPT (i.e., knowing a close other who had experienced IPT) rather than personal experience would better account for the robust gender differences typically found in believing disclosures. College students (N = 279) completed self-report measures about their personal trauma history and responded to questions regarding knowledge of close others' trauma histories. Participants read a vignette of an adult female disclosing CSA and rated the disclosure for believability. Results indicate that exposure to IPT increased believing, whereas gender did not. These results suggest that one's proximity to IPT may be an alternative explanation for influence on believing CSA rather than gender alone.",2015,,J Trauma Dissociation,16,2,211-23,,10.1080/15299732.2014.985863,25517856,#219,Miller 2015,"",""

The high rate of OCD among sexually abused MMT women was not found in women who are sexually abused non-addicts.

Gender significantly moderated several effects in the model. For women, the effect of psychological distress on HAART adherence was mediated by drug use and the effect of drug use on viral load was mediated by HAART adherence. Among men, drug use did not significantly impact adherence. Since gender appears to moderate the effect of drug use on medication adherence, it is particularly important to address drug use within the context of HIV disease management in women with a history of CSA.

The data from the primary study yielded rich and revealing themes involving participants' experiences with humor in the context of their leadership roles, justifying a secondary analysis focusing specifically on these experiences. Relevant remarks were extracted, coded, and summarized. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Participants discussed two broad types of humor-related experiences. First, they described how they responded to aggressive gender-based humor directed at themselves or their colleagues by tolerating it or expressing disapproval. This humor includes demeaning quips, insulting monikers, sexist jokes, and derogatory stories. Participants often did not confront this humor directly as they feared being rejected or ostracized by colleagues. Second, they described how they initiated humor to address gender-related workplace issues by highlighting gender inequalities, coping with sexual harassment and assault, and managing gender-based leadership challenges. Participants felt constrained in their own use of humor because of the need to be taken seriously as women leaders. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Women leaders in academic medicine use humor to confront gender-related issues and experience aggressive gender-based humor in the workplace.

Personal experiences of harassment (sexual harassment, bullying, abuse, and discrimination) by other health care personnel, event reporting, burnout and exit from medicine, fear of retaliation, and related outcomes were included. Interventions across all surgical specialties in any country to decrease incidence of harassment were also evaluated. Abstracts and potentially relevant full-text articles were double screened.: Eligible studies were extracted into standard forms. Risk of bias and certainty of evidence of included research were assessed. A meta-analysis was not performed owing to heterogeneity of outcomes. <ovid:br/>Finding(s): A total of 10 eligible studies among 5852 participants addressed prevalence and 12 eligible studies among 2906 participants addressed interventions. The prevalence of sexual harassment (range, 250 of 907 physicians [27.6%] to 181 of 255 female gynecologic oncologists [70.9%]), workplace discrimination (range, 142 of 249 gynecologic oncologists [57.0%] to 354 of 527 gynecologic oncologists [67.2%] among women; 138 of 358 gynecologic oncologists among males [38.5%]), and bullying (131 of 248 female gynecologic oncologists [52.8%]) was frequent among OB-GYN respondents. OB-GYN trainees commonly experienced sexual harassment (253 of 366 respondents [69.1%]), which included gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion. The proportion of OB-GYN clinicians who reported their sexual harassment to anyone ranged from 21 of 250 AAGL (formerly, the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists) members (8.4%) to 32 of 256 gynecologic oncologists (12.5%) compared with 32.6% of OB-GYN trainees. Mistreatment during their OB-GYN rotation was indicated by 168 of 668 medical students surveyed (25.1%). Perpetrators of harassment included physicians (30.1%), other trainees (13.1%), and operating room staff (7.7%). Various interventions were used and studied, which were associated with improved recognition of bias and reporting (eg, implementation of a video- and discussion-based mistreatment program during a surgery clerkship was associated with a decrease in medical student mistreatment reports from 14 reports in previous year to 9 reports in the first year and 4 in the second year after implementation). However, no significant decrease in the frequency of sexual harassment was found with any intervention. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: This study found high rates of harassment behaviors within OB-GYN. Interventions to limit these behaviors were not adequately studied, were limited mostly to medical students, and typically did not specifically address sexual or other forms of harassment.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Medical Association.

The Media and Sexual Violence Among Adolescents: Findings from a Qualitative Study of Educators Across Vietnam,Anderson K.M.; ; Macler A.; Bergenfeld I.; Trang Q.T.; Yount K.M.,"Growing access to technology and media has presented new avenues of influence on youth attitudes and norms regarding sexuality and sexual violence, as well as new technological pathways through which to perpetrate sexual violence. The aim of this research was to understand contextual influences on and needs for scale-up of sexual violence prevention programming in the media-violence context of Vietnam. We conducted 45 interviews with high school teachers (n = 15), university lecturers (n = 15), and affiliates from youth-focused community service organizations (n = 15) from across Vietnam. Additionally, we conducted four sector-specific focus groups with a sub-sample of interview participants (k = 4, n = 22). Media and technology were brought up consistently in relation to sexual violence prevention and sexual health information. Key informants noted that, in Vietnam, generational differences in acceptability of sex and lack of comprehensive sexuality education intersect with new technological opportunities for exposure to sexual information and media. This creates a complex landscape that can promote sexual violence through priming processes, instigate mimicry of violent media, and presents new opportunities for the perpetration of sexual violence though technology. Development of comprehensive sexual education, including violence prevention education, is imperative, with consideration of age-specific needs for Vietnamese youth.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

Stereotype Threat and Gender Bias in Internal Medicine Residency: It is Still Hard to be in Charge,Frank A.K.; ; Lin J.J.; Warren S.B.; Bullock J.L.; O'Sullivan P.; Malishchak L.E.; Berman R.A.; Yialamas M.A.; Hauer K.E.,"Background: Despite similar numbers of women and men in internal medicine (IM) residency, women face unique challenges. Stereotype threat is hypothesized to contribute to underrepresentation of women in academic leadership, and exploring how it manifests in residency may provide insight into forces that perpetuate gender disparities. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To quantify the prevalence of stereotype threat in IM residency and explore experiences contributing to that stereotype threat. <ovid:br/>Design(s): We used a mixed methods study design. First, we surveyed IM residents using the Stereotype Vulnerability Scale (SVS) to screen for stereotype threat. Second, we conducted focus groups with women who scored high on the SVS to understand experiences that led to stereotype threat. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): The survey was sent to all IM residents at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in September-November 2019. Focus groups were conducted at UCSF in Spring 2020. Approach: The survey included an adapted version of the SVS. For focus groups, we developed a focus group guide informed by literature on stereotype threat. We used a thematic approach to data analysis. The mixed methods design enabled us to draw metainferences by integrating the two data sources. Key Results: Survey response rate was 61% (110/181). Women were significantly more likely than men to have a score indicating stereotype threat vulnerability (77% vs 0%, p < 0.001). Four themes from focus groups characterized women's experiences of gender bias and stereotype threat: gender norm tension, microaggressions and sexual harassment, authority questioned, and support and allyship. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender-based stereotype threat is highly prevalent among women IM residents. This phenomenon poses a threat to confidence and ability to execute patient care responsibilities, detracting from well-being and professional development.

Sex Disparities in Ophthalmology From Training Through Practice A Systematic Review,Rousta N.; ; Hussein I.M.; Kohly R.P.,"IMPORTANCE Sex-based research in medicine has revealed inequities against females on almost every metric at almost every career stage; ophthalmology is no exception. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the experiences of females in ophthalmology (FiO) from training through practice in high-income countries (HICs). EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic review of English-language studies, published between January 1990 and May 2022, relating to FiO in HICs was performed. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase electronic databases were searched, as well as the Journal of Academic Ophthalmology as it was not indexed in the searched databases. Studies were organized by theme at each career stage, starting in medical school when an interest in ophthalmology is expressed, and extending up to retirement. FINDINGS A total of 91 studies, 87 cross-sectional and 4 cohort, were included. In medical school, mentorship and recruitment of female students into ophthalmology was influenced by sex bias, with fewer females identifying with ophthalmologist mentors and gender stereotypes perpetuated in reference letters written by both male and female referees. In residency, females had unequal learning opportunities, with lower surgical case volumes than male trainees and fewer females pursued fellowships in lucrative subspecialties. In practice, female ophthalmologists had lower incomes, less academic success, and poorer representation in leadership roles. Female ophthalmologists had a greater scholarly impact factor than their male counterparts, but this was only after approximately 30 years of publication experience. Pervasive throughout all stages of training and practice was the experience of greater sexual harassment among females from both patients and colleagues. Despite these disparities, some studies found that females reported equal overall career satisfaction rating with males in ophthalmology, whereas others suggested higher burnout rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Ophthalmology is approaching sex parity, however, the increase in the proportion of females in ophthalmology had not translated to an increase in female representation in leadership positions. Sex disparities persisted across many domains including recruitment, training, practice patterns, academic productivity, and income. Interventions may improve sex equity in the field.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Medical Association.

Perceptions of lecturers and students regarding discriminatory experiences and sexual harassment in academic medicine - results from a faculty-wide quantitative study,Ludwig S.; ; Jenner S.; Berger R.; Tappert S.; Kurmeyer C.; Oertelt-Prigione S.; Petzold M.,"BACKGROUND: Discrimination and sexual harassment are prevalent in higher education institutions and can affect students, faculty members and employees. Herein the aim was to assess the extent of discriminatory experiences and sexual harassment of students and lecturers at one of the largest teaching hospitals in Europe. We analyze whether there are differences between lecturers and students, different study programs as well as sex/gender differences. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In an interdisciplinary, iterative process, a semi-standardized questionnaire was developed and sent to N = 7095 students (S) of all study programs and N = 2528 lecturers (L) at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany. The study was conducted from November 2018 to February 2019. Besides a broad range of questions on sociodemographic background allowing for diversity sensitive data analysis, they were asked if they had witnessed and/or experienced any form of discrimination or sexual harassment at the medical faculty, if yes, how often, the perceived reasons, situational factors and perpetrators. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The response rate was 14% (n = 964) for students and 11% (n = 275) for lecturers. A proportion of 49.6% of students (L: 31%) reported that they have witnessed and/or experienced discriminatory behavior. Sexual harassment was witnessed and/or experienced by 23.6% of students (L: 19.2%). Lecturers (85.9%) were identified as the main source of discriminatory behavior by students. Directors/supervisors (47.4%) were stated as the main source of discriminatory behavior by lecturers.

SUPPORTING AND EMPOWERING MEDICAL WOMEN THROUGH A PODCAST,Bhayankaram N.P.; ,"Introduction Women represent 77% of the NHS workforce. The Medical Women's Federation is the largest body of women doctors in the UK and was founded in February 1917 as a way to support women becoming and remaining doctors. In the 106 years since the organisation was founded, there has been an exponential increase in the proportion of medical women, from 5% of UK doctors in 1917 to over 60%. However, medical women still face multiple challenges including sexism, harassment, unconscious and conscious bias. Women are also more likely to take career breaks and work less than full time in order to support children or relatives. Podcasts have become a popular and free educational resource and became hugely popular during the pandemic. There were no podcasts aimed at supporting and empowering medical women in their careers, so I decided to launch the world's first podcast with this aim, The Medical Women Podcast. Aims and objectives of the research project or activity The aim of this project was to design and deliver an innovative podcast as a free resource to support and empower as many medical women in their careers as possible, to help reduce the gender inequity in medicine. Method or approach I examined existing podcasts and found that there were multiple podcasts aimed at women but none particularly aimed at medical women. I designed the first series of episodes to be applicable to medical women from medical students to senior doctors in all specialties. I came up with topics that would be relevant to all of these medical women, such as leadership, speaking confidently, managing finances. I sought out speakers inside and outside of medicine so that we could learn from a broad range of speakers. Although the target audience are women, I ensured that there was diversity in the voices heard on the podcast. I launched the podcast in February 2022, in celebration of the Medical Women's Federation's 105th Birthday. I have since hosted and produced four seasons of podcasts with over 60 episodes that exists as a free resource that anyone can listen to. Findings The podcast has grown in popularity and regularly has between 100-200 listeners per week. To date I have hosted and produced over 60 episodes with over 11,000 downloads and listens in at least 66 countries. 90% of listeners are women, mostly aged 25-45, which fits the demographic for junior doctors to medical women in senior roles. The most popular episodes have been on: creating impact without burnout, how to speak confidently, leadership and financial literacy. I have recently produced a mini-series on women's health in collaboration with Health Innovation Kent Surrey Sussex, to encourage medical women to look after their health during their life course and to encourage innovators to develop new innovations on women's health. Topics covered included fertility, menopause and skin health. Since launching The Medical Women Podcast, there have been more podcasts produced aimed at women in medicine. This shows that there is a demand and need for resources specifically aimed at medical women. I have had feedback on the podcast from multiple listeners who have ranged from medical students to retired consultants. Their feedback has been that the podcast has inspired them in their careers and given them the confidence to apply for leadership roles. Key messages Women make up the majority of the NHS workforce and continue to face barriers to career progression compared with men, such as sexism, sexual harassment and bias. The Medical Women's Podcast has been the world's first podcast produced with the aim of supporting and empowering medical women in their careers. The podcast has become popular and inspired other medical women to start podcasts. This shows there is demand for podcasts supporting women in medicine. The most popular episodes have been on burnout, speaking confidently and leadership. Developing more innovations in these areas are likely to be popular and help to reduce the gender inequity in medicine.",2024,/,BMJ Leader,8,Supplement 1,A19EP  - A20,644491530,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/leader-2024-FMLM.26,,#238,Bhayankaram 2024,"",""
Burnout Among Mid-Career Academic Medical Faculty,Paradis K.C.; ; Kerr E.A.; Griffith K.A.; Cutter C.M.; Feldman E.L.; Singer K.; Spector N.D.; Ubel P.A.; Jagsi R.,"Importance: Studies reveal that most physicians report symptoms of burnout. Less is known about burnout in mid-career medical faculty specifically. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To characterize burnout and its risk factors, particularly differences by gender, among mid-career medical faculty. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Between August 2021 and August 2022, a survey was sent to 1430 individuals who received new National Institutes of Health K08 and K23 career development awards from 2006 to 2009. Data were analyzed between June and October 2023. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Personal and work-related burnout as evaluated using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). The CBI score ranges from 0 to 100, with a score of 50 or higher indicating a high degree of burnout. Multivariable models were used to investigate associations between burnout and participant characteristics, including race and ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity, academic rank, work climate, experiences of workplace sexual harassment, sleep hours, work and domestic caregiving time, and time allocation changes in work and domestic work hours compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Work climate was evaluated by a general climate elements scale assessing elements such as friendliness, respect, and collegiality, and a diversity, equity, and inclusion climate elements scale assessing elements such as homogeneity, sexism, and homophobia; higher scores indicated a more favorable view of the climate. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In all, 1430 surveys were sent, 926 candidates responded (65% response rate), and the analytic cohort was limited to the 841 respondents who were still in academic medicine (50.7% men).

In multivariable models, personal burnout was significantly more likely for women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.29 [95% CI, 1.54-3.41]; P <.001) and with more weekly hours of patient care (AOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15] for each 5-hour increase; P =.04). Personal burnout was less likely with more nightly sleep hours (AOR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.56-0.81] for each 1-hour increase; P <.001) and with an improved general work climate rating (AOR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48-0.85] for each 1-point increase in general work climate scale score; P =.002). Work-related burnout was also significantly more likely for women than men (AOR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.17-2.69]; P =.007). Greater work-related burnout was associated with an increase of 8 or more work hours per week compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.13-3.08]; P =.01), more weekly hours of patient care (AOR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03-1.19] for each 5-hour increase; P =.007), and a workplace sexual harassment experience in the past 2 years (AOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.11-2.62]; P =.01).

Closing the gender gap in medicine: the impact of a simulation-based confidence and negotiation course for women in graduate medical education,Bona A.; ; Ahmed R.; Falvo L.; Welch J.; Heniff M.; Cooper D.; Sarmiento E.; Hobgood C.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, 75-80% of the medical workforce worldwide consists of women. Yet, women comprise 21% of full professors and less than 20% of department chairs and medical school deans. Identified causes of gender disparities are multifactorial including work-life responsibilities, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, bias, lack of confidence, gender differences in negotiation and leadership emergence, and lack of mentorship, networking, and/or sponsorship. A promising intervention for the advancement of women faculty is the implementation of Career Development Programs (CDPs). Women physician CDP participants were shown to be promoted in rank at the same rate as men by year five, and more likely to remain in academics after eight years compared to both men and women counterparts. The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel, simulation-based, single-day CDP curriculum for upper-level women physician trainees to teach communication skills identified as contributing to medicine's gender advancement gap. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This was a pilot, pre/post study performed in a simulation center implementing a curriculum developed to educate women physicians on 5 identified communication skills recognized to potentially reduce the gender gap. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included confidence surveys, cognitive questionnaires, and performance action checklists for five workplace scenarios. Assessment data were analyzed using scored medians and descriptive statistics, applying Wilcoxon test estimation to compare pre- versus post-curriculum intervention scores, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Eleven residents and fellows participated in the curriculum. Confidence, knowledge, and performance improved significantly after completion of the program. Pre-confidence: 28 (19.0-31.0); Post-confidence: 41 (35.0-47.0); p < 0.0001. Pre-knowledge: 9.0 (6.0-11.00); Post knowledge: 13.0 (11.0-15.0); p < 0.0001. Pre-performance: 35.0 (16.0-52.0); Post-performance: 46.0 (37-53.00); p < 0.0001. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Overall, this study demonstrated the successful creation of a novel, condensed CDP curriculum based on 5 identified communication skills needed for women physician trainees. The post-curriculum assessment demonstrated improved confidence, knowledge, and performance. Ideally, all women medical trainees would have access to convenient, accessible, and affordable courses teaching these crucial communication skills to prepare them for careers in medicine to strive to reduce the gender gap.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

Sexual violence against sexual minority women in STEM: Compound backlash,Reidy D.E.; ; Baumler E.R.; Temple J.R.,"Background: Recent research has found that gender parity (i.e., the ratio of women to men) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines is associated with sexual violence (SV) victimization for women. This finding may reflect a type of backlash wherein SV is a means of punishing women who are perceived to be violating their gender roles and threatening the male hegemony. Sexual minorities, who are likewise disproportionately victims of SV, report experiencing heterosexist hostility and harassment in STEM disciplines. There is reason to suspect that the combination of these marginalized identity positions (e.g., a sexual minority woman in gender-balanced STEM) may amplify perceived gender role violations and exacerbate the risk of SV victimization. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data were collected from undergraduate women at five institutions of higher education in the United States. Sampling was stratified by STEM vs. non-STEM majors and male-dominated vs. gender-balanced majors. Sexual violence was measured via the revised Sexual Experiences Survey. We tested the interaction of sexual minority status and gender parity in STEM on SV via fixed effects OLS regression. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sexual minority women in gender-balanced STEM were most frequently victims of SV. Women in male-dominated STEM majors were at no greater risk of SV victimization, regardless of sexual minority status, than their peers in non-STEM majors. Implications: These findings suggest the possibility of a compound form of backlash, wherein women are exponentially victimized because their sexual identity and their membership in these STEM fields are seen as dual challenges to the male hegemony. If true, this could exacerbate health disparities rather than promote health equity for these sexual minority women. Findings point to the ongoing need to challenge hegemonic gender norms, focus prevention programs on populations most at risk, and ensure they are provided the appropriate resources for support.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,/,Social Science and Medicine,338,"(Reidy) School of Public Health & Center for Research on Interpersonal Violence, Georgia State University, United States(Baumler, Temple) Center for Violence Prevention, University of Texas Medical Branch, United States",116366,2028303702,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116366,37949019,#242,Reidy 2023,"",""
"Women in Allergy and Immunology: The Future Is Female, Let Us Soar!",Blumenthal K.G.; ; Bansal P.; Youssef C.M.; Pappalardo A.A.,"Despite increases in the number of female physicians in the past 50 years, women remain underrepresented in key areas of medicine, such as practice owners and partners, professional society leaders, principal investigators, full professors, chairs, and deans. Women are paid less, oftentimes for more work. Allergy and Immunology (AI), as a specialty, lacks substantial workforce research, but trends across specialties are consistent. We review what is currently known about women in AI and consider barriers to practice, advancement, and contribution. Through a new inquiry, we find that the challenges women in AI encounter can be summarized through 6 themes: work-life balance, professional advancement, salary equity, mentorship and sponsorship, bias, and sexual harassment and misconduct. Together, we must address these challenges head-on and provide an equitable environment for women in AI to thrive, especially those affected by intersectionality. To do so, we suggest targeted, tangible actions to promote opportunities, offer institutional support, and advance reporting and culture change outlets across AI settings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",2023,/,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice,11,12,3569EP  - 3577,2025404737,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2023.06.010,37315689,#243,Blumenthal 2023,"",""
Sexual Violence against Women in STEM: A Test of Backlash Theory Among Undergraduate Women,Reidy D.E.; ; Salazar L.F.; Baumler E.; Wood L.; Daigle L.E.,"It has been argued that increasing the number of women in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields could mitigate violence against women by advancing gender equality. However, some research points to a ""backlash"" effect wherein gains in gender equality are associated with heighted sexual violence (SV) against women. In this study, we compare SV against undergraduate women majoring in STEM disciplines to those majoring in non-STEM disciplines. Data were collected between July and October of 2020 from undergraduate women (N = 318) at five institutions of higher education in the United States. Sampling was stratified by STEM versus non-STEM majors and male-dominated versus gender-balanced majors. SV was measured using the revised Sexual Experiences Survey. Results indicated that women majoring in STEM disciplines that are gender balanced reported more SV victimization in the form of sexual coercion, attempted sexual coercion, attempted rape, and rape compared to their peers in both gender-balanced and male-dominated non-STEM and male-dominated STEM majors. These associations held even after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, victimization prior to college, sexual orientation, college binge drinking, and hard drug use during college. These data suggest that the risk of repeated SV victimization within STEM populations may be a threat to sustained gender parity in these fields and ultimately to gender equality and equity. Gender balance in STEM should not be furthered without addressing the potential use of SV as a potential means of social control over women.",2023,/,Journal of interpersonal violence,38,13-14,8357EP  - 8376,640373081,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08862605231155124,36803036,#244,Reidy 2023,"",""
Status of Women in Neurosurgery: Results from a National Survey in Italy,Scerrati A.; ; Angelini C.; Madoglio A.; Lucidi D.; Parini S.; Verdi D.; Gumbs A.A.; Spolverato G.,"Background: Gender inequity in surgery has increasingly been a matter of debate. Contributions of female neurosurgeons to academic medicine and societies are poorly highlighted. The aim of this study was to evaluate several aspects of the professional and work-life balance of female neurosurgeons in Italy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data of the female neurosurgical population were extracted from a general 83-item questionnaire administered to a total of 3242 respondents. The survey was composed of multiple-choice questions investigating demographics, surgical training and practice, satisfaction, mentorship, discrimination, and harassment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 98 female neurosurgeons were included. Most responders were married or cohabiting (49%). Thirty-nine (43%) were planning to have children, and 15 of them (44%) stated the reason they still didn't have any was because of professional constraints. Seventy (71%) women were neurosurgeons with an academic position (residents or academics) and 28 (29%) were full-time attendings. Most of the female neurosurgeons are satisfied with their work: sometimes (35%), often (20%), and always or almost always (20%). Most of them (45%) stated they are rarely victims of harassment, but 66% think that they are treated differently because they are women. A similar rate for a poor and fulfilling work-life balance (34% and 35%, respectively) was detected.

Patterns of Violence Victimization and Disclosure Among Transgender/Gender Nonconforming and Cisgender Latinx College Students,O'Connor J.; ; Ganson K.T.; Ladonice S.; Cardenas I.,"Although research on sexual violence experiences of minoritized college students has increased in recent years, little is known about the experiences of Latinx students. Even less knowledge is available on whether such violence and disclosure experiences vary by gender identity. The present study addressed this gap by exploring the rates of sexual violence and disclosure patterns after experiences of sexual violence among Latinx college students. Using data from the 2019-2020 Healthy Minds Study, a national sample of Latinx college students was analyzed (n = 6,690). Descriptive statistics, chi2 tests, and one-way analyses of variance were conducted to explore differences in gender identity, sexual violence victimization, and disclosure type. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between (1) gender identity and sexual violence victimization and (2) gender identity and sexual violence disclosure while controlling for various sociodemographic measures. Results indicated sexual violence victimization occurred at significantly higher rates among transgender/gender nonconforming and cisgender women Latinx students, compared to cisgender men. Transgender/gender nonconforming students who experienced sexual violence were significantly less likely to make any disclosure of sexual violence when compared to cisgender men. These findings highlight the extent to which experiences of sexual violence among Latinx students differ based on their gender identity. It also brings attention to the need for campus programming to attend to students who often face structural barriers because of their intersecting identities, specifically transgender/gender nonconforming Latinx students.",2023,/,Journal of interpersonal violence,38,7-8,6017EP  - 6037,639206153,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08862605221127217,36197008,#248,O'Connor 2023,"",""

SWRO members include faculty and trainee radiation oncologists and medical physicists. We aim to assess the current experiences of SWRO members using a comprehensive survey of gender-related workforce issues we developed. Data was used to establish a 5-year benchmark. Materials/Methods: From January to February 2023, an anonymous survey was distributed to current SWRO members. Questions included demographics, family planning/fertility issues, perceptions of the field, and membership needs. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize frequencies of the multiple-choice items on the survey. <ovid:br/>Result(s): On interim analysis, 115 of 680 (17%) completed the survey from 11 countries, 81% of which reside in the US. 55% were faculty physicians, 26% resident physicians, 10% faculty physicists, and 3% physics residents. The majority were female (97%) and either married or in a domestic partnership (74%). 47% reported having at least one child, and 26% reported that they or their partner became pregnant during residency. Length of leave was impacted by residents' desire to complete residency training on schedule. 53% felt RO was perceived as family-friendly, but much fewer (17%) agreed that it is. After clinical responsibilities (70%), insufficient mentorship was cited as the second most common limitation to professional productivity (35%). 48% reported being somewhat or extremely satisfied with current mentorship availability at their institution, while 56% reported being similarly satisfied with the mentorship available within the field. 69% reported seeking or having sought female mentorship outside of their institution. Unwanted sexual comments, attention, or advances by superiors or colleagues was reported by 38% of respondents.

Interpersonal Interactions and Biases in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency: Do Experiences Differ Based on Gender?,Sobel A.D.; ; Lavorgna T.R.; Ames S.E.; Templeton K.J.; Mulcahey M.K.,"BackgroundWomen residents are underrepresented in orthopaedic surgery. The causes of the deficit of women in orthopaedic surgery are multifactorial, but by identifying the perceptions of women in orthopaedic residency training and comparing them with the perceptions of men, we can improve our understanding of ways to enhance the recruitment of qualified and diverse candidates.Questions/purposes(1) What differences exist in the perceived experiences of residents identifying as women and men regarding professional, social, and personal interactions during residency training? (2) Are there differences in the percentage of women and men residents who have experienced harassment or discrimination in preresidency interviews, and are there differences in the type of harassment or discrimination experienced?MethodsA survey was generated using Academy of Critical Care: Development, Evaluation, and Methodology guidelines. Two focus groups with seven attending orthopaedic surgeons who participate in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group and who are experts on gender diversity in orthopaedics were held to improve survey validity. The survey included binary-response, Likert, and free-text questions on the perception of professional, social, and personal interactions held by the resident being surveyed. The questions focused on a respondent's perception of interactions with staff members, patients, resident colleagues, and attending surgeons, as well as sexual harassment. Program directors at 10 selected Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited orthopaedic residency programs that participate in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group shared the survey with residents at their institutions. There were 95 programs in the Collaborative Orthopaedic Education Research Group at the time this survey was distributed. In this program, directors or other interested teaching faculty in orthopaedic residency programs voluntarily participate to discuss and develop quality research on resident and fellow education. These 95 programs account for 46% of the ACGME-accredited programs in the United States at the time the survey was created and distributed. The 10 residency programs had a total of 232 enrolled residents; 15% (34) identified as women. This gender distribution models the national sample of orthopaedic residents. Survey reliability was assessed by calculating the Cronbach alpha after determining the variance in each relevant (nondemographic) survey item. The final survey was found to have excellent internal reliability (alpha = 0.95). Responses from residents identifying as women and those identifying as men were compared using Fisher exact tests for all categorical data, and two-tailed independent t-tests were used for all continuous data. Differences in each survey category (professional interactions, social interactions, personal interactions, and sexual harassment in preresidency interview experiences) were calculated.ResultsWomen reported experiencing microaggressions (left undefined to the survey respondent, but generally considered to be subtle, stunning, often automatic, and nonverbal exchanges that are ""put downs"") at work more frequently than men did (40% [six of 15] versus 5% [four of 74]; p < 0.001). Specifically, women perceived being interrupted (53% [eight of 15] versus 5% [four of 75]); p < 0.001) by men colleagues, called by their first name (67% [10 of 15] versus 4% [3 of 72]; p < 0.001), and given administrative tasks (27% [four of 15] versus 1% [one of 75]; p = 0.004) more often than men. More women than men perceived that patients (33% [five of 15] versus 0 of 74 [0%]; p < 0.001) and hospital staff (27% [four of 15] versus 7% [five of 74]; p = 0.01) respected their opinion less than that of men. More women than men perceived that group humor negatively targeted their gender (47% [seven of 15] versus 1% [one of 75]; p < 0.001) and that criticism of their surgical skill was based on their gender rather than their ability (33% [five of 15] versus 5% [four of 78]; p = 0.005). In residency or subinternship interviews, 20% of women reported experiencing sexual harassment as defined by a listing of known types of harassment in the question stem, compared with 0% of men (p = 0.004). Women reported harassment in the form of verbal remarks of a sexual nature and obscene images in the workplace, whereas men did not report any form of harassment during interviews.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the greatest discrepancies in the perceived experiences of women and men residents lie in professional interactions, and women residents are more likely to experience sexual harassment and disparaging humor than men residents.Clinical RelevanceAddressing these discrepancies, particularly in the professional setting, will help to create a more inclusive work environment and attract more women to orthopaedic surgery. Annual distribution of the survey used in this study by program directors to residents in their programs can help to identify discrepant perceptions that, coupled with the collection of objective data, can be targeted for improvement.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Impact of discrimination on training and career of radiation oncologists in France,Aziez S.; ; Evin C.; Azria D.; Montpetit E.; Gannam Y.; Ruffier A.; Vendrely V.; Laprie A.; Huguet F.,"Purpose or Objective In France, radiation oncology remains predominantly male, as women represented 44% of radiation oncologists. Many studies have highlighted gender disparities in medicine. Disparities in salaries, publications, and representation in key positions have been reported. Some studies have looked also at the impact of discrimination related to ethnic origin or sexual orientation. However, this kind of study has not been conducted in France yet. The main objective of our study was to assess the current situation, study the factors that may influence disparities, and to propose solutions for improvement. Materials and Methods An anonymous online questionnaire, inspired by the one used in 2021by the ESMO W4O group, was disseminated to all the residents and radiation oncologists in France between March and June 2022. It included questions related to professional experience, gender, socio-ethnicity, sexual orientation, personal life, as well as a section dedicated to academic research. Results Among the 999 radiation oncology practitioners and 168 residents in France, 225 questionnaires were collected (19.2%). Among the responders, 135 (60%) were women and 90 were men (40%). The mean age was 39.2 years, 25% were residents and 75% were practitioners. Among the practitioners, 42% were practicing in a cancer center, 25% in a teaching university hospital, and 23% in a private institution. The career satisfaction rate was 92%, with no gender difference. Gender had a negative impact on the career in 65% of the women, social origin had a negative impact in 37% of the responders, and ethnic origin in 25%. People who had been discriminated on the basis of their ethnic origin had a lower rate of job satisfaction (8.7% versus 91%, p<0.001). Moreover, 20% of respondents have been racially discriminated by a patient. Sixty-two percent of women reported having experienced inappropriate behavior or sexual harassment in the workplace, and 4% sexual assault. Thirty-eight percent of women felt that having a child had ""extremely"" or ""very"" impacted their career against 8.5% of men (p<0.001). Ten percent of women felt that there had been no change in gender equality compared to 1% of men (p<0.001). The most popular proposals for improvement were the ""Creation of specific educational programs"" (42% of women versus 22% of men, p<0.01), the creation of a ""Network of women radiation oncologists"" (41% versus 3.3%; p<0.001), and the ""Addition of quotas in institutions, associations and key positions"" (39% versus 10%; p<0.001). Conclusion This study is the first one establishing an inventory of the various discriminations experienced by radiation oncologists in France. Additionally, it has allowed us to identify the main obstacles met in their career by women and to analyze the factors that may explain these inequalities. We make a few propositions for improvement to guarantee the best working and training conditions, regardless of the origin and gender.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,/,Radiotherapy and Oncology,182,Supplement 1,S195EP  - S196,2025976729,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140%2823%2908553-5,,#251,Aziez 2023,"",""
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN UROLOGY: SOCIETY OF WOMEN IN UROLOGY CENSUS FINDINGS,McMurray M.; ; Guerrios-Rivera L.; Sandozi A.; De S.; Mehta A.; Monn F.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Sexual harassment and gender discrimination toward female surgeons is a longstanding, wellrecognized issue. As more women pursue training in urology, we must acknowledge the distinct challenges women urologists face within our specialty. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sexual harassment of women urologists and trainees and to understand the factors associated with this behavior. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): An electronic survey census was sent to all members of the Society of Women in Urology including residents, fellows, and women urologists practicing in the United States and territories. Surveys were also distributed to urology residency programs and via social media platforms. In addition to demographic data, we solicited information about whether respondents experienced sexual harassment and allowed for free-text descriptions of these events. Results were compiled and analyzed using descriptive statistics. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 379 total female respondents with an average age of 43 (SD=18.6) years old. Of these, 75.0% were urologists in practice, 15.1% residents, and 9.8% fellows. 62.5% of respondents reported experiencing sexual harassment in training or in practice. Of those who reported experiencing sexual harassment, 70.9% described patient-perpetrated harassment, 59.5% had been harassed by a physician colleague, and 33.3% had experienced harassment from both sources. Common themes included: comments about physician appearance or clothing, inappropriate sexual comments or questions, inappropriate physical touch, and sexual advances. Only 16.0% of respondents who had experienced sexual harassment chose to report it. The incidence of harassment by each group overall, including rates of reporting, are summarized in Figure 1. Common reasons for not reporting included: presumption of institutional indifference, fear of retaliation, feeling it was not worth the time or effort, and a feeling of intimidation due to a power dynamic. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Sexual harassment of women urologists by patients and colleagues is common and grossly underreported. Creating environments in which women feel safe to report without repercussion and clinical settings in which sexual harassment is not tolerated by patients or physicians is critical as the number of women practicing urology increases.

However, little is known about (1) the representation of women SEMP practitioners in team positions, (2) the recruitment processes and training for SEMP practitioners and (3) culture/experiences, gender and possible sexual harassment for those working in elite sport in Australia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): All titled Australian Physiotherapy Association Sport and Exercise Physiotherapists, Sport and Exercise Medicine Practitioners, and doctors and physiotherapists working in Australian elite sport were invited to participate in the project (Feb - April 2022). All participants completed a tailored online survey and a validated Gender Experiences Questionnaire (GEQ). <ovid:br/>Result(s): (1) Gender representation of those currently working in elite sport in Australia There was equal representation of women (117) and men (105) answering the survey who were working in elite sport settings in Australia. However, men were more often in paid positions compared to women (95% versus 88%) and paid for more weeks each year (mean 43 weeks compared to 26 weeks). Women spent 23% of their time undertaking unpaid work, compared to only 15% of men's working time. Women SEMP practitioners were 6.86 (95%CI 3.49 to 14.01) times more likely than men to work with more women athletes. (2) Recruitment process for elite sport There were no gender differences in how elite sports roles were promoted. The vast majority of roles were not advertised with direct approach (men 59% (95%CI 48 to 68%); women 63% (95%CI 52 to 70%)) being the most common method of job 'advertisement' /recruitment. (3) Culture/experiences, gender and sexual harassment for those working in elite sport in Australia. Women were 4.01 (95%CI 1.88 to 8.80) times more likely than men to agree that their gender and/or sexual orientation influenced their opportunities in elite sport. Women currently working in elite sport experienced significantly more infantilisation, work/family policing and gender policing than men. Women also reported feeling less supported to discuss/ disclose these issues in their workplace (OR ranging 2.8 to 15.34). <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Gender equity in SEMP position in elite sport in Australia does not translate to gender pay equality. Women SEMP practitioners were more likely to work with women athletes who are paid less, have lower public profiles and receive less media attention, than their men counterparts, which potentially impacts renumeration available for SEMP practitioners. Furthering the disadvantage, women working in elite sport worked less paid hours per week and less paid weeks per year. SEMP practitioners were appointed to positions without established procedures: i.e. most SEMP roles were not advertised, nor had formal and transparent recruitment processes. The robust assessment of gender harassment by the GEQ highlighted the significant challenges for women SEMP practitioners in the elite sport workplace. Men acknowledged that their gender positively influenced their SEMP career, whereas women experienced negative effects of gender. Impact/Application to the field: Consistent with other workplaces, women working in elite sport in Australia experience significantly more workplace gender harassment than men, it is time for affirmative action to eliminate gender bias and harassment in the SEMP workplace.

AOA Critical Issues: Gender Justice in Academic Medicine: What It Might Look Like in Orthopaedic Surgery,Day C.S.; ; Lattanza L.; Van Heest A.; Templeton K.; Fore J.A.; Ode G.E.,"As the number of women entering medicine has increased, so has the number of women entering orthopaedics; however, many orthopaedic programs struggle to create an equitable space for women, particularly in leadership. Struggles experienced by women include sexual harassment and gender bias, lack of visibility, lack of well-being, disproportionate family care responsibilities, and lack of flexibility in the criteria for promotions. Historically, sexual harassment and bias has been a problem faced by women physicians, and often the harassment continues even when the issue has been reported; many women find that reporting it results in negative consequences for their career and training. Additionally, throughout medical training, women are less exposed to orthopaedics and lack the mentorship that is given to their colleagues who are men. The late exposure and lack of support prevent women from entering and advancing in orthopaedic training. Typical surgery culture can also result in women orthopaedic surgeons avoiding help for mental wellness. Improving well-being culture requires systemic changes. Finally, women in academics perceive decreased equality in promotional considerations and face leadership that already lacks representation of women. This paper presents solutions to assist in developing equitable work environments for all academic clinicians.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Gender Disparity in Academic Gastroenterology: Beginning of the End of the Underrepresentation of Women?,John J.J.; ; John E.S.; Pioppo L.; Gupta A.; Chokhavatia S.; Tilara A.,"Background: Though there are an increasing number of female medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in academic medicine. There have been several reasons to explain this gender disparity, including marital status, number of children, number of hours worked, job flexibility, perceptions of women as inferior leaders, gender bias, sexual harassment, and unsupportive academic climates. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This study aimed to investigate the relationship between scholarly productivity and the representation of female gastroenterologists in academia. Specifically, scholarly productivity measured by the h-index and academic rank were explored to determine if there were gender disparities in academic productivity and rank in gastroenterology. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Gastroenterology departmental listings were obtained from the Fellowship and Residency Interactive Database of the American Medical Association. The Scopus database was used to record each physician's h-index. Statistical analyses were conducted with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which compared matched samples by academic rank, and ANOVA tests, which compared multiple academic ranks. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Out of 1703 academic gastroenterologists, women account for 25% of academic physicians. Women have statistically lower h-indices at the level of Assistant Professor (p = 0.0012), and at the level of Chair (p = 0.01). There was no difference in h-indices between male and female at the rank of Associate Professor and Professor. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While these results mirror patterns appreciated in other fields of medicine, the results at the rank of Chair may suggest that despite the lower h-index compared to their male counterparts, females are perceived as having strong inherent leadership skills outside of academic productivity that are also conducive to leading a department and may be contributing to their rise to Chair.

However, this positive trend towards gender equity in sports has not transpired for women in medicine, especially in fields that care for elite athletes. This current review will discuss specific areas that can be tailored to help female athletes prevent injuries and optimize their athletic performance. We will also highlight how increased female team physician representation in sports may help optimize care for female athletes. Recent Findings: Female athletes are considered high risk for certain conditions such as ACL tears, patellofemoral pain syndrome, bone stress injuries, sport-related concussions, and sexual violence in sport. Addressing factors specific to female athletes has been found to be valuable in preventing injuries. Strength and conditioning can optimize athletic performance but remains underutilized among female athletes. Although diversity in healthcare workforce has been found to be beneficial for multiple reasons, women remain underrepresented in sports medicine. Increasing female team physician representation may positively impact care for female athletes. <ovid:br/>Summary: Team physicians must understand the physiologic, biomechanical, and anatomic factors that are unique to female athletes in order to tailor injury prevention programs and optimize their athletic performance. Advocating for gender equity in sports medicine to advance representation of women in the field will increase workforce diversity and promote excellence in sports medicine care.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s).",2022,/,Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine,15,1,10EP  - 20,2014713727,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12178-021-09735-2,,#256,deBorja 2022,"",""
Prevention Strategies for Sexual Harassment in Academic Medicine: A Qualitative Study,Jenner S.C.; ; Djermester P.; Oertelt-Prigione S.,"Sexual harassment and gendered discrimination in the workplace are global issues that can affect anyone regardless of their age, gender, job title, or field of employment. The medical field is also relevantly concerned, yet effective prevention measures are scarce. The purpose of this study was to explore preventive options for sexual harassment in an academic medical context from the employees' perspective and to develop transferable strategies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 female physicians and 15 female nurses working at a tertiary referral center in Berlin, Germany, in the months of April to November 2015. The one-on-one interviews addressed the perception of sexual harassment and available and desirable preventive measures. Data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The participants outlined preventive measures at two levels: individual and institutional. Individual options included personal safety measures and individual protection strategies against patients, peers, and superiors. Institutional strategies included guidelines and workplace policies, structured complaint and reporting procedures, formal training options, and organizational development and leadership strategies. The current study highlights how the prevention of sexual harassment hinges on a combination of individualized and system-wide measures to capture the personal as well as the organizational dimension of sexual harassment. Only a concerted effort addressing both aspects will sensitize the workforce, support the victims, and prevent sexual harassment in medical institutions.",2022,/,Journal of interpersonal violence,37,5-6,NP2490EP  - NP2515,630775263,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260520903130,31999215,#257,Jenner 2022,"",""
Mentoring Relationships and Gender Inequities in Academic Medicine: Findings From a Multi-Institutional Qualitative Study,Murphy M.; ; Record H.; Callander J.K.; Dohan D.; Grandis J.R.,"PURPOSE: This study examined how mentoring relationships may reinforce or mitigate gender inequities in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In-depth, semistructured interviews with medical school faculty members (52 women and 52 men) were conducted at 16 institutions across the United States in 2019. Institutions were recruited using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity in geography, ownership (private or public), and prestige. Within institutions, purposive sampling was used to recruit equal numbers of women and men and to seek diversity in degree type (MD, PhD), age, and career stage. A coding scheme was developed through iterative analysis of the interview transcripts. All interview transcripts were then coded with the goal of identifying intersections between mentorship and experiences of and responses to gender inequities. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Four key themes at the intersection of mentoring relationships and gender inequities were identified. (1) Both women and men became aware of gender inequities in academic medicine through relationships with women mentors and mentees. (2) Both women and men mentors recognized the challenges their female mentees faced and made deliberate efforts to help them navigate an inequitable environment. (3) Both women and men mentors modeled work-family balance and created family friendly environments for their mentees. (4) Some women, but no men, reported being sexually harassed by mentors. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities are acknowledged and mitigated. It also shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities, such as sexual harassment, may occur. Sexual harassment in academic medicine has been widely documented, and gender inequity in academic medicine has proved persistent. While mentoring relationships may have the potential to identify and mitigate gender inequities, this study suggests that this potential remains largely unrealized.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2022,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,97,1,136EP  - 142,636099119,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004388,34495884,#258,Murphy 2022,"",""
Gender-based violence attitudes and dating violence experiences of students in nursing and other health sciences: A multicentre cross-sectional study,Freijomil-Vazquez C.; ; Movilla-Fernandez M.-J.; Coronado C.; Seoane-Pillado T.; Muniz J.,"BACKGROUND: Gender-based violence is a major public health problem. Healthcare providers' ability to identify this type of violence and support victims may be influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, which requires solid education. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): To identify the gender-based violence attitudes and dating violence experiences of students in nursing and other health sciences. DESIGN: A multicentre cross-sectional study was performed. SETTINGS: This study was conducted in three faculties of the University of A Coruna, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were undergraduate students of nursing, podiatry, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The Attitudes towards Gender and Violence Questionnaire and the Dating Violence Questionnaire were used from October 2019 to March 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated to determine associated factors and identify differences in gender-based violence attitudes and dating violence experiences between sexes and degrees. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Data from 459 students were analysed, of whom 180 (39.2 %) studied nursing. The mean age was 20.9 (SD = 3.6) and 76.0 % were women. Statistically significant differences were obtained in attitudes towards gender-based violence according to sex where men displayed more sexist attitudes and violence justification. Results showed a significant difference in attitudes regarding the biological usefulness of sexism and violence between students of nursing and other health sciences. 61.9 % of students had experienced one or more abusive behaviours in relationships; no significant differences were detected according to the degree. However, male students experienced dating violence more often than females. It was observed that students who had suffered dating violence showed greater agreement with sexist attitudes that justify violence. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Students of health sciences, particularly males and nursing students, show sexist attitudes that justify gender-based violence. They also frequently experience dating violence, especially psychological violence. It is necessary to intensify or include education on these types of violence in the curricula of degrees in health sciences.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Experiences and Impacts of Harassment and Discrimination Among Women in Cardiac Medicine and Surgery: A Single-Center Qualitative Study,Ruzycki S.M.; ; McFadden C.; Jenkins J.; Kuriachan V.; Keir M.,"Background: Gender- and sex-based harassment and discrimination are consistently reported by about 50% of women physicians, and the prevalence may be even greater among women in cardiology. An exploration of these experiences and their impacts on women in healthcare is necessary to design interventions, create supports, and facilitate empathy, support, and allyship among leadership. <ovid:br/>Method(s): To understand and describe the experiences of harassment and discrimination among women working in cardiac sciences, to inform the design of interventions and supports, we performed one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with women in the Department of Cardiac Sciences in a single institute. Interviews were coded independently in parallel using thematic analysis and reconciled by trained qualitative researchers. Experiences were categorized as harassment using the Canadian Human Rights Act. Codes were grouped into themes by iterative discussion. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 15 participants, including trainees, physicians in a variety of cardiac subdisciplines, and nurse practitioners. All participants had experienced sex- or gender-based discrimination at work, though the impact and perception of these experiences varied. Whereas some participants felt that these experiences had little influence on their careers or personal lives, others changed practice specialties or locations due to harassment. Several participants had been sexually assaulted at work. Interviews revealed modifiable barriers to reporting harassment. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This qualitative dataset enriches the prevalence data on sex- and gender-based harassment among women working in cardiology by describing the impacts and perceptions of this harassment. Organizations should address commonly described barriers to reporting harassment, including addressing retaliation, and create systems-level supports for those affected by harassment.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors",2022,/,CJC Open,4,8,676EP  - 684,2019313947,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2022.04.003,,#262,Ruzycki 2022,"",""
"Women in neurointervention, a gender gap? Results of a prospective online survey",Power S.; ; Biondi A.; Saatci I.; Bennett K.; Mahadevan J.; Januel A.C.; Singhara Na Ayudhaya S.; Agid R.,"Background and Purpose: Women's representation in medicine has increased over time yet the proportion of women practicing neurointervention remains low. We conducted an anonymous online survey through which we could explore the gender gap in neurointervention, identify potential issues, difficulties, or obstacles women might face, and evaluate if men encounter similar issues. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An online questionnaire was designed in SurveyMonkey. Invitation to participate was emailed through national and international neurointerventional societies as well as directly through private mailing lists to men and women working in neurointervention. Responses were collected from 10 May 2019 to 10 September 2019. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 295 complete responses, 173 (59%) male and 122 (41%) female. Most respondents (83%) fell within age categories 35-60 years, with representation from 40 countries across five continents. In all 95% were working full time, 73% had worked as a neurointerventionalist for >6 years, 77% worked in University-affiliated teaching institutions. Almost half of the respondents indicated no female neurointerventionalist worked in their center. Female respondents were younger and age-adjusted analysis was undertaken. Significantly fewer females than males were married and had children. Significantly fewer females held supervisory roles, held academic titles, and significantly less had a mentor. Females were less satisfied in their careers. More females felt they receive less recognition than colleagues of the opposite sex. Males had a greater proportion of work time dedicated to neurointervention. Similar proportions of both genders experienced bullying in work (40%-47%); however, sexual harassment was more common for females. There were no differences between genders in how they dealt with complications or their effects on mental well-being. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There are many potential reasons why women are underrepresented in neurointervention, however, the literature suggests this is not unique to our specialty.

Taking Our Own Temperature: Using a Residency Climate Survey to Support Minority Voices,Smith R.; ; Johnson A.; Targan A.; Piggott C.; Kvach E.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recruitment of underrepresented minorities (URM) in medicine has risen to the forefront as a strategy to address health inequities, but the experiences of URM residents within their own programs are poorly understood. We describe the development and implementation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate survey at our residency program, the results of which have informed our DEI efforts. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A resident-faculty work group collaboratively developed an 81-item questionnaire, informed by other institutional climate surveys. We administered the survey annually from 2018 through 2021 to all residents and faculty at our large academic family medicine residency program. The anonymous survey covered six key areas: general climate, climate for specific group, personal experience with discrimination and harassment, recruitment, burnout, and curriculum. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Average response rates were 84% and 50% for residents and faculty, respectively. Survey results show low satisfaction with resident and faculty diversity; higher rates of burnout for respondents who self-identify as URM, persons of color (POC), and/or LGBTQ; and racial and gender differences in experiences of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Instituting an annual internal climate survey at our residency has provided invaluable information regarding the perspectives and experiences of our residents and faculty that has informed our DEI initiatives.

Harassment as a consequence and cause of inequality in academia: A narrative review,Tauber S.; ; Loyens K.; Oertelt-Prigione S.; Kubbe I.,"A growing body of literature suggests that over the past 30 years, policies aimed at tackling harassment in academia have had little discernable effect. How can this impasse be overcome to make the higher education sector a safe space for everyone? We combine the areas of harassment and inequality, intersectionality, policy-practice gaps, gender sensitive medicine, as well as corruption and whistleblower processes to identify lacunae and offer recommendations for how to apply our recommendations in practice. We have been searching the most influential, relevant, and recent literature on harassment and inequality in our respective fields of expertise. By studying conceptual overlaps between the different fields, we were able to create insights that go beyond the insights of the most recent reviews. Our synthesis results in three concrete recommendations. First, harassment and inequality are mutually reinforcing. Failure to adequately tackle harassment contributes to perpetuating and reproducing inequality. Further, the intersectional nature of inequality has to be acknowledged and acted upon. Second, enforcing anti-harassment policies should be a top priority for universities, funders, and policymakers. Third, sexual harassment should be treated as institutional-level integrity failure. The higher education sector should now focus on enforcing existing anti-harassment policies by holding universities accountable for their effective implementation - or risk being complicit in maintaining and reproducing inequality. <ovid:br/>Funding(s): We have received no funding for this research.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s)",2022,/,eClinicalMedicine,49,"(Tauber) University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands(Loyens) Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands(Oertelt-Prigione) Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands(Oertelt-Prigione) Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany(Kubbe) Tel Aviv",101486,2018629522,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101486,,#266,Tauber 2022,"",""
Student and clinician perceptions of medical student mistreatment: A cross-sectional vignette survey,Peckston D.C.; ; Urwin R.; McMullan R.; Westbrook J.,"Objectives The mistreatment of medical students remains pervasive in medical education. Understanding the extent to which clinicians and students recognise mistreatment can assist in creating targeted interventions that reduce mistreatment. The objective of this study was to use clinical vignettes to assess perceptions of medical student mistreatment among medical students and clinical faculty at an Australian university. Design, setting and participants This cross-sectional study used a survey of medical students and clinical faculty in a Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected via an online survey between 13 July and 27 July 2020. Outcome measures Fourteen clinical vignettes were developed based on commonly reported themes of mistreatment. An additional control vignette was also included, and these 15 vignettes were distributed via email to all 169 MD students and 42 teaching faculty at this teaching site. Participants were asked to rate whether the vignettes portrayed mistreatment on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Results Respondents included 83 MD students and 34 clinical faculty. On average, students perceived mistreatment in 9 of 14 vignettes and faculty in 8 of 14 vignettes. Faculty and student perceptions aligned in themes of sexual abuse, physical abuse and in the control vignette depicting a constructive teaching style. Perceptions differed significantly between faculty and students (p<0.05) for five vignettes across the themes of gender discrimination, requests of students to perform non-educational tasks, humiliation, specialty choice discrimination and requests to perform a task beyond the student's capacity. Conclusion Agreement on what constitutes appropriate behaviour is crucial to ensuring that a culture of mistreatment can be replaced with one of kindness, equity and respect.

Gender analysis of oncology expert participation on online professional platforms,Kunzman J.; ; Henry E.; Housri N.; Kamran S.C.; Kunz P.L.; Lee L.E.; LoConte N.K.; Burt L.,"Background: Social media platforms have been highlighted as a tool to help promote gender equity by amplifying women in medicine and providing means for collaboration and networking. However, limitations of social networks include sexual harassment and persistent gender biases. While the number of female trainees entering oncology specialties has mostly equalized, gender disparities persist among faculty in promotion, publishing, and leadership positions. We sought to characterize the engagement of female and male oncologists via a private, moderated knowledge-sharing platform, theMednet.org, which disseminates expert knowledge via question-and-answer format. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Questions were posted by registered oncologists on theMednet.org and reviewed by a team of physician editors who then invited selected experts to respond. Experts were selected by the editorial team based on research prominence, academic rank, leadership, and other expert recommendations. Physician information, such as role (academic, community, or trainee), specialty (radiation oncology (RO), medical oncology (MO)), questions asked, and questions answered were analyzed from June 2014 through June 2022. The gender of each physician was determined from their associated National Provider Identifier (NPI), which is recorded as female or male; users without an associated NPI were excluded from the data set. Statistical significance was determined through unpaired two-tailed T-tests and chi-squared testing. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among RO and MO physicians, 3376 were identified as female and 6011 were identified as male. Female faculty make up 42% of experts, which was proportionate to the percent of female users. Female and male experts were invited to answer questions at similar rates for all specialties; however, male experts answered questions at a statistically significantly higher rate in RO (51% vs 18%) and MO (27.5% vs 14%) (Table). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While female and male experts were equally invited to answer questions, male experts were significantly more likely to answer questions. As online platforms are increasingly raising the prominence of academics on a national level, lower engagement by female experts may further compound gender disparities in academia.

Assessing Pediatric Faculty Perceptions of Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment,Slater A.C.; ; Thomas A.; Quan L.; Bell S.; Bradford M.C.; Rosenberg A.R.; Walker-Harding L.R.,"Background: Background Physicians who identify as women experience gender discrimination and sexual harassment in academic medicine. Although Pediatrics has reported more women than men since 1989, it is likely that gender-based inequities exist. We aimed to examine hospital-based pediatricians' experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Methods An anonymous survey was distributed to all faculty in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington. Survey items included demographic data and a modified version of the Overt Gender Discrimination at Work (ODGW) Scale, questions about the frequency with which the faculty member experienced/witnessed discriminatory treatment, and questions about experiences with sexual harassment. Surveys also asked whether these experiences negatively impacted confidence and career advancement. We hypothesized that women would report more discrimination and harassment than men. Responses were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Male and female responses were compared using Chi squared tests. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Results Of 524 Pediatrics faculty, 290 (55%) completed the survey. Women more commonly reported feeling they have been treated unfairly due to gender than men (50% vs. 4%, p<0.01) and feeling gender was a limitation (35% vs. 4%, p<0.01). Women also reported discriminatory treatment at least annually (51% vs. 4%, p<0.01) and reported encountering sexist remarks, unwanted attention, or advances (24% vs. 15%, p=0.08). More women reported that these discriminatory experiences negatively impacted their confidence and their career advancement (48% and 50%, respectively) compared to men (12% and 9%, p<0.01). Additionally, women who identified as Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and Mixed race or Other reported a higher rate of being treated unfairly due to their gender as compared to their peers. See Table 1. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Conclusion Consistent with literature prior to pediatrics being dominated by women, faculty who identify as women in pediatrics report greater instances of of gender discrimination and harassment than men, regardless of the amount of women in the majority. Further studies are needed to determine if this bias exists at other institutions and to assess how this gender bias affects attrition and how these results affect direct specific efforts aimed at eliminating gender discrimination and harassment within Pediatrics.

Gender inequality in academia: Problems and solutions for women faculty in STEM,Casad B.J.; ; Franks J.E.; Garasky C.E.; Kittleman M.M.; Roesler A.C.; Hall D.Y.; Petzel Z.W.,"Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender-biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., ""geeky"" decor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation-funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2021,/,Journal of Neuroscience Research,99,1,13EP  - 23,2007059475,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24631,33103281,#274,Casad 2021,"",""
"Prevalence of Discrimination, Abuse, and Harassment in Emergency Medicine Residency Training in the US",Lall M.D.; ; Bilimoria K.Y.; Lu D.W.; Zhan T.; Barton M.A.; Hu Y.-Y.; Beeson M.S.; Adams J.G.; Nelson L.S.; Baren J.M.,"Importance: The prevalence of workplace mistreatment and its association with the well-being of emergency medicine (EM) residents is unclear. More information about the sources of mistreatment might encourage residency leadership to develop and implement more effective strategies to improve professional well-being not only during residency but also throughout the physician's career. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To examine the prevalence, types, and sources of perceived workplace mistreatment during training among EM residents in the US and the association between mistreatment and suicidal ideation. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): In this survey study conducted from February 25 to 29, 2020, all residents enrolled in EM residencies accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) who participated in the 2020 American Board of Emergency Medicine computer-based In-training Examination were invited to participate.

State of woman in Plastic Surgery in Uruguay,Pazos L.D.; ; Corbellini M.C.; Garcia E.C.; Cunha A.,"Background and objective. Despite the increase in women in Medicine, a lot of work still needs to be done in terms of equality between men and women. This inequality is accentuated in surgical specialties. The objective of this work is to analyze the situation of women in Plastic Surgery in Uruguay. We describe the bond between professional development with family (partner/children), academy training, discrimination and sexual harassment, and the influence of a mentor during training. Methods. An electronic, anonymous and voluntary survey was carried out, without incentive to complete it. It was sent to the members and non-members of the Society of Plastic Surgery in Uruguay. Results. Eighty-six responses were obtained from plastic surgeons and residents of the specialty: 47 women (54.7%) and 39 men (45.3%). Conclusions. This is the first study carried out in our country analyzing the situation of plastic surgeons and its bond between work, family, motherhood, academic work, discrimination, sexual harassment and the importance of mentors of the same gender. The data obtained revealed that in some aspects women surgeons in Uruguay suffer the same situation as the rest of the world. Nonetheless, we have a Society with a high percentage of women, that is increasing. A population of plastic surgeons where the age of having the first child and having children before or during residency did not vary between men and women. A specialty where the majority deny the presence of sexual harassment, discrimination or having postponed maternity/paternity due to Plastic Surgery.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Plastica Reparadora y Estetica (SECPRE).

"Feminism, gender medicine and beyond: a feminist analysis of ""gender medicine""",Shai A.; ; Koffler S.; Hashiloni-Dolev Y.,"The feminist women's health movement empowered women's knowledge regarding their health and battled against paternalistic and oppressive practices within healthcare systems. Gender Medicine (GM) is a new discipline that studies the effect of sex/gender on general health. The international society for gender medicine (IGM) was embraced by the FDA and granted funds by the European Union to formulate policies for medical practice and research. We conducted a review of IGM publications and policy statements in scientific journals and popular media. We found that while biological differences between men and women are emphasized, the impact of society on women is under- represented. The effect of gender-related violence, race, ethnic conflicts, poverty, immigration and discrimination on women's health is seldom recognized. Contrary to feminist practice, GM is practiced by physicians and scientists, neglecting voices of other disciplines and of women themselves. In this article we show that while GM may promote some aspects of women's health, at the same time it reaffirms conservative positions on sex and gender that can serve to justify discrimination and disregard the impact of society on women's lives and health. An alternative approach, that integrates feminist thinking and practices into medical science, practice and policies is likely to result in a deep and beneficiary change in women's health worldwide.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, The Author(s).",2021,/,International Journal for Equity in Health,20,1,177,2013374391,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01511-5,34344374,#277,Shai 2021,"",""
Current status and solutions for gender equity in anaesthesia research,Flexman A.M.; ; Shillcutt S.K.; Davies S.; Lorello G.R.,"Despite increasing numbers of women entering anaesthesia, they remain persistently under-represented within academic anaesthesia and research. Gender discordance is seen across multiple aspects of research, including authorship, editorship, peer review, grant receipt, speaking and leading. Women are also under-represented at higher faculty ranks and in department chair positions. These inequities are further magnified for women with intersectional identities, such as those who identify as Black, indigenous and women of colour. Several barriers to participation in research have been identified to date, including a disproportionate amount of family responsibilities, a disproportionate burden of clinical service, gender bias, sexual harassment and the gender pay gap. Several strategies to improve gender equity have been proposed. Increasing access to formal mentorship of women in academic medicine is frequently cited and has been used by healthcare institutions and medical societies. Senior faculty and leaders must also be conscious of including women in sponsorship and networking opportunities. Institutions should provide support for parents of all genders, including supportive parental leave policies and flexible work models. Women should also be materially supported to attend formal educational conferences targeted for women, aimed at improving networking, peer support and professional development. Finally, leaders must display a clear intolerance for sexual harassment and discrimination to drive culture change. Peers and leaders alike, of all genders, can act as upstanders and speak up on behalf of targets of discrimination, both in the moment or after the fact. Gender inequities have persisted for far too long and can no longer be ignored. Diversifying the anaesthesia research community is essential to the future of the field.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Association of Anaesthetists",2021,/,Anaesthesia,76,S4,32EP  - 38,2010707194,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anae.15361,33682100,#278,Flexman 2021,"",""
"State of women in medicine: History, challenges, and the benefits of a diverse workforce",Joseph M.M.; ; Ahasic A.M.; Clark J.; Templeton K.,"Women in medicine have made progress since Elizabeth Blackwell: the first women to receive her medical degree in the United States in 1849. Yet although women currently represent just over one-half of medical school applicants and matriculates, they continue to face many challenges that hinder them from entering residency, achieving leadership positions that exhibit final decision-making and budgetary power, and, in academic medicine, being promoted. Challenges include gender bias in promotion, salary inequity, professional isolation, bullying, sexual harassment, and lack of recognition, all of which lead to higher rates of attrition and burnout in women physicians. These challenges are even greater for women from groups that have historically been marginalized and excluded, in all aspects of their career and especially in achieving leadership positions. It is important to note that, in several studies, it was indicated that women physicians are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, provide preventive care and psychosocial counseling, and spend more time with their patients than their male peers. Additionally, some studies reveal improved clinical outcomes with women physicians. Therefore, it is critical for health care systems to promote workforce diversity in medicine and support women physicians in their career development and success and their wellness from early to late career.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the American Academy of Pediatrics",2021,/,Pediatrics,148,"(Joseph) Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, College of Medicine-Jacksonville, University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL, United States(Ahasic) Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, ",e2021051440C,2014459453,https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-051440C,34470878,#280,Joseph 2021,"",""
"""Am I Making More of It Than I Should?"": Reporting and Responding to Sexual Harassment",Russell H.A.; ; Fogarty C.T.; McDaniel S.H.; Naumburg E.H.; Nofziger A.; Rosenberg T.; Sanders M.; Fiscella K.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health professionals may face sexual harassment from patients, faculty, and colleagues. Medicine's hierarchy deters response to sexual harassment. Current evidence consists largely of quantitative data regarding the frequency and types of sexual harassment. More information is needed about the nature of the experience and how or why professionals choose to report or respond. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We developed and administered a semistructured interview guide to elicit family medicine faculty and residents' experiences with sexual harassment and gender bias. Facilitators led a series of focus groups divided by faculty (N=28) and residents (N=24). We ensured voluntary consent and groups were audiotaped, transcribed and deidentified. We coded the transcripts using immersion-crystallization theory to identify emergent themes. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Sexual harassment from patients and colleagues was described as witnessed or personally experienced by faculty and resident participants in 100% of the focus groups. Respondents identified the presence of mentors, clear reporting process and follow-up, history of good organizational response to reporting, and education and training as facilitators to reporting sexual harassment. Barriers to reporting included fear of retaliation, lack of trust of the system to respond, lack of clarity about ""what counts,"" and confusion with the reporting process. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): It is important to capitalize on facilitators to reporting sexual harassment, starting with acknowledging the frequency of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

Reaching Men and Women at Risk of Committing Sexual Offences - Findings From the National Swedish Telephone Helpline PrevenTell,Adebahr R.; ; Soderstrom E.Z.; Arver S.; Jokinen J.; Oberg K.G.,"Background: In 2012 the Swedish Helpline project PrevenTell, targeting men and women with self-identified out-of-control and paraphilic sexual behavior, was launched by ANOVA, Karolinska University Hospital. The overall purpose was to reach the target group and via a telephone-contact encourage further on-site assessment and treatment. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): To describe men and women contacting PrevenTell during the first 7 years by delineate sexuality-related risk-factors for sexual violence, gender differences, and age- and gender-preferences when reporting a pedophilic interest. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A 52-item semi-structured telephone interview was conducted by experts in sexual medicine with individuals who contacted the helpline. The interview covered sociodemographic characteristics, problematic sexual behavior(s), and mental health and based on the information reported, interventions included recommending an appointment at ANOVA, supporting other appropriate healthcare, or motivation of individuals still ambivalent to treatment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Data collection took place between March 2012 and October 2019. A total of 1573 respondents in the main target group (1454 men and 119 women) gave informed consent for participation. Compulsive sexual behavior was reported by 69% of respondents and 56% described at least one paraphilic interest. The prevalence of concomitant compulsive sexual behavior and a paraphilic interest was high, varying between 65% and 83%. Significant gender differences were found in socioeconomic and mental health variables, in which women showed fewer positive and stable life factors compared to men. A sexual preference for minors was reported by 24% of respondents. In this group, 63% reported use of child sexual exploitation material and 15% committed child sexual abuse. Respondents were offered anonymity, however 55% disclosed their identity and were enrolled for further assessment and treatment at ANOVA. Clinical Implications: The result of this study is of substantial relevance when developing secondary preventive initiatives targeting sexual violence in the community. <ovid:br/>Strengths and Limitations: This is the first study to present data from a national helpline targeting both men and women with a wide range of self-identified problematic sexual behaviors. Limitations include the lack of diagnostic confirmation on-site, hence, presented data provides only an indication of clinical conditions. Furthermore, the main objective of the interview was to motivate participants to seek further treatment, sometimes necessary to prioritize this over adherence to the semi-structured questionnaire, explaining the relatively high absence rate in some variables. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Men and women at risk of committing sexual crimes can be reached through a national helpline service and motivated to undergo further assessment and treatment.

Why don't more women choose cardiology interviews with female internal medicine residents,Logan J.; ; Tummala L.; Arundel C.; Hopkins H.; Chretien K.,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, about 43% of third year medicine residents were women, but only 26% of cardiology first year fellows were female. Given lack of data on the transition from residency to fellowship, we sought to understand what barriers preclude female medicine residents from pursuing cardiology fellowships. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of female medicine residents regarding cardiology. Female medicine residents from five local training institutions were recruited by email. A female medicine attending consented and interviewed each volunteer. The interview was about 75 minutes and addressed career and personal goals, experiences with cardiology, and gender inequities. Notes were taken and the interviewer summarized the main participant's responses as a form of member checking. The research team discussed and analyzed interview notes for themes using an iterative process. This study was approved by the local IRB. It was closed early due to the COVID pandemic. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Five PGY2 residents from two different programs were interviewed. Seven themes were identified: mentoring, research support, the impact of fellows on resident experience, negative perceptions of cardiology, sexually offensive comments and behavior, the gender pay gap and work- life balance. The need for facilitated mentoring and research were major themes. Many of the female residents described a desire to pursue cardiology in medical school but were unable to find mentors in residency. The residents' perceptions of cardiology were consistently unfavorable. A lack of teaching, older and largely male faculty, and unwelcoming fellows contributed to this perception. The residents interviewed were aware of how gender impacted their career. They described being perceived as less competent than male colleagues and being subjected to inappropriate behavior by patients. The female residents struggled with the anticipated pay gap, being judged for childbearing and unequal balance of work at home. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): In this qualitative study exploring gender disparities in cardiology, we identified potential barriers and opportunities. Several themes have previously been identified in the literature including lack of mentorship. Our findings indicate that there is still work to be done to match female residents with mentors and research opportunities, which might be helped by partnerships across institutions. Fellows play a key role in residency training and should be encouraged to mentor residents. The themes of sexual harassment and the gender pay gap provide areas for educational interventions to equip female residents with the tools to combat harassment and skills related to financial literacy.

How can men be good allies for women in surgery? #HeForShe,Wood D.E.; ,"Men have long been the dominant force in surgery, particularly in cardiothoracic surgery, and this has resulted in a tradition of a masculine culture that is not receptive to women. As a result, cardiothoracic surgery fails to recruit talented female surgeons, and with now over 50% of medical students being women, this means that cardiothoracic surgery potentially loses half of the physician talent pool. When women pursue a career in surgery, they face innumerable challenges and barriers, ranging from outright sexual harassment to daily microaggressions that demonstrate gender biases about perceived competence, work ethic, commitment, and professional ability. Women frequently suffer from unequal opportunities in clinical, academic, or leadership roles, and this can be further represented by disparities in compensation and time to academic promotion. Men have an outsized role in helping to provide a professional environment in surgery that is attractive and welcoming to women, and in supporting a culture that empowers equal opportunity for career success and advancement to both men and women. This important role of men is particularly true in cardiothoracic surgery since over 90% of the workforce are male. First and foremost, men can be critical allies to their female colleagues by actively supporting and promoting the women they work beside every day. Men are also important mentors for women, providing a safe space for frank conversations and career advice, with the sincere best interests of the female colleague at heart. Finally, men are important sponsors for women colleagues as well, talking about them, promoting them, and helping launch them into committee or leadership positions, while opening doors for clinical or academic advancement. The advantage of this work to men is the development of rewarding and lifelong relationships with female colleagues, and the benefit of their own reciprocal mentorship and allyship. Men have as much to gain as women from a modernization of our specialty and mitigation of gender disparities that undermine equal opportunity for career advancement. Men should not stand on the sidelines, and should be engaged and proactive as they work with women for gender equality in surgery.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease.",2021,/,Journal of Thoracic Disease,13,1,492EP  - 501,2011035463,https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jtd-2020-wts-11,,#289,Wood 2021,"",""

"A brief interactive workshop increases confidence, comfort, and effectiveness of resident response to gender discrimination and sexual harassment",Farkas A.H.; ; Scholcoff C.; Shah H.; Lamberg M.; Yecies E.B.; Fletcher K.E.,"BACKGROUND: Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are common in academic medicine and associated with negative outcomes, including burnout, depression, and even thoughts of suicide. In qualitative work, providers who are unprepared to respond to these incidents often use indirect responses, such as ignoring the event or humor. These indirect responses can leave providers feeling guilty for not responding. While required harassment training is common, there are no published intervention for medical trainees to better prepare them to respond to incidents of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We adapted an in-person faculty development workshop to be given to internal medicine residents virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on in-person learning. The workshop had three components: 1) an introduction to the problem of sexual harassment in medicine, 2) cases for guided-practice responding to different instances of harassment, 3) review of Title IX. The workshop was presented to residents during protected academic time. Prior to the workshop all residents were invited to participate in a presurvey, which assessed their experience with gender-discrimination and sexual harassment during the prior 6 months, their response to these incidents, and self-reported preparedness to respond. A post-survey was sent to those who attended the workshop to assess satisfaction with and impact of the workshop. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Out of 119 residents, 89 (74.8%) completed the pre-survey. The majority, 65 (73.0%) of residents reported at least one incident of genderdiscrimination or sexual harassment in the prior 6 months, from either a patient, patient's family member, or colleague. When broken down into categories?, 62 (69.7%) reported an incident of gender harassment, 26 (29.6%) reported unwanted sexual attention, and 2 (2.3%) an incident of sexual coercion. The majority, 53 (62.4%), reported previous training, but only 28 (32.6%) felt well trained. 79 residents attended the workshop and 53 (67.1%) completed the post-survey. The majority of residents, 98.1%, felt the training was applicable, and 88.7% were satisfied with the training. Compared with before the workshop, residents reported more comfort (mean rating of 2.88 vs 3.39, p-value of 0.0304) and confidence (mean rating of 3.47 vs 3.88, p-value 0.0284) in responding to incidents of harassment. They were more likely to use active responses, such as express discomfort (15.0% vs 51.0%), express a preference (15.0% vs 53.1%), and de-brief (13.3% vs 63.3%) and less likely to ignore the incident (56.7% vs 34.7%). <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Incidents of gender-discrimination and sexual harassment are common in academic medicine and medical trainees do not feel prepared to respond to these incidents. This workshop offers one potential solution by better preparing residents to actively respond to these incidents.

Promoting Gender Equity in the #MeToo Era,Zhang D.; ; Pistorio A.L.; Payne D.; Lifchez S.D.,"The recent #MeToo movement in social media has brought the important issue of gender-based violence and harassment in the workplace to the forefront of public attention. As in other fields, gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment continue to be a problem in medicine, and gender inequalities are particularly apparent in surgical specialties. Whereas the #MeToo movement has successfully raised awareness and held some perpetrators accountable, there have been unintended backlashes, including reluctance from some male surgeons to mentor female surgeons for fear of false accusations of sexual misconduct at both the trainee and the faculty levels. Gender-based neglect is harmful to the career advancement of female surgeons and threatens to continue to promote gender inequalities in surgery.

The Podiatric Medical Profession: A Gender Comparison,Brower B.A.; ; Butterworth M.L.; Crawford M.E.; Jennings M.M.; Tan Z.; Moore J.D.; Suzuki S.; Carpenter B.B.,"The number of women in podiatric medicine and surgery has increased steadily over the past 4 decades; however, there appears to be a large and continued gender gap with respect to representation in academic medicine and other positions of power. National and state level organizational data were obtained from multiple podiatry professional societies to evaluate the rate at which women achieved leadership roles within the podiatric profession over time. A secondary questionnaire was also developed and electronically mailed to 8684 doctors of podiatric medicine to help capture additional leadership information and to provide further insight into the trends observed. The response rate was 26% (2276/8684). Female representation in academia, research/publications, most leadership positions, and board certifications has increased over time, but at a slower rate than the number of women entering the profession. We observed a decreasing trend of females completing fellowships, speaking at national meetings, becoming residency directors, and receiving American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons- and American Podiatric Medical Association-sponsored grants/awards. Based on the survey results, female podiatric physicians were more likely to be single, have fewer children, spend more time in a clinical setting, be less satisfied with work, and experience higher work stress levels than their male colleagues. Of the female respondents, 73% described experiencing gender discrimination at some point in their career, and 42% reported experiencing sexual harassment, compared with only 6% and 5% of men, respectively.

Has a critical mass of women resulted in gender equity in gynecologic surgery?,Heisler C.A.; ; Mark K.; Ton J.; Miller P.; Temkin S.M.,"Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women. Policies related to pregnancy and parenting may disproportionately affect the careers of women gynecologists.

"Sexting, online sexual victimization, and psychopathology correlates by sex: Depression, anxiety, and global psychopathology",Gasso A.M.; ; Mueller-johnson K.; Montiel I.,"Recent research on sexting highlighted a relationship between this new technology-mediated behavior and psychopathology correlates, although up to date results are mixed, and so far, studies have often used simple and not clinically validated measures of mental health. This study aimed to investigate sexting behaviors, online sexual victimization, and related mental health correlates using clinically validated measures for global psychopathology, anxiety, and depression; and doing so separately for men and women. The sample consisted of 1370 Spanish college students (73.6% female; 21.4 mean age; SD = 4.85) who took part in an online survey about their engagement in sexting behaviors, online sexual victimization behaviors, and psychopathological symptomatology, measured by a sexting scale and the Listado de Sintomas Breve (brief symptom checklist) (LSB-50), respectively. Out of our total sample, 37.1% of participants had created and sent their own sexual content (active sexting), 60.3% had received sexual content (passive sexting), and 35.5% had both sent and received sexual content, with significant differences between male and female engagement in passive sexting. No differences were found between men and women in the prevalence of their victimization by nonconsensual dissemination of sexual content; however, women were more pressured and threatened into sexting than men. Sex differences in psychopathology were found only for depression prevalence rates but not for global psychopathology or anxiety. Furthermore, for male participants, our results showed a significant association only between online sexual victimization and psychopathology but not for consensual active and passive sexting. However, for the female participants, active sexting, passive sexting, and online sexual victimization were all associated with poorer mental health.

Making it to the PhD: Gender and student performance in sub-Saharan Africa,Fisher M.; ; Nyabaro V.; Mendum R.; Osiru M.,"Women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) impedes progress in solving Africa's complex development problems. As in other regions, women's participation in STEM drops progressively moving up the education and career ladder, with women currently constituting 30% of Africa's STEM researchers. This study elucidates gender-based differences in PhD performance using new survey data from 227 alumni of STEM PhD programs in 17 African countries. We find that, compared to their male counterparts, sampled women had about one less paper accepted for publication during their doctoral studies and took about half a year longer to finish their PhD training. Negative binomial regression models provide insights on the observed differences in women's and men's PhD performance. Results indicate that the correlates of publication productivity and time to PhD completion are very similar for women and men, but some gender-based differences are observed. For publication output, we find that good supervision had a stronger impact for men than women; and getting married during the PhD reduced women's publication productivity but increased that of men. Becoming a parent during the PhD training was a key reason that women took longer to complete the PhD, according to our results. Findings suggest that having a female supervisor, attending an institution with gender policies in place, and pursuing the PhD in a department where sexual harassment by faculty was perceived as uncommon were enabling factors for women's timely completion of their doctoral studies. Two priority interventions emerge from this study: (1) family-friendly policies and facilities that are supportive of women's roles as wives and mothers and (2) fostering broader linkages and networks for women in STEM, including ensuring mentoring and supervisory support that is tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Fisher et al.",2020,/,PLoS ONE,15,12 December,e0241915,2010476432,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241915,33315871,#299,Fisher 2020,"",""
Leading by Design: Lessons for the Future From 25 Years of the Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) Program for Women,Jagsi R.; ; Spector N.D.,"The Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) Program for Women is designed to promote the careers of senior female leaders in academic health care in a way that ultimately seeks to transform culture and promote gender equity far beyond the careers of its participants. In an era of increased awareness of gender inequity within academic medicine, the longevity of the ELAM program raises several important questions. First, why is such a program still needed? Second, what exactly does it do, and what has been its influence on its participants and beyond? And third, what lessons can ELAM's example provide to help guide the medical profession as it strives to promote gender equity in the field? In this Invited Commentary, the authors seek to answer these questions from the perspective of a recent program participant and the current program director. The authors review the evidence that identifies how women, even today, face accumulating disadvantage over the course of their academic careers, stemming from repeated encounters with powerful unconscious biases and stereotypes, societal expectations for a gendered division of domestic labor, and still-present overt discrimination and sexual harassment. They describe ELAM's approach, which builds the knowledge and skills of the women who participate in the program, while also intentionally raising their visibility within their home institutions so that they have opportunities to share with institutional leaders what they have learned in ways that not only promote their own careers but also support gender equity in the broader environment. The authors conclude by offering thoughts on how ELAM's model may be leveraged in the future, ideally in partnership with the numerous professional societies, funding agencies, and other organizations that are committed to accelerating the rate of progress toward gender equity at all levels of academic medicine.",2020,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,95,10,1479EP  - 1482,633092994,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003577,33006867,#300,Jagsi 2020,"",""
Comparison of professionalism between emergency medicine resident physicians and faculty physicians: A multicenter cross-sectional study,Shiga T.; ; Nakashima Y.; Norisue Y.; Ikegami T.; Uechi T.; Otaki Y.; Nakano H.; Ryu K.; Wakai S.; Funakoshi H.; Fujitani S.; Tokuda Y.,"Professionalism is a critical competency for emergency medicine (EM) physicians, and professional behavior affects patient satisfaction. However, the findings of various studies indicate that there are differences in the interpretation of professionalism among EM resident physicians and faculty physicians. Using a cross-sectional survey, we aimed to analyze common challenges to medical professionalism for Japanese EM physicians and survey the extent of professionalism coursework completed during undergraduate medical education. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional survey of EM resident physicians and faculty physicians at academic conferences and eight teaching hospitals in Japan using the questionnaire by Barry and colleagues. We analyzed the frequency of providing either the best or second-best answers to each scenario as the main outcome measure and compared the frequencies between EM resident physicians and EM faculty physicians. Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyze data. A total of 176 physicians (86 EM resident physicians and 90 EM faculty physicians) completed the survey. The response rate was 92.6%. The most challenging scenario presented to participants dealt with sexual harassment, and only 44.5% chose the best or second-best answers, followed by poor responses to the confidentiality scenario (69.9%). The frequency of either the best or second-best responses to the confidentiality scenario was significantly greater for EM resident physicians than for EM faculty physicians (77.1% versus 62.9%, p = 0.048). More participants in the EM resident physician group completed formal courses in medical professionalism than those in the EM faculty physician group (25.8% versus 5.5%, p < 0.01). Further, EM faculty physicians were less likely than EM resident physicians to provide acceptable responses in terms of confidentiality, and few of both had received professionalism training through school curricula. Continuous professionalism education focused on the prevention of sexual harassment and gender gap is needed for both EM resident physicians and faculty physicians in Japan.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Shiga et al.

"Too male, too pale, too stale: A qualitative exploration of student experiences of gender bias within medical education",Brown M.E.L.; ; Hunt G.E.G.; Hughes F.; Finn G.M.,"Objective To explore medical student perceptions and experiences of gender bias within medical education. Setting Gender bias-a  prejudiced actions or thoughts based on the perception that women are not equal to men'-is a widespread issue. Within medicine, the pay gap, under-representation of women in senior roles and sexual harassment are among the most concerning issues demonstrating its presence and impact. While research investigating experiences of clinicians is gaining traction, investigation of medical students' experiences is lacking. This qualitative study analyses medical students' experiences of gender bias within their education to discern any patterns to this bias. Illuminating the current state of medical education gender bias will hopefully highlight areas in which student experience could be improved. Constructivist thematic analysis was used to analyse data, informed by William's patterns of gender bias, intersectional feminism and communities of practice theory. Participants Thirty-two medical students from multiple UK medical schools participated in individual interviews. Nine faculty members were also interviewed to triangulate data. Results Gender bias has an overt presence during medical student education, manifesting in line with William's patterns of bias, impacting career aspirations. Physical environments serve to manifest organisational values, sending implicit messages regarding who is most welcome-currently, this imagery remains a  too male, too pale..too stale'. Existing gender initiatives require careful scrutiny, as this work identifies the superficial application of positive action, and a failure to affect meaningful change. Conclusions Despite progress having been made regarding overt gender discrimination, implicit bias persists, with existing positive action inadequate in promoting the advancement of women. Institutions should mandate participation in implicit bias education programmes for all staff and must strive to revise the imagery within physical environments to better represent society. Gender initiatives, like Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, also require large-scale evaluation regarding their impact, which this work found to be lacking.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

A gender bias curriculum: Empowering our learners in the #metoo era,Roberts K.; ; Yim N.; Hayton A.,"Purpose of study The incidence of gender bias (GB) and sexual harassment (SH) is prevalent among medical students and residents. Challenges such as unfair treatment due to gender, discomfort while listening to sexual humor, and unwanted sexual advances are common, especially to female learners. These negative encounters are experienced as early as the preclinical years for many medical students and can lead to avoidance, withdrawal, ethical/moral distress, and burnout. Though some interventions involving educational workshops that focused on issues of GB/SH in medicine have shown to decrease GB/SH in various settings (including clinical and academic), there has yet to be data on effects of such methods in the earlier years of training. Methods used In this study, we conducted a 120-minute workshop with third year medical students that focused on promoting awareness of GB and SH including a gender privilege walk and a discussion of the root causes of gender bias and sexual harassment. Students were also introduced to the bystander approach and the reality that gender bias, harassment and violence are everyone's problem to solve. Students then broke into small groups to discuss cases from actual learner experiences. Our workshop concluded by providing the medical students with strategies to empower all genders to respond to inequities that they observe. A survey was issued to the students immediately following the workshop, as well as at the end of the year to assess long-term impact. Summary of results Third year medical students who participated in our curriculum showed a significant and sustainable improvement, compared to before the workshop, in their knowledge of gender bias and sexual harassment (p=0.001) as well as their ability to confront these issues in the learning environment when they personally experience GB/SH themselves (p=0.001) or when they witness GB/SH (p=<0.0001). Students also reported feelings of validation, awareness and empowerment as well as appreciation for the process of information sharing, faculty facilitation, and practical techniques gained from the workshop. Conclusions Our study suggests that students exposed to a 120-minute workshop are better equipped to recognize and respond to GB/SH.

Achieving Gender and Social Equality: More Than Gender Parity Is Needed,Raj A.; ; Kumra T.; Darmstadt G.L.; Freund K.M.,"In this Perspective, the authors review Association of American Medical Colleges data on gender parity and intersectionality, consider the literature on gender parity in academic medicine and the underlying gender norms that explain these statistics, and offer recommendations for moving past indicators of parity to achieve gender and social equality.Improvements in gender parity among medical school graduates have not translated to gender parity among practicing physicians or medical school faculty, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities. Further, gender parity does not correspond to gender equality, such that gender-based disparities in salaries and advancement persist. In addition, social norms related to traditional gender role expectations reinforce existing biases and lead to sexual harassment and discrimination against women in the workplace.Building on their analysis of existing data and the literature, the authors offer concrete recommendations to achieve gender equality in academic medicine that not only improve parity but also support policies and practices to address the norms that further bias and discrimination. These recommendations include the collection, monitoring, and open reporting of data on salaries as well as on sex and race/ethnicity; stronger policies related to family leave and sexual discrimination and harassment; and accountability structures to ensure that policies are enforced.

Sex and gender bias in the experimental neurosciences: the case of the maternal immune activation model,Coiro P.; ; Pollak D.D.,"Recent and rapidly developing movements relating to the increasing awareness and reports of gender bias, discrimination, and abuse have reached the academic environments. The consideration that negative attitudes toward women and abuse of power creates a hostile environment for female scientists, facilitating sexual harassment and driving women out of science, can be easily related to. Rationally inaccessible gender biases are not only evident at the level of the researchers, but are also paralleled by a corresponding imbalance at the level of the research subjects. Here, we focus on the maternal immune activation (MIA) animal model to illustrate exemplarily the current state of ex-/inclusion of female research subjects and the consideration of sex as biological variable in the basic neurosciences. We demonstrate a strong sex disparity with a major emphasis on male animals in studies examining behavioral and neurochemical alterations in MIA offspring. We put forward the hypothesis that this neglect of female subjects in basic research may stem from a hard-wired sex/gender bias, which may also be reflected in a similar attitude toward female scientists. We suggest exploring the possibility that by dismantling sex bias and male dominance in basic research one would get an additional handle on favorably modifying the perception and appreciation for women in science.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019, The Author(s).",2019,/,Translational Psychiatry,9,1,90,626389974,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-019-0423-8,30765690,#309,Coiro 2019,"",""
"""Yes, I'm the Doctor"": One Department's Approach to Assessing and Addressing Gender-Based Discrimination in the Modern Medical Training Era",McKinley S.K.; ; Wang L.J.; Gartland R.M.; Westfal M.L.; Costantino C.L.; Schwartz D.; Merrill A.L.; Petrusa E.; Lillemoe K.; Phitayakorn R.,"While gender-based bias and discrimination (GBD) is known to exist in medical training, there is limited guidance for training programs on how to understand and combat this issue locally. The Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Surgery established the Gender Equity Task Force (GETF) to address GBD in the local training environment. In 2017, members of the GETF surveyed residents in surgery, anesthesia, and internal medicine at 2 academic hospitals to better understand perceived sources, frequency, forms, and effects of GBD. Overall, 371 residents completed the survey (60% response rate, 197 women). Women trainees were more likely to endorse personal experience of GBD and sexual harassment than men (P < .0001), with no effect of specialty on rates of GBD or sexual harassment. Patients and nursing staff were the most frequently identified groups as sources of GBD. While an overwhelming majority of both men (86%) and women (96%) respondents either experienced or observed GBD in the training environment, less than 5% of respondents formally reported such experiences, most frequently citing a belief that nothing would happen. Survey results served as the basis for a variety of interventions addressing nursing staff and patients as sources of GBD, low confidence in formal reporting mechanisms, and the pervasiveness of GBD, including sexual harassment, across specialties.

From the #metoo frontlines: Incoming interns report a breadth of experiences related to sexual harassment in medical school,Yecies E.B.; ; McNeil M.,"Background: The prevalence of sexual harassment in medicine has recently been in the spotlight, with up to 30% of female physicians reporting sexual harassment in the workplace. There is also increasing recognition that the spectrum of sex discrimination includes microaggressions, the prevalence of which have yet to be elucidated Medical students are a particularly vulnerable population within medicine as they experience the widest power differentials and their ongoing grades and evaluations deepen the consequences of retaliation to reporting. With the influence of the #metoo movement, a few medical school deans have seen an increase in reporting, but most schools report stagnant (and low) reporting rates, indicating that sexual harassment may still be under-represented in the current reporting system. We aimed to study the ways in which medical students experienced sexual harassment in medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An in-person cross-sectional survey was administered to incoming interns at UPMC about their experience with sexual harassment in medical school. An optional question invited respondents to share experiences of sexual harassment in free-text form.

Analysis of the responses revealed six recurring themes: (1) decision not to report, (2) unsuccessful reporting, (3) disproportionate "" scut"" work for female students, (4) inappropriate comments and touching, (5) repeat offenders with well-known reputations, and (6) male patients harassing female students. This last theme was particularly attributed to Veterans Administration (VA) patients. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): More female students than male students shared negative experiences. They identified a breadth of experiences attributed to both colleagues/superiors and patients. Most importantly, many students identified the current reporting system as discouraging of reporting.

3.69 SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION DURING MEDICAL RESIDENCE IN MEXICO,Guizar-Sanchez D.; ; Huicochea I.V.; Fresan Orellana A.; Heinze G.,"Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to assess the prevalence of sexual violence (SV) and gender discrimination (GD) among residents in Mexico. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted at the faculty of medicine of National University of Mexico (UNAM), from August 20 to 27, 2018. It was approved by the ethics committee. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 5041 medical residents (from 60 different specialization courses) were evaluated. Among those residents, 51 percent (n = 2578) were female, with an average age of 30.62 years (SD = 2.94); the majority were enrolled in the first and second years of the specialty (n = 1689, 33.5% and n = 2610, 51.8%, respectively), in a public institution (n = 4650, 92.2%). At least 1 type of SV and GD was reported by 83.6 percent of the sample group. Bivariate analysis revealed an association between SV and GD with female sex (p = 0.03 and p = 0.002, respectively), not having a partner (p = 0.04), during the second year of training (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively) and during a surgical specialty (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In the final multivariate model, the variables were strongly associated with SV and GD: second-year training (OR 2.78, p = 0.01 and OR 3.11, p = 0.04, respectively) and surgical specialty (OR 5.69, p = 0.03 and OR 4.23, p = 0.01, respectively). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A healthy and secure learning environment is essential for optimal medical training. Harassment has a negative effect on residents' health and on their ability to function. No previous study has documented the prevalence of SV and GD among residents in Mexico. SV and GD of Mexican residents are common, with more than three-fourths of the residents reporting having had such an experience. Identification of the risk factors is a necessary first step in clarifying this issue and could be used when planning strategies for prevention. Redressing sexual inequalities in medicine will require more than increasing the numbers of women in male-dominated specialties. The changing roles of the sexes in society, learning styles, hospital-based training, and the professional identities of women in a largely masculine medical hierarchy are all deeply relevant.

Does gender bias still affect women in science?,Roper R.L.; ,"The percentage of women employed in professional scientific positions has been low but is increasing over time. The U.S. National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have both implemented programs to improve women's participation in science, and many universities and companies have diversity and equity programs. While most faculty and scientists believe that they are fair and unbiased, numerous well-designed studies published in leading peer-reviewed journals show that gender bias in sciences and medicine is widespread and persistent today in both faculty and students. Recent studies show that gender bias affects student grading, professional hiring, mentoring, tenure, promotion, respect, grant proposal success, and pay. In addition, sexual harassment remains a significant barrier. Fortunately, several studies provide evidence that programs that raise conscious awareness of gender bias can improve equity in science, and there are a number of recommendations and strategies for improving the participation of women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

Understanding and addressing gender equity for women in neurology,Silver J.K.; ,"Despite the fact that the percentages of women among physicians and neurologists have been rising, gender-related disparities in numerous metrics persist, notably in compensation, promotion, funding, recognition, leadership, publishing, and speaking. Simultaneously, women working in academia, including medicine, face high rates of sexual harassment. Leaders of all health care-related organizations must accept the moral and ethical imperative to expeditiously address both gender-related discrimination and harassment (inclusive of but not limited to sexual harassment) of women in medicine. At this unique time in history, there is an opportunity for leaders in neurology to strategically accelerate efforts to address workforce gender disparities and ensure harassment-free training and work environments. Leaders will have to plan an intentional path forward, using a systematic process, metrics, and strategies unique to their own organizations, to overcome barriers to an equitable and safe work environment for women. Moreover, leaders in 4 gatekeeper organizations - medical schools/academic medical centers, funding agencies, journals, and medical societies - must hold each other accountable for gender equity as their own success and financial return on investment is dependent on the efforts of those in the other categories.

Gender Equity and Career Advancement: Implications for Hospice and Palliative Medicine (TH352),Johnson K.S.; ; O'Mahony S.; Chen H.; Hingle S.; Moyer D.,"Objectives: *Describe disparities in the experience of female physicians compared to their male counterparts.*Describe specific challenges more commonly faced by female physicians and potential consequences with case examples.*Illustrate strategies for addressing gender disparities and promoting gender equity. Over the last 25 years, the proportion of physicians who are women has doubled from 17% to 36%. Furthermore, 46% of physicians in training and over half of U.S. medical students are women. While this significant increase in gender diversity has rapidly changed what the physician work force ""looks like"", there is a significant and persistent gap in the experience of female physicians. Compared to their male counterparts, studies show that female physicians are paid less across specialties and are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positons despite their increasing representation in the physician workforce. Women may also experience lack of mentorship, workplace discrimination, gender bias, sexual harassment and challenges related to work-life integration based on their roles outside of the workplace. While gender equity is a salient issue across all specialties, efforts to improve the experience of women are especially important to the field of hospice and palliative medicine where women make up two-thirds of the total workforce, 47% of physicians, and over 60% of HPM fellows in training-proportions considerably larger than in general physician workforce. Given the important contribution of women to the field of hospice and palliative medicine not only in terms of the volume of clinical care provided but also related to leadership, education, and research, addressing gender equity is essential to efforts to ensure that the field is able to meet the demands of the growing population of seriously ill patients and their families.

Moreover, gender disparities have persisted in medicine, despite over half of U.S. physicians under age 44 being female. The purpose of this study is to evaluate perceived gender biases, prevalence of sexual harassment, and how these affect physician growth and advancement in gynecologic oncology (Gyn-Onc). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a survey study of U.S.-based physician members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology: full, senior, and fellow members. Participants reported: demographics; experiences with sexual harassment in training/practice; perceptions of gender disparities in Gyn-Onc. Survey was anonymized and collected using RedCap data capture tool. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The survey was sent to 1,566 members; 402 responses were received (26% response rate: 255 females (F), 147 males (M)). Female responders were younger, non-white (28% F, 11% M), not married (16% F, 3% M), and had fewer years in practice than males (p<=0.001, each). Six of every 10 responders (64%) reported experiencing sexual harassment during training/practice; 7 of every 10 women (71%) experienced sexual harassment in training/practice. One in 10 responders openly reported this behavior (15% responders; 17%F, 10% M, p=0.210); most common reasons for lack of reporting were: incident did not seem important enough (40%), did not think anything would be done about it (37%), and fear of reprisal (34%).

Career consequences for medical students experiencing sexual harassment,Yecies E.B.; ; McNeil M.,"Background: Recent studies have demonstrated the high prevalence of sexual harassment in medicine, with 30% of female physicians and over 15% of medical students endorsing sexual harassment. There is also increasing recognition that the spectrum of sex discrimination includes microaggressions. However, it remains unclear what consequences sexual harassment has on the attitudes and career trajectories of women in the field of medicine. We aimed to identify the effect of sexual harassment on student attitudes towards medicine and specialty choices. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An in-person cross-sectional survey was administered to incoming interns at UPMC about their experience with sexual harassment in medical school. The survey was adapted from a previously-published validated instrument (Sexist MESS) and included questions about attitudes following the experience of sexual harassment.

Interns represented the full spectrum of specialties and graduated from medical schools across the country. 92 respondents identified as female, and 90 as male. The statement "" Negative experiences related to my gender caused me to feel bad about coming to work"" yielded answers of agree or strongly agree in 8.7% of women and 2.2% of men. 8.7% of women and 0% of men agreed with "" Negative experiences related to my gender caused me to doubt my choice of medicine as a profession."" 10.9% of women and 2.2% of men agreed with "" Negative experiences related to my gender contributed to changing the specialty I pursued"" (p< 0.001 for all).

Perceptions of Sexual Harassment in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Training and Practice,Zurayk L.; ; Cheng K.; Zemplenyi M.; Burke A.B.; Dillon J.K.,"Despite increased awareness of sexually harassing behaviors (SHB) in the past decade and national movements such as #MeToo, SHB continues to be a pervasive problem for women training in medical and surgical fields [1]. Although there have been reports of SHB in surgical residency training programs, none have focused on oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). Specifically, there are no previous reports examining prevention or effects of SHB on female OMSs. The aims of this study are to: 1) Determine the prevalence and nature of SHB in a subset of female OMS residents and practicing surgeons in the United States, 2) study the subjective effects of SHB on the professional development of female OMSs, and 3) examine the role of SHB education in training institutions and its effect on prevalence rates. An IRB-exempt, cross-sectional study was conducted, adapted from the validated Sexual Experiences Questionnaire [2]. This 22-question survey was emailed to female members of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Women's Clinical Interest Group. Questions focused on perceived personal experiences of SHB, including gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion. Participants confidentially reported the effects on their educational experience and career satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were computed. Statistical significance was set at P <.05. Surveys were emailed to 89 participants and 67 were completed for a response rate of 75%. Fifty-three (79%) were practicing OMS, the most common age range group was 35-44 (41%). Fourteen (21%) were OMS residents between 25-34 years. Ninety-six percent of individuals experienced at least 1 instance of gender harassment; 52% experienced unwanted sexual attention, and 9% experienced sexual coercion. Of respondents that experienced any kind of SHB, 60% reported these experiences occurred during residency, and 30% reported SHB after residency. The instigator of SHB was most commonly a co-resident (43%). Professors and patients were equally cited as instigators at 31%. Forty-six percent of respondents said SHB ""created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment"" and 42% reported it had a ""negative effect on my confidence in myself as professional."" The ""habitual telling of suggestive stories or offensive jokes"" was associated with creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment (P =.02). Sixty-seven percent of those that experienced SHB did not feel comfortable reporting the behavior, noting: ""I considered that reporting abuse would become more troublesome than it was worth"" as the most frequently cited reason (54%). Sixty-one percent of respondents did not receive any education on SHB during training, with those over 35 years less likely to receive education (P =.001). Lack of SHB education was associated with the perception of being treated ""differently because of your sex"" (P =.01). In conclusion, SHB among female OMS has a high prevalence. Despite the limited sample size, our findings suggest a hostile environment created by SHB erodes the personal confidence and career development of female OMS practitioners and residents. While the most frequently identified instigators are co-residents and professors, we recommend educational training for all residents, faculty, and staff on SHB to ensure personal/academic growth in a safe environment. By examining prevalence and self-reported effects of SHB, training programs can shift the culture, opening up discourse on SHB visibility, accountability, and advocacy. References: 1.

Support structures for female physicians: Motivations and barriers to gender-specific conferences and symposia,Jain S.; ; Graff S.L.; Swaroop M.; Woitowich N.C.,"Background: While nearly half of all medical school graduates are female, women remain underrepresented in the physician workforce. Conferences or symposia designed to address issues relevant to female physicians, such as gender-bias, sexual harassment, and work-life balance are one strategy to improve retention and advancement, yet, limited data exists surrounding their utility. To address this gap, we surveyed a multi-disciplinary group of female physicians to identify motivations or barriers to attendance. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An online survey instrument was distributed nationally via social media and shared by respondents. The survey assessed participants' demographics, attendance at genderspecific conferences or symposia, motivations or barriers to attendance, and perceived benefits of attendance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 792 respondents, 34% had attended a conference or symposia for women in medicine, while 66% had not.

Non-attendees were significantly more likely to be the primary caregiver for children or seniors (64% vs. 56%, p = 0.042). Respondents indicated that an interest in discussion topics, a sense of community, and growth of professional network were key motivators in attendance. The majority of respondents indicated that attendance improved their self-advocacy, self-image, and leadership skills. Of those who did not attend, 5 1% were unaware of such conferences or symposia. Those who were aware, but unable to attend, cited lack of time as the major barrier to participation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results of this study provide preliminary data surrounding gender-specific conferences or symposia for women in medicine and highlight opportunities for increased engagement.

Mistreatment by patients: A pilot curriculum based on resident experiences,Namboodiri S.; ; Campbell T.; Chan C.,"Needs and Objectives: Mistreatment of physicians by patients is a problem that contributes to burnout. Few educational curricula address this issue for physicians in training. This pilot project sought to characterize resident mistreatment by patients at a Veterans Affairs (VA) and an affiliated university (non-VA) hospital and develop a novel curriculum that provides tools to handle mistreatment. Setting and Participants: One 60-minute session was held as a noon conference for PGY 1-3 internal medicine (IM) residents in two settings: VA and non-VA. VA attendees were n = 10 (male = 5, female = 5). Non-VA attendees were n = 16 (male = 12, female = 4). Two IM physician educators were facilitators. Description: Curriculum development was informed by VA residents' experiences with mistreatment. VA residents (n=20) were asked about the prevalence, type, perpetrators and effects of mistreatment; based on this data, we developed an interactive, case-based curriculum related to mistreatment by patients with the following Learning Objectives: 1.Define resident mistreatment 2.Review the prevalence and forms of mistreatment 3.Discuss approaches to mistreatment by patients as a victim and bystander. Cases included unwanted sexual behavior, racial discrimination, and gender harassment. At the VA, large group discussions required residents to demonstrate use of tools from the literature to approach cases. Due to some attendees' reticence to speak out in this format, the non-VA residents were divided into small groups for case studies, which enhanced open discussions. We developed minute papers for pre-and post-sessions; Likert scales were used to determine mistreatment frequency and comfort level with response to mistreatment. Evaluation: Mistreatment frequency differed between settings: 70% of VA residents experienced mistreatment frequently or often and 30% experienced it sometimes, while 33% of non-VA residents experienced it sometimes or often and 67% only rarely or never. Pre-session, 70% of VA residents felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with their response to mistreatment while only 0-1% of non-VA residents felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable. Post-session, 90% of residents at both sites felt comfortable or very comfortable handling mistreatment. Residents at both sites were very satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the presentations. The most helpful aspects were tools reviewed in the session for VA residents and the small group discussions for non-VA residents. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Results suggest that IM residents were more likely to experience mistreatment by patients in VA compared to non-VA settings. This could be due to a growing mistrust of the VA by veterans or the disinhibitory effect of increasingly racist and sexist politics on the largely male veteran population. However, a lack of gender balance in the non-VA group may have led to lower responses. The high satisfaction levels post-session in both settings suggest that the curriculum was beneficial.

"Eliminating Gender-Based Bias in Academic Medicine: More Than Naming the ""Elephant in the Room""",Morgan A.U.; ; Chaiyachati K.H.; Weissman G.E.; Liao J.M.,"Gender-based discrimination and bias are widespread in professional settings, including academic medicine.

Barriers to progress vary across institutions and include lack of awareness, inadequate training, poor informational transparency, and challenging power dynamics. We propose five solutions that the academic medical community can adopt to not only name, but also address, gender-based bias as the proverbial elephant in the room: definitively identify the systemic nature of the problem, prompt those with influence and power to advance a culture of equity, broadly incorporate evidence-based explicit anti-sexist training, increase transparency of information related to professional development and compensation, and use robust research methods to study the drivers and potential solutions of gender inequity within academic medicine.

Airing the dirty laundry of medical practice on the comedy television show scrubs: Reality television discussing the real issues in medicine,Bryan Y.F.; ; Kostelic P.; McLaughlin D.H.; Keenan R.,"INTRODUCTION: Medical practice and physicians have been portrayed on television and in movies with a variety of character traits in dramatic roles1. From attractive surgeons with great bedside manner in Grey's Anatomy to an unconventional, drug addicted teaching physician, as seen in 'House' 2. The publics' perception toward healthcare professionals may be affected by negative TV portrayals. 'Scrubs' was a medical comedy-drama that aired on television and was narrated through the daydreams of main character a medical intern named, Dr. John 'J.D.' Dorian2. Although comedy may not be seen as realistic as drama or documentaries, the issues presented may be as important or more controversial and thus harder to discuss between medical students and attending physicians. We sought to examine the portrayal of medical practice and physicians and issues related to professionalism, patient-physician interactions in a medical show focused on comedy and satire. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): The rst 12 episodes of season 1 of 'Scrubs' were watched on Netflix, which originally aired from October 2, 2001 to January 8, 2002. The twelve episodes were viewed by a pre-medical student, two medical students, and an attending anesthesiologist. Four main themes were identified and then further sub-categorized into sections related to the following; professionalism, medical education, patient interaction, and physician empathy enthusiasm. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): The 12 episodes of season 1 showed a unique portrayal of medical practice and of the day-to-day lives of multiple medical professionals as it related to professionalism, medical education, patient-physician interaction, and physician empathy/enthusiasm (or lack there-of). (Tables 1-3) <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Although the show was overtly satirical, it displayed multiple themes that still exist in every-day, real-life medicine. Several young medical interns were forced to balance their good medical care with the demand of pleasing their superiors and having professional interpersonal relationships. Many examples of improper professionalism such as rude comments between coworkers, belittling and bullying of subordinates and an attending ignoring an employee's sexual harassment claim. Many sexually inappropriate behaviors occurred including coworkers engaging in sexual intercourse and rendering sexually provocative and inappropriate statements to each other while at work. A recent study found that when female healthcare workers were asked about their experiences with gender bias, inappropriate sexual comments, and bribery for sexual acts, approximately a third of them had experienced sexual harassment3. A large percentage of women also reported that the sexual harassment had a negative impact on their careers3. While it may be portrayed as a comedy on the show, this may indicate an underlying problem in medicine. Television shows, especially comedies, however may provide a unique way by which to bring up controversial topics and these portrayals may indicate pieces of reality that may be used to mentor future physicians.",2018,/,Anesthesia and Analgesia,126,4 Supplement 1,222EP  - 224,626089312,,,#325,Bryan 2018,"",""
Bullying and Sexual Discrimination in the Greek Health Care System,Chrysafi P.; ; Simou E.; Makris M.; Malietzis G.; Makris G.C.,"Introduction Modern medicine is based on teamwork and communication. Bullying and discrimination can have a serious effect on these, affecting the standard of medical training and patient care. Aim To determine the incidence of bullying and sex discrimination in the Greek health care system. Methods An online questionnaire was designed and circulated among Greek medical professionals. Results We received 1349 completed questionnaires with a response rate of 48% and with 45% of them being female. Equal opportunities in specialty training were reported by 55% of the participants. Female doctors in medicine and in surgery reported no equal opportunities at an incidence of 15% and 30%, respectively (p < 0.001). Family obligations and lack of family support were considered as the main obstacles in female doctors' professional development by 92% and 59% of the participants, respectively. Both sexes appeared to have suffered from various forms of abusive behavior with characteristics that vary between them. Verbal abuse, threatening behavior, and sexual harassment were reported by 50%, 38%, and 20%, respectively, with women being 3 times more likely to be victims of sexual harassment (34% vs. 9%, p < 0.001). Finally, the availability of official support mechanisms was reported in only 15% of the cases, whereas friends and colleagues were the main support for 46.17% of the cases. Conclusion This is the first study attempting to preliminary describe the extent of bullying and sexual discrimination in the Greek national health care system.

Marmara university medical students' perception on sexual violence against women and induced abortion in Turkey,Luleci N.E.; ; Kaya E.; Aslan E.; Soylem Senkal E.; Cicek Z.N.,"Background: Historically, sexual assault is a common issue in Turkey. As doctors are one of the steps to help sexually assaulted women, medical students should have basic knowledge of and sensitivity regarding this subject. Another common women's public health issue is induced abortion. In countries where access to abortion is restricted, there is a tendency towards unhealthy abortion. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the attitudes and opinions of Marmara University Medical Faculty students about sexual assault against women and induced abortion and (2) to propose an educational program for medical students about sexual assault and abortion. <ovid:br/>Study Design: Cross-sectional study. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The questionnaires were self-administered and the data were analyzed using SPSS v.15.0. First, the descriptive statistics were analyzed, followed by Chi-square for contingency tests assessing differences in attitudes toward sexual assault and induced abortion by factors such as gender and educational term. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): About 89.6% of the participants (n=266) reported that they had never been sexually assaulted and about 11.5% of the women (n=19) had been sexually assaulted. There was no significant relationship between previous sexual assault and gender (p>0.05). Although there was no significant difference regarding the extent of punishment by victim's status as a virgin, 21.3% (n=63) agreed that punishment should be more severe when the victim was a virgin. About 40.7% (n=120) agreed that the legal period of abortion in Turkey (10 weeks) should be longer.

GENDERED MEDICINE: A STUDY AMONG MEDICAL EDUCATORS IN MAHARASHTRA,John P.; ,"Background Health is often predicated on social structures with prescriptive gender identities and associated power relations. Gender hierarchies create differences between men, women and transgender persons in terms of their exposure to health risk factors, access to health care, care received in facilities and consequences of ill health. Critiques of medical curricula in India have highlighted many lapses in the inclusion of social determinants of health in medical education. Medical education was found to be especially divorced from the gender perspective while at its worst, gender biases were actively promoted in medical textbooks used for teaching. Methods A qualitative study on the status of medical education from a gender perspective was carried out in seven medical colleges in Maharashtra. In-depth interviews of 60 medical educators were undertaken. The selection of the study respondents was purposive: the respondents were faculty members from five departments viz. Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Preventive and Social Medicine, Psychiatry and Medicine. Data analysis was done with the help of QDA software package Atlas.ti 6.2. Findings The terms 'sex' and 'gender' were used interchangeably by the respondents. The articulations of the respondents regarding gender were centred on anatomical differences between men and women, sex-specific diseases and violence against women. There was also a consistent view among the educators that the topic of 'social determinants of health' belonged solely within the purview of the Preventive and Social Medicine syllabus. There was resistance to the inclusion of social determinants in medicine. The linkages between medicine and social determinants were not clearly identified or articulated by the respondents. The respondents held insensitive and prejudiced views with regard to issues related to sexual harassment, sexuality, genderbased discrimination and the gendered nature of medical institutions. For instance, psychiatry professors continued to use the term 'hysteria' to describe depressive or anxiety disorders among women. Gender stereotypes regarding patients were very common. Male patients were seen to be more forthcoming and more precise in their complaints than female patients. The educators held many misconceptions and assumptions associated with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act and Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act. In the educators view, abortion services were either conditional or simply to be denied to women with two daughters and to women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Conditions such as filing a medico-legal case or undergoing sterilisation found root in the doctors' fear that demand for abortion was a result of sex determination. Through conditional MTPs, the doctors safeguarded themselves from any liability under the PCPNDT Act. In protecting themselves from harm the doctors coerced women to one of the following: [a] continue with an unwanted pregnancy; [b] undergo sterilisation; [c] adopt an intrauterine contraceptive device; or [d] file a medico-legal case. Discussion The integration of gender in medical education is imperative in order to sensitise future health professionals to gender inequity and its interaction with health. The introduction of gender at different levels in the medical curriculum could pave the way for an opening up of medicine to social realities of how signifiers such as class, caste and gender have a bearing on health. This in turn could have far-reaching effects on how diagnosis and treatment is carried out in medical practice. This may also compel clinicians to acknowledge alternative ways of approaching health and medicine. The centrality of the biomedical approach in medicine could then undergo a much needed revision. Furthermore, a marked improvement in the doctor-patient relationship can be envisaged, wherein the doctor takes a multidimensional approach to understanding the concerns of the patient. In case s/he is unable to address a problem in its entirety, then s/he identifies mechanisms, institutions or other professionals who can be of assistance to the patient. This would allow for more frequent and improved interaction between departments in medical colleges and health facilities. Ultimately, a comprehensive/ holistic approach, with greater gender sensitivity in dealing with health concerns, can be achieved through a deeper engagement with gender issues by medical educators and students.",2016,/,BMJ Global Health,1,Supplement 1,A37EP  - A38,638543498,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2016-EPHPabstracts.50,,#328,John 2016,"",""
Sexual harassment in the medical profession: Legal and ethical responsibilities,Mathews B.; ; Bismark M.M.,"Sexual harassment of women in medicine has become a subject of national debate after a senior female surgeon stated that if a woman complained of unwanted advances her career would be jeopardised, and subsequent reports suggest that sexual harassment is a serious problem in the medical profession. Sexual harassment of women in the medical profession by their colleagues presents substantial legal, ethical and cultural questions for the profession. Women have enforceable legal rights to gender equality and freedom from sexual harassment in the workplace. Both individual offenders and employers face significant legal consequences for sexual harassment in every Australian state and territory, and individual medical practitioners and employers need to understand their legal and ethical rights and responsibilities in this context. An individual offender may be personally liable for criminal offences, and for breaching antidiscrimination legislation, duties owed in civil law, professional standards and codes of conduct. An employer may be liable for breaching antidiscrimination legislation, workplace safety laws, duties owed in contract law, and a duty of care owed to the employee. Employers, professional colleges and associations, and regulators should use this national debate as an opportunity to improve gender equality and professional culture in medicine; individuals and employers have clear legal and ethical obligations to minimise sexual harassment to the greatest extent possible.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 AMPCo Pty Ltd.

Behavioral assessment of child sexual abuse victims attending a child psychiatry clinic in Samsun/ Turkey after a traumatic event,Usta M.B.; ; Aral A.; Akbas S.; Aydin B.,"Objective: Child Sexual Abuse(CSA), which damages psychological and physical health and has negative effects on development, is a serious public health problem in the world. Several studies have shown that a number of psychiatric disorders may develop, such as behavioral problems, compromised interpersonal relations, sexually oriented behavior, engagement in high-risk activities, substance dependence, suicidal thoughts or behavior, personality disorders, depression, dissociation, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thus, there is strong evidence that CSA-related PTSD have a profound and often lasting impact that can encompass psychological health, neurobiological development, relational skills, and risk behaviors. In this study, we aimed to extend our understanding of consequences of sexual traumas and trauma-related emotional and behavioral problems with a detailed psychiatric examination and assessment with Youth Self-Report (YSR) of CSA victims after a traumatic event. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Victims said by judicial authorities to have been subjected to sexual abuse are referred to the Ondokuzmayis University Faculty of Medicine Forensic Medicine Department for examination and reports establish the severity of the physical and psychiatric damage resulting from such sexual abuse. 160 cases under the age of 18, referred for this purpose from several provinces of Turkey between January 01, 2007 and December 31, 2013, were included in the study and their patient files examined. We used a Turkish version of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) as screening instrument in the first stage. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sociodemographic findings: CSA victims were 15.3+/-1.9 years old on average, and 87.5% were female.

Cortical gray matter variations in young women at high risk for familial depression and their depressed mothers with (positive) family history,Ozalay O.; ; Nazli I.P.; Tunay S.; Simsek F.; Aksoy B.; Kizilates G.; Hepdurgun C.; Kitis O.; Saffet Gonul A.,"INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, which leads to significant social and economic burden across the world. One way to increase knowledge about pathophysiology is to understand how the pre-disease state processes to the disease state. The pre-disease state can be best studied in the high-risk populations who have higher chance of proceeding to disease. First degree relatives especially the offspring of patients are accepted as high-risk groups. Researchers were able to observe structural and functional abnormalities in the high-risk groups. Miskowiak et al observed increased anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortexes, pre-supplementary motor area with parietooccipital areas activation to happy or fearful faces in healthy twins with a co-twin history of depression1. On the other hand, Chen et al reported reduced hippocampal volume in girls of depressed mothers2. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the cortical grey matter volume alterations in young women who were at risk for familial depression. The secondary aim was to perceive if those alterations were parallel with their MDD diagnosed mothers. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Subjects: After approval by the Ethics Committee of Ege University and the recruitment via Internet advertisements and by invitation from the hospital database between 2009-2013, we screened 53 pairs of depressed mothers with their daughters. Among these pairs, 24 women with the diagnosis of MDD with recurrent episodes (mean age: 46.2+/-3.9 years) and their healthy daughters (the high-risk for familial depression group; HRFD) aged between 18-26 (mean age: 22.3+/-2.1 years) were included. The recurrent MDD diagnoses weremconfirmed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-4 (SCID). iInclusion criteria for the MDD mothers were; being free from clinically significant depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)<16), having no other axis I diagnoses, having at least one healthy daughter with no history of depression between the ages 18-25, having a first-degree relative with an MDD diagnosis, having no history of psychotic symptoms. Patients with chronic medical illness and those who had relatives with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia were excluded. The control group was composed of age similar 24 healthy mothers (mean age: 47.3+/-5.6 years) who had healthy daughters of similar ages (mean age: 22.1+/-2.1 years) to the high-risk group. The healthy daughters of the control group constituted the low-risk for familial depression group (LRFD). Exclusion criteria for control groups were; any current or past psychiatric disorder confirmed with SCID, having any first-degree relative diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, having a chronic medical illness, having significant childhood trauma (e.g. sexual or physical abuse). Mothers and daughters gave their written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the study's purpose and procedures. Mothers in the MDD group continued their ongoing treatment and no treatment modification was done for this study. Depressive symptoms were assessed by HAM-D and Beck Depression rating scales on the same week for MRI scan. MRI Acquisition: 3D T1 weighted, sagittal, magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans of the head, 2D T2 weighted axial, Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) scans of the whole brain and 3D coronal fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Verio, Numaris/4, Syngo MR B17, 3T MR scanner. TSE and FLAIR scans were used for clinical evaluation and MPRAGE scans were used in the region of interest (ROI) analysis. Image Processing: For image processing we used FreeSurfer Software and it's recommended mainstream pipeline to segment gray matter volumes. Statistics: Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by t- or chi-square tests for MDD vs Controls and HRFD vs LRFD separately. Analyses of co-variance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the grey matter volume in each ROI. Total Intracranial Volume (ICV) was accepted nuisance variable for ANCOVA analyses. Due to multiple comparisons, we reported both uncorrected and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p values adjusted to 0.05. The correlation between grey matter volumes in ROIs with clinical parameters were assessed by Pearson correlation test. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Sociodemographic and Clinical Variables: There were no differences in age or education status among the MDD vs controls and HRFD vs LRFD. We observed higher Beck and HAM-D scores not only in MDD but also in the HRFD compared to controls and LRFD. Neuroimaging Variables: We observed greater grey matter volumes in right anterior cingulate and entorhinal cortexes in HRFD compared to LRFD. The difference in the right anterior cingulate cortex was preserved after FDR correction. We observed smaller ICV in the control group compared to MDD (t=3.2 df=46 p<0.01). ANCOVA relieved that MDD had greater grey matter volume in left inferior frontal cortex. However, this difference was disappeared after FDR correction. There were no correlation between any of the clinical variables and the GM values obtained from ROIs. <ovid:br/>DISCUSSION(S): This study investigated the cortical GMV of a group of young women who were at risk for familial depression and was able to confirm altered GMV in the right anterior cingulate and entorhinal cortex in this population. Our secondary aim of comparing GMV alterations observed in HRFD with their depressed mothers was partially reached because of weak differences between MDD and control groups. Despite our expectations, we found increased GMV in MDD group at left inferior frontal cortex, which was lost with multiple comparisons correction. The most prominent finding of this study is increased GMV at the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in HRFD while there was no volume alteration in the depressed mothers. ACC has connections with various brain areas including limbic system and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These two regions with ACC have significant role in executing working memory, language, attention, and information processing and affect regulation. It is well known that those cognitive functions and affect regulation are impaired in depressive patients. Therefore, it is thought that ACC is one of the major dysfunctional areas in MDD. While the functional neuroimaging studies have consistently supported dysfunctional ACC in MDD patients, such consistency has not emerged from the studies using structural neuroimaging methodology. One study investigated the rostral ACC in healthy children with depressed mood and found significant reduction only in male children3. In a three generation study, Peterson et al showed cortical thinning in the lateral surface of right hemisphere while thickening in the subgenual, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex4. With the current non-depressed status of HRFD group, our findings of increased GMV in ACC and entorhinal cortex -which were absent in their depressed mothers- might be related to resilience to depression. We also observed increased GMV in the right entorhinal cortex of HRFD group, which is the main interface between neocortex and hippocampus. It plays an important role in memory formation and consolidation that are impaired in MDD. It has been proposed that volumetric alterations in entorhinal cortex lead to impairment of the cortical-hippocampal circuit and that these structural changes have been implicated in the etiology of depression We found no major GMV difference between MDD and healthy controls in selected brain regions. In this study, we used ROI based approach that gives the mean values of the whole GMV in the selected regions and smaller local alteration might be missed by this method. Despite this disadvantage of ROI approach, it has advantages of better registration over voxel-based approach. It should be kept in mind that we investigated certain areas of brain to test our hypothesis. Therefore, it would be premature to conclude that there is no regional GMV differences between MDD and controls. One strength of this study is to include the mothers and their daughters as couples in both arm of the comparison. On the other hand, the main limitation was small subject number in each group. Obtaining our data from female subjects also limits us to generalize our findings for male high-risk population. As a conclusion, we provide evidence for GMV alterations in high-risk populations for familial depression. As those regional GMV alterations were not observed in depressed mothers, these regional alterations might help the young women at risk to be depressed free. Longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to interpret the high-risk data and determine the anatomical alterations related to vulnerability and resilience to disease.",2015,/,Klinik Psikofarmakoloji Bulteni,25,SUPPL. 1,S65EP  - S67,72086689,,,#335,Ozalay 2015,"",""
A humanistic environment for dental schools: what are dental students experiencing?,Quick K.K.; ,"A Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standard now requires that dental schools commit to establishing a ""humanistic culture and learning environment"" for all members of the academic environment. The aim of this study was to identify students' perceptions of factors that affect the dental school environment and to test differences in their experiences in terms of gender and year. This picture of the existing environment was meant to serve as a first step toward creating and supporting a more humanistic academic environment. A mixed-methods approach was used for data collection during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 academic years at one U.S. dental school. Four focus groups were first conducted to explore challenges and conflicts faced by students during their dental education. A written survey informed by the focus group results was then used to obtain quantitative data. The survey response rate was 47 percent (N=188). Faculty inconsistency, cheating, and belittlement/disrespect were experienced by many of the responding dental students during their education, similar to what has been documented in medicine. These students also reported experiencing both constructive communication (90 percent) and destructive communication (up to 32 percent). The female students reported more gender discrimination and sexual harassment than their male peers, and the clinical students reported more experience with belittlement and destructive communication than the preclinical students. The results suggest that greater effort should be directed toward creating a more humanistic environment in dental schools. Based on the issues identified, steps academic institutions can take to improve these environments and student skills are outlined.",2014,/,Journal of dental education,78,12,1629EP  - 1635,603153178,,25480278,#336,Quick 2014,"",""
Barriers and Assistance for Female Leaders in Academic STEM in the US,"McCullough, L","Women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are under-represented, and women are also less likely than men to be in leadership positions, generally. Little is known about the intersection of these areas: women in leadership in STEM. To determine what sort of barriers and assistance female STEM leaders have encountered, a survey was developed asking women who are in academic leadership positions in STEM about their experiences.

"Bullying, Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and the Fear of Retaliation During Surgical Residency Training: A Systematic Review","Gianakos, AL; Freischlag, JA; Mercurio, AM; Haring, RS; LaPorte, DM; Mulcahey, MK; Cannada, LK; Kennedy, JG","Background The negative effects of bullying, discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment (BDHS) on well-being and productivity of surgical residents in training have been well documented. Despite this, little has changed over the past decade and these behaviors continue. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of each abusive behavior experienced by residents, identify the perpetrators, and examine the reporting tendency. Methods A systematic review of articles published between 2010 and 2020 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed following PRISMA guidelines. The following search terms were used: bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination, abuse, residency, surgery, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, otolaryngology, obstetrics, gynecology, urology, plastic surgery, and training. Results Twenty-five studies with 29,980 surgical residents were included. Sixty-three percent, 43, 29, and 27% of surgical residents experienced BDHS, respectively. Female residents reported experiencing all BDHS behaviors more often. Thirty-seven percent of resident respondents reported burnout, and 33% reported anxiety/depression. Attending surgeons, followed by senior co-residents, were the most common perpetrators. Seventy-one percent did not report the behavior to their institution. Fifty-one percent stated this was due to fear of retaliation. Of those who reported their experiences, 56% stated they had a negative experience reporting. Conclusion Our review demonstrates high prevalence rates of BDHS experienced by residents during surgical training, which have been associated with burnout, anxiety, and depression. The majority of residents did not report BDHS due to fear of retaliation.

Furthermore, few curricular options have been developed to discuss gender bias.Objective: To measure the prevalence of gender bias, examine qualitative differences between men and women, and create a gender bias curriculum for internal medicine residents.Methods: We surveyed 114 residents (response rate of 53.5%) to identify the prevalence and types of gender bias experienced in training. We compared estimates between genders and organized qualitative results into shared themes. We then developed a curriculum to promote and normalize discussions of gender bias.Results: Among surveyed residents, 61% reported personal experiences of gender bias during training, with 98% of women and 19% of men reporting experiences when stratified by gender. We identified two domains in which gender bias manifested: role misidentification and a difficult working environment Residents identified action items that led to the development of a gender bias curriculum. The curriculum includes didactic conferences and training sessions, a microaggression response toolkit, dinners for men and women residents, participation in a WhatsApp support group, and participation in academic projects related to gender bias in training.Conclusion: We confirmed a wide prevalence of gender bias and developed a scalable curriculum for gender bias training.

Gender Microaggression and Macroaggression Experiences of Women Athletic Trainers,"Trella, KL; Games, KE; Young, JP; Drescher, MJ; Eberman, LE","Purpose: Although gender disparities and workplace vitality for women has been studied in athletic training, gender discrimination has not been widely studied. The purpose of this study was to describe gender-based aggressions experienced by women athletic trainers (ATs) within their educational and workplace environments. Methods: We used a cross-sectional design, and the web-based survey was comprised of demographic questions, the Schedule of Sexism Events (SSE), and questions on incident reporting. The SSE asks participant to rank items on a Likert Scale (1 = the event never happened to 6 = the event happens almost all the time). Items within the SSE are contextualized to either events in the past year or events in their entire life. The survey was distributed to 5,667 women ATs through the National Athletic Training Association (NATA). Five hundred thirty-nine (539) participants accessed the survey (9.5%). Four hundred seventy-eight (478) participants (age=34.2 +/- 8.6y [range=23-66y], experience=11.0 +/- 8.2y [range=0-40y]) completed the entire instrument (88.6%). We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographic variables, gender-based education-and work-related items of the SSE and incident reporting. Results: When asked about unfair treatment while interacting with teachers, professors, or engaging in academics in their lifetime, 89% (n=425) of participants indicated they had experienced unfair treatment. Comparatively, 53% (n=252) of participants experienced unfair treatment from teachers, or professors, or while engaging in academics in the last year. When asked about unfair treatment by an employer, boss, or supervisor, 88% (n=421) of participants experienced unfair treatment in their lifetime, where 55% (n=267) have experienced unfair treatment in the past year. Ninety percent (90%, n=430) indicated they experienced unfair treatment by co-workers, fellow students, or colleagues, in their lifetime compared to 61% (n=292) in the past year. When asked if they had experienced gender-based macroaggressions and microaggressions in the workplace, 41% (n=198) experienced both types of aggressions; 5% (n=22) experienced macroaggressions and 29% (n=137) experienced microaggressions. Only 25% (n=119) of participants have reported aggressions in the workplace.

National Antarctic Program responses to fieldwork sexual harassment,"Nash, M","Sexual harassment is a common experience for women and those from other underrepresented groups in (white) male-dominated fields such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Women are especially vulnerable to sexual harassment during remote scientific fieldwork. To date, most of the limited research on fieldwork harassment has focused on individual experiences. There is an urgent need for research on organizational approaches to fieldwork sexual harassment. This study fills this gap by examining sexual harassment prevention by National Antarctic Programs. It draws on a desktop analysis of 36 National Antarctic Program websites with a focus on the current availability and quality of sexual harassment policies and procedures in expeditioner handbooks/field manuals. Findings show that very few National Antarctic Programs make their expeditioner handbooks/field manuals publicly available (n = 9), and even fewer mention sexual harassment in the documentation or describe how to lodge a complaint (n = 3). This article concludes by offering some reasons as to why National Antarctic Programs may be neglecting this issue.

"TRAUMATIC EVENTS, SEXUAL ABUSE AND MENTAL ILLNESS","Agius, M","That 'Childhood Adversity', which includes many traumatic events but in particular includes sexual abuse during childhood, can cause changes in the brain, such as the finding of a smaller hippocampus is well established by the observations of such persons as Thomas Frodl (2008, 2013). That traumatic events in adulthood can also cause both clinical symptoms such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, with equivalent shrinkage of the hippocampus (Smith 2005), is also well known. In this article we apply these neurological findings to the particular traumatic event of sexual abuse at any age, first to demonstrate that such abuse can indeed cause a number of mental illnesses, and hence to produce a model of how different forms of mental trauma may cause different mental illnesses. Next we describe human sexuality as a form of language, whereby feelings ranging from love to indifference to exercise of power to hatred can be expressed. We suggest that the expression of these feelings can give rise to positive feelings or to the mental illnesses we have mentioned. We emphasize how free choice is central to the 'messages' that we give to our partners through our sexuality -and therefore that we are responsible for those messages and their consequences. We point out therefore that inappropriate choices by the couple may lead to the consequent neurological changes and mental health symptoms we have mentioned. We finally analyse the act of sexual intercourse into a number of component functions (or consequences) including the Generative Function -that of producing another human person, the Choice Function -that of choosing the other person, the Language Function -that of communicating that choice to the other person and the Empowering Function-that of empowering the other person. We propose a model of human sexuality in which these four functions are linked together, so that in normal circumstances they work together in complete harmony, however, numerous circumstances of modern life can cause these four functions to operate asyncronously, thus leading to the neurological changes which we have mentioned above. These neurological changes are associated with the changes in hippocampal size which we have described above. Thus in our model, we have linked the Neurological changes of Trauma with factors relating to Choice, psychological concepts, and consequent symptomatology of illness. We do this in the context of a model of the Human Person in which mind and body are linked so that the human person can be understood as an 'Embodied Spirit', rather than the Cartesian Model. This concept goes back to the model of the Human Person of Aristotle, and was re-expressed in Medieval times by Aquinas and Augustine, and is congruent with Phenominology as expressed by Husserl and Stein. We have previously argued that such an 'Embodied Spirit' model of the Human Person is more congruent with modern neuroscience than a Cartesian Model (Agius 2017).",2021,,PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA,33,,S19-S26,WOS:000744167600004,,,#349,Agius 2021,"",""

This study there-fore examines the extent and forms of GBD among female medical students and physicians in Germany. Causes, consequences and possible interventions of GBD are discussed.Methods: Female medical students (n=235) and female physicians (n=157) from five university hospitals in northern Germany were asked about their personal experiences with GBD in an online survey on self -efficacy expectations and individual perceptions of the ""glass ceiling effect"" using an open-ended question regarding their own experiences with GBD. The answers were analyzed by content analysis using inductive category formation and relative category frequencies.Results: From both interviewed groups, approximately 75% each reported having experienced GBD. Their experiences fell into five main categories: sexual harassment with subcategories of verbal and physical, discrimination based on existing/possible motherhood with subcategories of structural and verbal, direct preference for men, direct neglect of women, and derogatory treatment based on gender.Conclusion: The study contributes to filling the aforementioned research gap. At the hospitals studied, GBD is a common phenomenon among both female medical students and physicians, manifesting itself in multiple forms. Transferability of the results beyond the hospitals studied to all of Germany seems plausible. Much is known about the causes, consequences and effective countermeasures against GBD.

Material and methods: The French Association of Urologists in Training performed a national online survey between August and September 2022. Participants were assured that their participation was anonymous. Respondents were questioned on demographics, gender discrimination and on pregnancy barriers during fellowship. Results: In total, 153 members answered the questionnaire out of the 427 members of the association (36%), among which 75 women (49%). Thirty nine percent of the female respondents found that their gender was a barrier in their career advancement, versus 1% of the male ( P < 0.0001). Forty female respondents (53%) perceived that female urologists earned less respect than their male counterparts versus 22% of the male ( P < 0.0001). Among the female respondents, 19 (25%) have felt that it would not be possible to become pregnant at the time they would have wanted it and 7 (9%) reported having already been threatened to lose a fellowship position in case of a pregnancy.

We also tested whether STEM encouragement from friends and family positively predicted motivation and aspirations. To consider domain-specific effects, we also tested the predictors in relation to non-STEM motivation and career aspirations. Students' grade point average was controlled in all analyses. The sample was undergraduate women enrolled in gateway biology courses for majors (N = 685; M = 19.67 years of age; 35% Asian, 31% White, and 27% Latinx).

Although 77 per cent of residents believed they would be supported by their program if they reported a sexual harassment event, only 43 per cent were aware of institutional support in place for victims at their program. Although there is a persistently high incidence of harassment in training, the avenues in which to report it are largely unknown and underused. Further research should focus on evidence-based interventions to encourage reporting and to design institutional programs for victims of sexual harassment.",2020,,AMERICAN SURGEON,86,1,65-72,WOS:000512985600030,,,#365,Arnold 2020,"",""
Considerations to Optimize Structurally Responsive Work Environments for US Military Specialty Physicians,"Tracy, E; Tilley, L; Patzkowski, J; Eliasen, KM; Hudson, A; Highland, KB","Introduction: Recruitment, training, and retention of wartime critical specialty physicians may be stymied by discrimination and abuse. It is unclear to what extent the US combat specialty physicians witness or experience discrimination and abuse, whether they or others intervene, and if they would subsequently discourage people from entering their field. Materials and Methods: The present study surveyed US active duty anesthesiologists, emergency medicine physicians, and orthopedic surgeons (N = 243; 21% response rate). A generalized linear model evaluated the extent to which gender, specialty, service, and number of witnessed/experienced negative/stigmatizing comment/event types were associated with burnout. A bootstrapped mediation analysis evaluated whether gender and burnout were mediated by the number of comment/event types. Results: The sample was majority non-Latine White (87%) and men (66%) with tri-service and specialty representation. The most commonly reported negative/stigmatizing comment/event types were related to pregnancy (62%) and parental leave (61%), followed by gender and assigned sex (42%), lactation (37%), and sexual harassment (35%). Of the respondents who witnessed/experienced such comments/events, self-intervention was reported after comments regarding lactation (43%), assigned sex and gender (42%), race and ethnicity (41%), pregnancy (41%), parental leave (37%), and sexual harassment (24%). Witnessing another person intervene was reported after sexual harassment (25%) and comments/events regarding race and ethnicity (24%), pregnancy (20%), assigned sex and gender (19%), lactation (19%), and parental leave (18%). Nonintervention was reported after comments/events related to parental leave (42%), pregnancy (38%), sexual harassment (26%), lactation (26%), assigned sex and gender (26%), and race and ethnicity (22%). Respondents reported moderate-to-high intervening likelihood, importance, and confidence. Respondents reporting neutral to extremely agree on prompts indicating that pregnant active duty physicians are trying to avoid deployment (P = .002) and expect special treatment that burdens the department (P = .007) were disproportionately men (36% and 38%, respectively) compared to women (14% and 18%, respectively). The highest proportion of neutral to extremely agree responses regarding discouraging specialty selection were reported in relation to transgender and gender diverse students (21%), followed by cisgender female students (18%); gay, lesbian, or bisexual+ students (17%); cisgender male students (13%); and racial and ethnic minoritized students (12%). In the primary model, the number of witnessed/experienced comment/event types was associated with greater burnout (0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.20, P = .001), but women did not report significantly different levels of burnout than men (0.20, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.51, P = 0.20). The number of comment/event types mediated the relationship between gender and burnout (0.18, 95% CI 0.06, 0.34; P < .001). Conclusions: Although reported intervening confidence, likelihood, and importance were high, it is unclear whether perceptions correspond to awareness of intervention need and behaviors. Bivariate differences in burnout levels between men and women were fully explained by the number of comment types in the mediation model. Annual trainings may not effectively address workplace climate optimization; institutions should consider targeted policy and programmatic efforts to ensure effective, structurally responsive approaches.",2024,,MILITARY MEDICINE,,,,WOS:001296264100001,10.1093/milmed/usae395,,#367,Tracy 2024,"",""

Sexual harassment victimization in adolescence: Associations with family background,"Kaltiala-Heino, R; Fröjd, S; Marttunen, M","Sexual harassment has been studies as a mechanism reproducing inequality between sexes, as gender based discrimination, and more recently, as a public health problem. The role of family-related factors for subjection to sexual harassment in adolescent has been little studied. Our aim was to study the role of socio-demographic family factors and parental involvement in adolescent's persona life for experiences of sexual harassment among 14-18-year-old population girls and boys. An anonymous cross-sectional classroom survey was carried out in comprehensive and secondary schools in Finland. 90 953 boys and 91 746 girls aged 14-18 participated. Sexual harassment was elicited with five questions. Family structure, parental education, parental unemployment and parental involvement as perceived by the adolescent were elicited. The data were analyzed using cross-tabulations with chi-square statistics and logistic regressions. All types of sexual harassment experiences elicited were more common among girls than among boys. Parental unemployment, not living with both parents and low parental education were associated with higher likelihood of reporting experiences of sexual harassment, and parental involvement in the adolescent's personal life was associated with less reported sexual harassment. Parental involvement in an adolescent's life may be protective of perceived sexual harassment. Adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged families are more vulnerable to sexual harassment than their more advantaged peers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Contextualising street sexual harassment in Morocco: a discriminatory sociocultural representation of women,"Chafai, H","This article aims to contextualise gender-based violence through the phenomenon of sexual harassment in public space in Morocco. This will be achieved by exploring the discriminatory social, cultural and political representation of Moroccan women, and discussing their status, image and treatment in a patriarchal social order. The study seeks to reveal the relationship between the stereotypical images of Moroccan girls and women and the violence that is likely committed against them. It suggests that women's location in the power structures of the family, school, media and the law, as well as their access to the economic and political spheres, all contribute to the construction and negotiation of gender roles, relationships and inequalities, and consequently participate in fostering violent attitudes and practices against women in the public arena. The evolution of the status of women will be primarily guaranteed by changes in their freedom-of-movement, security and emancipation. However, regularising gender inequalities and naturalising women's oppression remain obstacles that will encourage further harassment against women. Future research should address women's discourse and experiences of street harassment as well as its social meaning, prevalence, severity and impact in order to better define the phenomenon and thus contribute to improving the image of women in the Moroccan context.",2017,,JOURNAL OF NORTH AFRICAN STUDIES,22,5,821-840,WOS:000418506300009,10.1080/13629387.2017.1364633,,#373,Chafai 2017,"",""
Sexual Harassment of Female Providers by Patients: a Qualitative Study,"Scholcoff, C; Farkas, A; Machen, JL; Kay, C; Nickoloff, S; Fletcher, KE; Jackson, JL","Background Sexual harassment of women is a pervasive problem. Prior studies found that sexual harassment of female providers by patients is common, but guidance on addressing this problem is limited. Objective To understand the experiences of female providers with sexual harassment by patients with a focus on how practicing providers address these events. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Participants Twenty female, internal medicine providers, including resident physicians, staff physicians, and nurse practitioners at a large, urban, academic hospital in the USA. Approach Interviews were analyzed for themes. Key Results Two themes were explored: first, the experiences with sexual harassment and, second, the strategies to address sexual harassment. We coded four sub-themes regarding participant experiences: (1) their descriptions of the types of harassment, (2) the context of the event, (3) the impact of the harassment, and (4) their preparation to address the harassment. We coded seven sub-themes on strategies used by participants: (1) indirect strategies, (2) confrontation, (3) modifying the clinical encounter, (4) modifying self, (5) alerting others, (6) debrief, and (7) report. Conclusion Our qualitative study found that sexual harassment of female providers by patients is an ongoing problem, disruptive to the patient-provider relationship, and a possible threat to the well-being of both provider and patient. Formal training on how to address this problem was lacking, but all providers had developed or adapted strategies based on personal experiences or role modeling.

Links between Aggressive Sexual Fantasies and Sexual Coercion: A Replication and Extension of a Multifactorial Model,"Birke, JB; Jern, P; Johansson, A; Bondü, R","Current research indicates that aggressive sexual fantasies (ASF) are related to sexual aggression, above and beyond other risk factors for this behavior. There have, however, rarely been explicitly considered in multifactor models aiming to explain sexual aggression. One exception is the multifactorial Revised Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression that was replicated in two samples of male individuals who were convicted of sexual offenses and a small sample of men from the general population and evidenced a high relevance of ASF, respectively. There were, however, no further attempts to replicate the model in larger samples from the general population. We, therefore, used a subsample from the Finnish Genetics of Sexuality and Aggression project including 3269 men (age: M = 26.17 years, SD = 4.76) to do so. Cross-sectional latent structural equation models corroborated previous research and the assumption that ASF are a central component in multifactor models that aim to explain sexual aggression: ASF and antisocial behavior/aggression were equally important associates of sexual coercion when also considering adverse childhood experiences, hypersexuality, and callous-unemotional traits. Additionally, ASF mediated the links between hypersexuality, callous-unemotional traits, as well as childhood sexual abuse and sexual coercion. These links held stable when entering further risk factors, that is, distorted perceptions, rape-supportive attitudes, and violent pornography consumption into the model. Contrasting assumptions, alcohol consumption and antisocial behavior/aggression did not interact. These results illustrate the potential importance of ASF for sexual aggression. They indicate that ASF require consideration by research on sexual aggression as well as in the treatment and risk assessment of sexual perpetrators.",2024,,ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,53,3,1047-1063,WOS:001142904400001,10.1007/s10508-023-02782-5,,#375,Birke 2024,"",""

Association of Physician Characteristics With Perceptions and Experiences of Gender Equity in an Academic Internal Medicine Department,"Ruzycki, SM; Freeman, G; Bharwani, A; Brown, A","IMPORTANCE The persistence of inequities that disadvantage women physicians remains empirically underexplained. Understanding the cultural factors that are associated with disparities in harassment, discrimination, remuneration, and career trajectory are critical to addressing inequities.OBJECTIVES To explore how physicians perceive the climate for women physicians and compare perceptions and experiences of gender inequity among physicians based on characteristics including gender, faculty status, parental status, and years in practice.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This sequential, explanatory, mixed-methods qualitative study used the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS; range 45-225, with higher scores indicating better perceived culture toward women), followed by individual semistructured interviews with physicians at the Department of Medicine of the University of Calgary. All 389 physician members of the Department of Medicine, including academic and clinical physicians and those of any gender, were invited to participate in the survey and interview phases.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The culture within the department for women physicians was assessed using the CCWAS score. Scores were compared between respondents' gender and years in practice. Interviews with physicians were used to further explore findings from the CCWAS and to understand experiences and perceptions of gender disparities.RESULTS A total of 169 of 389 physicians completed the survey (response rate, 43.4%; 102 [59.9%] women; 65 [38.9%] men; and 2 [1.2%] who did not disclose gender); 28 participants (7.2%) elected to participate in an interview (22 [78.6%] women; 6 [21.4%] men). Women physicians perceived the culture of the department toward women as significantly worse than men physicians (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 137.0 [118.0-155.0] vs 164.5 [154.0-183.4]; P < .001). Physicians with more than 15 years in practice perceived the culture toward women as significantly more favorable than physicians with 15 years or less in practice (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 157.0 [138.8-181.3] vs 147.0 [127.5-164.3]; P = .02). Qualitative data demonstrated that experiences of junior women (ie, physicians who graduated medical school after 1996, when an equal number of men and women in medical school was achieved in Canada) and perceptions of senior men (ie, those who graduated before 1996) were most different; junior women reported high rates of discrimination and harassment, while senior men perceived that the Department of Medicine had achieved gender equity.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, senior men physicians' perceptions of gender equity were different from lived experiences of gender inequity reported by junior women physicians.

The objective of this study is to determine the representation of female academic radiologists in four flagship general radiology journals to elucidate gender-specific trends and disparities in academic radiology.Materials and Methods: We analyzed 23,741 peer-reviewed articles published in Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, Journal of the American College of Radiology and Academic Radiology from 2007 to 2020. Data abstraction and statistical analysis were per-formed for author gender, first and last authorship, research funding, and number of citations and grants. Baseline demographics data of academic radiologists was obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Results: A total of 72.4% of authors were male with 54% of articles were written by a male first author and male last author.

Gender discrimination in physics and astronomy: Graduate student experiences of sexism and gender microaggressions,"Barthelemy, RS; McCormick, M; Henderson, C","[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Gender in Physics.] Sexism occurs when men are believed to be superior to women, and is thought to be one of the reasons for women's underrepresentation in physics and astronomy. The issue of sexism in physics and astronomy has not been thoroughly explored in the physics education literature and there is currently no clear language for discussing sexism in the field. This article seeks to begin a conversation on sexism in physics and astronomy and offer a starting point for language to discuss sexism in research groups and departments. Interviews with 21 women in graduate physics and astronomy programs are analyzed for their individual experiences of sexism.

Sexual Harassment in Public Spaces: Examining Gender Differences in Perceived Seriousness and Victimization,"Madan, M; Nalla, MK","In this article, we examine the situational conditions of female sexual victimization in public spaces. Using survey questionnaire methodology, we explore gender differences in perceptions of the occurrence and location of sexual harassment in public spaces as well as the extent to which such behaviors are considered serious. The study's methodology relies on using multistage cluster and quota sampling technique, where we interviewed nearly 1,387 respondents (both men and women) from the capital city of India, New Delhi. This study finds an overall congruence between perceived likelihood of female sexual harassment victimization and actual self-reported victimization in most public transportation modes, but there is a significant gap between these two indicators for occurrences that take place in certain transportation modes, such as taxis and auto-rickshaws. There are statistically significant gender differences in the seriousness ratings of various behaviors that constitute sexual harassment to women.

"""Maybe this is just not the place for me:"" Gender harassment and discrimination in the geosciences","Mattheis, A; Marin-Spiotta, E; Nandihalli, S; Schneider, B; Barnes, RT","Rampant gender-based harassment and discrimination are recognized problems that negatively impact efforts to diversify science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We explored the particularities of this phenomenon in the geosciences, via focus groups conducted at STEM professional society meetings, with the goal of informing interventions specific to the discipline. Using grounded theory analysis, two primary drivers for the persistence and perpetuation of gender-based harassment in the geosciences were identified: a particular history of power dynamics and maintenance of dominant stereotypes, and a pattern of ineffective responses to incidents of harassment and discrimination. Informed by intersectional feminist scholarship by women of color that illustrates how efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in STEM without attending to the overlapping impacts of racism, colonialism, ableism, and classism will not succeed, we view harassment and discrimination as structural problems that require collective solutions. Continuing to recruit individuals into a discipline without changing its fundamental nature can tokenize and isolate them or encourage assimilation and acceptance of deep-seated traditions no matter how damaging. It is the responsibility of those in power, and especially those who hold more privileged status due to their social identities, to contribute to the dismantling of current structures that reinforce inequity. By providing explanatory illustrative examples drawn from first-person accounts we aim to humanize the numbers reported in workplace climate surveys, address gaps in knowledge specific to the geosciences, and identify interventions aligned with an intersectional framework that aim to disrupt discriminatory practices endemic to the geosciences and larger STEM community.",2022,,PLOS ONE,17,5,,WOS:000834613800006,10.1371/journal.pone.0268562,,#393,Mattheis 2022,"",""

Association of Contact Sexual Violence Victimization and Health in the US,"Basile, KC; Chen, J; Friar, NW; Smith, SG; Leemis, RW","Introduction: Sexual violence victimization is related to negative impacts, including chronic health conditions. Less is known about possible confounders of this relationship. This study examines the association between lifetime experience of contact sexual violence (CSV) and health conditions by sex, controlling for demographics and other victimization. Methods: Data are from the 2016/2017 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, a nationally representative study of English- or Spanish-speaking adults. Ten health conditions (e.g., HIV/ AIDS) and four activity limitations (e.g., dif fi culty dressing) were examined related to CSV victimization. Logistic regression models examined the association between CSV victimization and health controlling for demographics and other victimization experiences. Analyses were conducted in 2022 to 2023. Results: For women and men, many health conditions and activity limitations were signi fi cantly associated with CSV after controlling for demographics. Accounting for other victimization, female CSV victims had higher odds of experiencing dif fi culty sleeping (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=1.3); dif fi culty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions (AOR=1.7); and dif fi culty doing errands alone (AOR=1.4) than nonvictims. Male victims had higher odds than nonvictims of having HIV/AIDS (AOR=5.2); frequent headaches (AOR=1.5); chronic pain (AOR=1.5); dif fi culty sleeping (AOR=1.4); serious dif fi culty hearing (AOR=1.3); and dif fi culty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions (AOR=1.5). Conclusions: CSV had a negative impact on health, although other types of victimization appear to also have an impact, especially for women. Demographic characteristics also aid the understanding of the relationship between CSV and health. Efforts to prevent CSV and other forms of violence can be coupled with healthcare- and population-level approaches to improve long -term health. Am J Prev Med 2024;66(5):860 - 869.

Human resource practitioners as sexual harassment commissioners: Sisyphus amid gender inequalities,"Kuna, S; Nadiv, R","Purpose There has been ample research on the antecedents and consequences of workplace sexual harassment (WSH), a volatile issue in contemporary labor markets. There is, however, a lingering gap in the scholarly literature regarding the organizational practices involved in contending with WSH incidents following their occurrence. By exploring the practices and challenges of sexual harassment commissioners, a mandatory role performed by Israeli human resource practitioners, this study aims to unpack the embedded power dynamics, which construct how WSH is both deciphered and handled within organizations. Design/methodology/approach In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 sexual harassment commissioners (SHCs) in various business organizations in Israel to explore practitioners' conceptions of the challenges underlying their role. A grounded theory approach was utilized. Findings The findings demonstrate that, while SHCs seemingly are empowered by their exclusive authority to inquire into an intricate organizational matter, counter practices have emerged to undermine their authority and influence. This negatively affects their ability to reduce the prevalence of WSH. SHCs' attempts to approach WSH utilizing a power discourse are eroded by systematic barriers that channel them toward adoption of the default legal discourse. The latter frames WSH in terms of individual misconduct rather than as a phenomenon stemming from and expressive of organizational and societal gender inequalities. Research limitations/implications This study does not represent the voices of WSH complainants or of top executives. The data focused on SHCs' descriptions of their role challenges. Practical implications Implications are suggested regarding the academic education and training of SHCs.

A Systematic Literature Review of Sexual Harassment Studies with Text Mining,"Karami, A; Spinel, MY; White, CN; Ford, K; Swan, S","Sexual harassment has been the topic of thousands of research articles in the 20th and 21st centuries. Several review papers have been developed to synthesize the literature about sexual harassment. While traditional literature review studies provide valuable insights, these studies have some limitations including analyzing a limited number of papers, being time-consuming and labor-intensive, focusing on a few topics, and lacking temporal trend analysis. To address these limitations, this paper employs both computational and qualitative approaches to identify major research topics, explore temporal trends of sexual harassment topics over the past few decades, and point to future possible directions in sexual harassment studies. We collected 5320 research papers published between 1977 and 2020, identified and analyzed sexual harassment topics, and explored the temporal trend of topics. Our findings indicate that sexual harassment in the workplace was the most popular research theme, and sexual harassment was investigated in a wide range of spaces ranging from school to military settings. Our analysis shows that 62.5% of the topics having a significant trend had an increasing (hot) temporal trend that is expected to be studied more in the coming years. This study offers a bird's eye view to better understand sexual harassment literature with text mining, qualitative, and temporal trend analysis methods.

Gender discrimination of veterinary students and its impact on career aspiration: A mixed methods approach,"Freestone, K; Remnant, J; Gummery, E","Introduction As the veterinary profession has become feminised, gender discrimination and its effects have been documented in practicing veterinary surgeons. However, research on gender discrimination experienced by veterinary students and its effects on recruitment and retention remains limited. This study aimed to increase understanding of veterinary students' experiences of gender discrimination and its impact on their career aspirations. Methods A questionnaire including statements with Likert-style response options and free-text questions was distributed to students studying veterinary medicine and science at a UK veterinary school in September 2020 (28% response rate). Two focus groups were carried out following the questionnaire to gain a deeper insight into student experiences. Results Gender discrimination in a veterinary setting had been experienced by 34% of respondents, the majority (77%) on animal husbandry placements. Female students were more likely to report that their experiences of gender discrimination affected their career aspirations. Seven themes were identified from both the questionnaire and focus group data: stereotyping of certain fields, gender inequality on placements, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex, plus (LGBTQI+) community, encouraging reporting behaviours, barriers to reporting, education and the placement allocation. Conclusions This study highlighted that gender discrimination was prevalent during animal husbandry placements, although reporting was infrequent and perceived negatively by students.

"Racial, Socioeconomic, and Attitudinal Disparities in Trajectories of Young Women's Willingness to Refuse Unwanted Sex","Weitzman, A; Mallory, AB","Purpose: We identify trajectories of young women's willingness to refuse unwanted sex, assess racial, socioeconomic, and attitudinal variation across trajectory groups, and describe the sexual and relationship behaviors of different trajectory groups.Methods: Panel data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life study facilitate a latent class analysis identifying trajectories of women's willingness to refuse unwanted sex, followed by bivariate analyses illuminating demographic, attitudinal, experiential, and behavioral correlates of each trajectory.Results: Three trajectories emerge confident (stable high), moderate (slightly declining moderate), and reluctant (low-U). Socially advantaged women were most likely to follow a confident trajectory. Black women, socially disadvantaged women, women with early sexual debut, women with early births, and women who adhere to rape myths were most likely to follow a reluctant trajectory. Women whose trajectory was moderate spent the most time in relationships and had sex most often.Conclusions: How much young women are willing to refuse unwanted sex and how this willingness changes during the transition to adulthood vary with key characteristics of their demographic background, earlier sexual experiences, and perceptions of rape. The trajectories by which this willingness evolves further correspond with sexual and relationship behaviors during the transition to adulthood. Greater research on whether willingness to refuse unwanted sex affects behavior and/or vice versa is needed to more fully understand the diversity of women's sexual experiences and to develop effective interventions for improving women's willingness to refuse unwanted sex.

Barriers to reporting in EM are largely unknown. This study explored barriers to reporting gender and sexual harassment among EM faculty and residents and potential improvements to reporting systems. Methods We conducted semistructured interviews with EM faculty and residents across the United States, utilizing purposive sampling to ensure diverse representation. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded by two independent investigators. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation and prominent themes were identified from coded data. Results A total of 32 interviews were completed with women and men faculty and residents. Prominent themes were identified representing compounding barriers to reporting. Participants described confusion over what constitutes a reportable definition of gender and sexual harassment, unfamiliarity with reporting processes, and multiple avenues (both informal and formal through departmental, hospital, and institutional systems) for reporting. Participants expressed limited confidence in formal reporting systems and related several perceived and actual negative outcomes of reporting. A number of improvements were recommended centering around creating reporting systems that supported, empowered, and protected survivors; improving transparency about reporting processes; and ensuring accountability at a departmental and institutional level.

Workplace Violence and the Impostor Phenomenon in Medicine: A US-Based Qualitative Study,"Chakraverty, D","Physicians experience impostor phenomenon when they attribute their success to luck and fraudulence rather than ability or competence. They also experience workplace violence, including sexual and nonsexual harassment, discrimination, microaggression, and assault, among others. Using Weiner's attribution theory, this qualitative study interviewed US-based physicians experiencing impostor phenomenon to investigate its connection with workplace violence. Two research questions were examined: What are the different forms of workplace violence reported in medicine? How does workplace violence contribute to impostor phenomenon? Interested participants responded to an advertisement about a national study examining impostor phenomenon at a US-based medical conference (convenience sampling). After the interview, many participants shared the study information in their professional and social network, encouraging others to participate (snowball sampling). Data were analyzed using constant comparison and analytic induction. Sixty-three physicians completed the initial survey and were all invited for the interview. Thirty-five out of them interviewed and the rest did not respond to the invitation email. Of those 35 physicians, 19 (95% women; 79% white) between ages 30-59 years specifically reported experiencing impostor phenomenon when facing physical, verbal, racial, and/or gendered violence. Gendered violence included both gender-based assumption of position or competence and gender-based harassment. Impostor phenomenon occurred when women and men were treated differently; participants questioned their competency or belonging; and women saw fewer women physicians around them and other women perpetrating violence. The impostor phenomenon was attributed to an external experience of violence perpetrated by people of all genders and relationship types, including seniors and peers, physicians, patients, and nurses. Participants often could not control violence perpetration and instead, internalized the experience as their fault and lost a sense of belongingness at work. Findings, while not generalizable and based on a small sample, show that impostor phenomenon is not only affected by individualized internal mechanisms, but external environmental factors as well such as experiencing violence or seeing it happen to others. Future research should explore the role of race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender orientation, socioeconomic status, and generation status in shaping such experiences.",2024,,VIOLENCE AND GENDER,11,2,105-113,WOS:001208467800001,10.1089/vio.2023.0062,,#404,Chakraverty 2024,"",""

We identified three themes: (1) people (how and who): women seek out and receive sponsorship differently; (2) process (faster and further): sponsorship provides an extra boost, especially for women; and (3) politics and culture (playing favorites and paying it forward): sponsorship and fairness. Informants acknowledge that sponsorship provides an extra boost for career advancement especially for women. Sponsors and proteges differ in their perceptions of how sponsorship happens. Informants describe gender differences in how sponsorship is experienced and specifically noted that women were less likely to actively seek out sponsorship and be identified as proteges compared to men. Informants describe a tension between sponsorship and core academic values such as transparency, fairness, and merit.

Women's educational attainment and sexual coercion by intimate partners: ethnic differences in Vietnam,"Do, HTT; Sukontamarn, P","Vietnam, a lower-middle-income nation with a strong patriarchal influence in Southeast Asia, has experienced an increase in intimate partner sexual violence. Despite its ethnic diversity and varying socio-economic status, research addressing ethnic differences in intimate partner sexual abuse within the country remains scarce. This quantitative study utilized the most recent and nationally representative dataset from the Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2020-2021 to explore the relationship between women's educational attainment and sexual coercion by intimate partners, with a focus on ethnic differences in this relationship. The chi-square (chi(2)) test of independence was used for bivariate statistics, whereas a probit model with probability sampling weights was employed for multivariate analysis. The sample comprises 6,033 women of reproductive age.

"Perceptions of gender equality, work environment, support and social issues for women doctors at a university hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Baqi, S; Albalbeesi, A; Iftikhar, S; Baig-Ansari, N; Alanazi, M; Alanazi, A","The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is an Islamic monarchy and was established in 1932. Saudi women first entered the medical field in 1975 and the country has since seen a steady increase in women pursuing medicine. However, there is limited data on gender related issues for women doctors practicing in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, our study objective was to assess the perception amongst peers regarding gender equality and social issues faced by women doctors in Saudi Arabia. An online anonymous cross-sectional survey was administered in English to doctors at King Khalid Hospital, affiliated to King Saud University, in Riyadh, between April and May of 2016. Of 1015 doctors, 304 (30%) participated, of which 129 (42.4%) were females and 231 (76%) were Saudi nationals. The average age was 32.4 years (+/- SD: 8.7). The majority opined that there was no gender discrimination in salaries (73.7% p-value = 0.4), hospital benefits (62.2% p-value = 0.06) or entry into any field of Medicine/Pediatrics (68.4% p-value = 0.207). However, only a minority believed that there was no gender discrimination for entry into surgery (37.3% p-value =.091). A higher proportion of male doctors agreed that promotion opportunities are equal (66.3% vs 45.7%, p-value = 0.002). However, of 54 consultants, only 18 (33.3%) were women. Over half of the women (52.3%) reported that they never wear the face veil. Only a minority of male and female doctors (12.2%) believed women doctors should wear the veil since they examine male patients. Fewer respondents believed that female doctors face harassment from male doctors (14.5%) whereas 30.7% believed female doctors face harassment from male patients. More females, than males, agreed with the statement that female doctors are as committed to their careers as are males (92.2% vs 67.4%, p-value<0.0001). Of 304 participants, 210 (69.1%) said that they would still choose to become a doctor with approximately equal proportions between males and females (68% vs 70.5%, p-value = 0.79). In conclusion, our survey of male and female doctors at a government university hospital in Saudi Arabia revealed that the majority believed there was gender equality amongst doctors in terms of salaries, benefits, opportunities for promotion and entry into any field of medicine or pediatrics, but not surgery. However, there were significantly fewer women at consultant positions, a deficiency that needs to be addressed.",2017,,PLOS ONE,12,10,,WOS:000413845400070,10.1371/journal.pone.0186896,,#420,Baqi 2017,"",""

"Doctoral students' perceived working environment, obstacles and opportunities at a Swedish medical faculty: a qualitative study","Falk, LL; Augustin, H; Torén, K; Magnusson, M","BackgroundInvestment in research is high on the agenda of many countries in recognition of the fact that research is important for the development of society. Doctoral students have a vital role and represent a substantial part of this investment. It is therefore imperative to reduce the risk of students dropping out from doctoral studies. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain deeper insight into the working conditions of, and obstacles and opportunities for, doctoral students at an institute of medicine in Sweden.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with 17 doctoral students-of varying genders, professions and fields of research-from the Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using systematic text condensation.ResultsFour categories emerged from the data. They were: Safety, Frustrating Structures, Others - not me, and the future. They included positive as well as negative perceptions. Among the positive perceptions were recognition of the importance of the supervisor, as well as secure conditions, and personal development. Frustrating structures in the academic culture, stress and differences in career building constituted the negative points.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that there is a need for structures within the university that support doctoral students who feel they are not receiving the assistance they need, who believe they have unreasonable working conditions, or who may need to change supervisors in order to complete their graduate research studies. Our study also highlights the fact that supervisors have a major influence on the work environment of doctoral students, and that the general and academic perception of the research area likewise has an effect on the successful completion of the research project and dissertation. Providing leadership training for supervisors could be an important measure that may help improve conditions for the doctoral students they supervise.",2019,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,19,,,WOS:000475535900004,10.1186/s12909-019-1684-x,,#422,Falk 2019,"",""
Psyche Meets the Gatekeepers: Creating a More Humane Culture for Women in Medicine,"Flaherty, SM; Misra, M; Scott-Vernaglia, SE; Taveras, EM; Israel, EJ","In the Greek myth of Psyche and Eros, Psyche must fulfill four seemingly impossible tasks to achieve full consciousness before she can be reunited with her bridegroom, Eros. From early childhood, girls and women can encounter gender stereotyping, sexual harassment and assault, and other gender-related challenges. Although both men and women can face mistreatment in medical school, female students experience sexual harassment and sexual assault at higher rates than male students. In medical training and career advancement, women often face additional obstacles unrelated to the formal education of physicians, such as salary and promotional disparities, and lack of mentorship, sponsorship, or role models. The suicide rate for male physicians is nearly 1.5 times higher than the general population; for female physicians, it is more than twice as high. Parenthood can pose additional challenges for mothers and fathers early in their academic careers, and women are vastly underrepresented as they try to move past the ""gatekeepers"" into leadership roles. Using the framework of the Psyche and Eros myth to examine the trajectory of a female physician's career, this article provides insights into these challenges, as well as strategies to address some of these inequities, such as programs to support female promotion and leadership, expanded mentorship and mentor models, sponsorship opportunities, leadership accountability, implicit bias training, and others.

Existing research has been limited by a lack of comprehensive, validated measures, low response rates, and narrow samples as well as comparisons limited to the binary gender categories of male or female assigned at birth (cisgender).OBJECTIVE To evaluate academic medical culture, faculty mental health, and their relationship.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 830 faculty members in the US received National Institutes of Health career development awards from 2006-2009, remained in academia, and responded to a 2021 survey that had a response rate of 64%. Experiences were compared by gender, race and ethnicity (using the categories of Asian, underrepresented in medicine [defined as race and ethnicity other than Asian or non-Hispanic White], and White), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) status. Multivariable models were used to explore associations between experiences of culture (climate, sexual harassment, and cyber incivility) with mental health.EXPOSURES Minoritized identity based on gender, race and ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ status.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three aspects of culture were measured as the primary outcomes: organizational climate, sexual harassment, and cyber incivility using previously developed instruments. The 5-item Mental Health Inventory (scored from 0 to 100 points with higher values indicating better mental health) was used to evaluate the secondary outcome of mental health.RESULTS Of the 830 faculty members, there were 422 men, 385 women, 2 in nonbinary gender category, and 21 who did not identify gender; there were 169 Asian respondents, 66 respondents underrepresented in medicine, 572 White respondents, and 23 respondents who did not report their race and ethnicity; and there were 774 respondents who identified as cisgender and heterosexual, 31 as having LGBTQ+ status, and 25 who did not identify status. Women rated general climate (5-point scale) more negatively than men (mean, 3.68 [95% CI, 3.59-3.77] vs 3.96 [95% CI, 3.88-4.04], respectively, P < .001). Diversity climate ratings differed significantly by gender (mean, 3.72 [95% CI, 3.64-3.80] for women vs 4.16 [95% CI, 4.09-4.23] for men, P < .001) and by race and ethnicity (mean, 4.0 [95% CI, 3.88-4.12] for Asian respondents, 3.71 [95% CI, 3.50-3.92] for respondents underrepresented in medicine, and 3.96 [95% CI, 3.90-4.02] for White respondents, P = .04). Women were more likely than men to report experiencing gender harassment (sexist remarks and crude behaviors) (71.9% [95% CI, 67.1%-76.4%] vs 44.9% [95% CI, 40.1%-49.8%], respectively, P < .001). Respondents with LGBTQ+ status were more likely to report experiencing sexual harassment than cisgender and heterosexual respondents when using social media professionally (13.3% [95% CI, 1.7%-40.5%] vs 2.5% [95% CI, 1.2%-4.6%], respectively, P = .01). Each of the 3 aspects of culture and gendedr were significantly associated with the secondary outcome of mental health in the multivariable analysis.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE High rates of sexual harassment, cyber incivility, and negative organizational climate exist in academic medicine, disproportionately affecting minoritized groups and affecting mental health.

"'So, What is a Good Masculinity?': Navigating Normativity in Violence Prevention with Men and Boys","McCook, S","Engaging men and boys to address the links between masculinity and gendered violence is a rapidly expanding space for primary prevention, in Australia and globally. There are parallel debates within feminist commentary on violence prevention and in masculinity studies over how to conceptualise and deconstruct masculinity for the long-term transformation of gender inequality. This article analyses semi-structured interviews with Australian prevention practitioners whose work focuses on engaging men and boys, which included initiatives aimed at gender equality, healthy masculinity, preventing violence against women, and domestic/family violence prevention. Interviews highlighted that these practitioners are currently grappling with how to address masculinity as a construct and/or a normative process within their work to achieve gender transformative change. These tensions reflect ongoing concerns over reproducing narrow associations between men and masculinity that perpetuate essentialised identity categories. Importantly, I question whether a focus on 'positive' or 'healthy' masculinities can effectively go beyond the binary gender relations that underpin gendered violence.

#MeToo in British schools: Gendered differences in teenagers' awareness of sexual violence,"Horeck, T; Ringrose, J; Milne, B; Mendes, K","This article explores how British secondary school students responded to and made sense of the rising public awareness of sexual violence in British society that emerged during lockdowns for COVID-19. Based on the findings from a 2021-2022 study conducted in five secondary schools, the article explores the gendered discrepancies in girls' and boys' awareness of violence against girls and women. In particular, it examines how the youth participants in this study responded to two related media stories during lockdown: the news of Sarah Everard's kidnapping and murder by a police officer and the viral spread of sexual abuse testimonies on the 'Everyone's Invited' Instagram page and website. The article demonstrates how girls were more likely to experience, recognize, and discuss sexual violence, in part due to feminist consciousness raising during lockdown via digital technologies like Instagram and TikTok. Although some boys did recognize the problem of violence against women, in general, they were much less aware of Sarah Everard's murder and Everyone's Invited and were prone to absorbing manosphere-like discourses around false rape accusations In focus groups, some boys deployed a defensive masculinity and adopted a discourse of male victimhood, which denied the scale and scope of violence against girls and women. However, through involving boys in focus group discussion with both us and their male peers about power and privilege, progress was made in challenging and counteracting rape myths and anti-feminist male victimization narratives.",2024,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,27,5,856-875,WOS:001050700800001,10.1177/13675494231191490,,#428,Horeck 2024,"",""
The sexual street harassment battle: perceptions of women in urban India,"Bharucha, J; Khatri, R","Purpose In India, women feel unsafe particularly in public spaces and single women feel threatened in almost every context (Nag, 2016). The purpose of this paper is to examine women's safety in the metropolitan city of Mumbai and argue that we need to address this issue and respond to the dearth of firsthand knowledge about women's safety in India which is investigated in light of the social and cultural milieu. The study makes several recommendations based on the research findings.Design/methodology/approach The data collection was done in three separate stages. In the first phase, a structured questionnaire was administered orally to around 300 working women all over the city of Mumbai and its suburbs. The second stage adopted an exploratory qualitative approach using in-depth interviews and reflections. In the third stage, the authors audited busy areas on various parameters that might hamper women's safety.Findings All the raw data obtained were analyzed using qualitative data coding and categorized to generate themes. Six clear themes emerged which include: perception of safety; safety in transportation; actual violation of personal or physical safety; negligible reaction by the victims; experience with the police; and firsthand recommendations and strategies. This study brings to light the disturbing fact that 91 percent of women worry about their safety all the time or most of the time when they are outside their homes. On the streets of the city almost all had experienced some tangible threats to their safety at some point of time.Originality/value Hypocrisy in the treatment of women is precisely what makes India unsafe for women. Although Mumbai ranks as the safest city in India, the study portrays that it is unsafe and fearsome for women.

Gender Differences in the Emotional Response and Subjective Sexual Arousal Toward Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse: A Pupillometric Study,"Carvalho, J; Rosa, PJ","Background: Gender differences in sexual response have targeted individuals' emotional appraisal of mainstream erotica. Yet, evidence reveals that men and women commonly endorse non-normative sexual interests, and no evidence has been collected on their emotional responses toward deviant sexual stimuli.Aim: This study was aimed at evaluating gender differences in the emotional responses toward non-consensual sexual intercourse, thus revealing individuals' appraisal of non-normative sexual contents. In order to provide an initial background to interpret findings, this study further tested the association between individuals' emotional responses and sexual self-schemas (SSSs).Methods: 29 men and 45 women (all heterosexual) were voluntarily exposed to audiovisual presentations of non-consensual/physically forced sexual intercourse in a laboratory context. Markers of emotional response were collected by psychophysiological and self-report means.Outcomes: Pupil activation, namely pupil diameter ratio, during exposure to the video clips was captured with an eye tracker. Positive and negative emotions and subjective sexual arousal toward the clips were also collected. In addition, participants responded to the SSS scale assessing individuals' sexual self-perceptions.Results: Findings revealed a small degree of gender differences. While men reported significantly more positive emotions toward the clip displaying a woman as recipient to non-consensual sex, no further differences were found. Also, participants revealed an increased pupil diameter ratio only in the first moments of the video clips. SSSs, including themes of aggression and power, were associated with men's emotional responses toward the clips, while no associations were found in women.Clinical Translation: Despite its preliminary nature, the current study provides evidence on the emotional mechanisms underpinning human sexual response, and may eventually translate to conceptualizing models with a focus on non-normative sexual behavior.Strengths & Limitations: To our best knowledge, this is the first study researching gender specificities in the emotional appraisal of non-consented sex. Current findings may help to understand individuals' deviant sexual interests and establish a framework for future research in this area. However, it is worth noting that lack of previous research prevents the generalization of findings and limits our interpretation of data.Conclusion: Findings revealed a small degree of gender differences in the emotional appraisal of non-consensual sexual intercourse, and suggested partial evidence in the relationship between sexual self-perceptions and emotional responses to forced sex.

Bystander intervention education is a potential approach which frames violence as a community issue where all members have a role to play in response and prevention. This study assessed the presence and influence of bystanders in SH situations for students at two medical schools.Materials and methodsData came from a larger U.S. campus climate study administered online in 2019 and 2020. The sample included 584 students who responded to validated survey questions about sexual harassment experiences, bystander behavior, disclosure, perceptions of the university response to SH, and demographics.ResultsMore than one-third of respondents experienced some form of SH by a faculty/staff member. Bystanders were present for more than half of these incidents, yet they rarely intervened. When bystanders intervened, people were more likely to disclose an incident than not.ConclusionsThe results indicate that there are many missed opportunities for intervention and given the profound impact that SH has on the well-being of medical students, continued work is needed to determine effective intervention and prevention methods.Practice pointsOne-third of the medical students surveyed in our sample reported experiencing SH; women and LGBT medical students are more likely to experience SH than their counterparts.Bystanders are frequently present during SH incidents; however, the percentage of situations where bystanders actually intervened was extremely low.Bystander intervention was correlated with an increased likelihood to disclose.

This study assesses how medical students' gender-based perceptions of surgical careers are impacted by attending the Surgical Exploration and Discovery (SEAD) program, a 2-week, immersive procedural program that offers observerships, mentorship, and workshops across 8 surgical specialties.DESIGN: In this mixed-method prospective cohort study, medical students' awareness, beliefs, and experiences of gender bias in surgery were assessed using a 10-item Gender Bias in Medical Students Assessment-Surgery (GBMSA-S) psychometric survey instrument inspired by the validated Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (Parker et al., 2016).SETTING: Undergraduate Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen first-year medical students in the experimental group (8 male, 10 female) and 18 in the control group (7 male, 11 female).RESULTS: Compared to the control group, SEAD participants had significant changes in agreement with the statements: ""surgery is male-dominated,"" ""medical studies are mainly done in males,"" ""gender discrimination is more pronounced in surgery than other medical professions,"" ""consideration of my gender is an important factor in whether or not to pursue surgery as a career,"" and ""I have encountered gender-biased attitudes and/or behaviors among non-physician health care staff' (p < 0.05). Perceptions of gender bias were reduced post-SEAD. Subgroup analysis by gender suggested that the significance of these changing perspectives was due to female participants' responses. SEAD also produced an increase in the level of interest in surgery (p = 0.04). Receptive and authentic dialogue was identified as a critical step toward social inclusivity (n = 11).CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical exposure through SEAD produces a statistically significant increase in surgical interest and reduces certain perceptions of gender bias in surgery, particularly among female medical students.

"Age, Marital Status, and Risk of Sexual Victimization: Similarities and Differences Across Victim-Offender Relationships","Siddique, JA","By now, age and marital status are well-established correlates of criminal victimization, including adult women's sexual victimization. National crime statistics, as well as a large body of scholarly literature, have specified that younger women and unmarried women are at comparatively higher risk of sexual victimization than older women and married women. Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between age, marital status, and risk of victimization across diverse situational contexts of sexual victimization. The current study used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to examine whether the relationship between age, marital status, and risk of sexual victimization varied across victimization experiences involving three victim-offender relationships: stranger, acquaintance, and intimate partner. Results indicate both similarities and differences in the relationship between age, marital status, and risk of victimization across these three situational contexts of victimization. As expected, age was a significant predictor of victimization in all models; however, younger women's increased risk of victimization was far more pronounced for acquaintance and intimate partner victimization experiences as compared with stranger experiences. Also, consistent with prior research, unmarried women were at higher risk of victimization in all models; however, within unmarried status categories, separated women were at highest risk of both intimate partner and acquaintance victimization experiences as compared with never married or divorced women.",2016,,JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,31,15,2556-2575,WOS:000382222200003,10.1177/0886260515579507,,#439,Siddique 2016,"",""
"Dependence on tips and sexual harassment vulnerability of hotel employees in Accra, Ghana","Mensah, C","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceived dependence on tips and vulnerability to sexual harassment (SH) among hotel employees in Accra Metropolis, Ghana.Design/methodology/approach - Within a cross-sectional research design, 583 employees from 55 hotels completed self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, chi(2) test of independence, Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyse collected data.Findings - Results of the study reveal that dependence on tips is related to SH vulnerability of food and beverage staff. Furthermore, dependence on tips engenders a perception of SH climate. Compared to guests and co-workers, supervisors were least identified as perpetrators of SH in hotel workspaces. Guests were responsible for unwanted sexual attention, whereas co-workers pose the greatest risk for gender harassment.Practical implications - Hotel management should invest in the publication of educational materials such as leaflets and posters indicating unacceptability of inappropriate sexual behaviours.Originality/value - This paper is one of the pioneers to have assessed the relationship between dependence on tips and perceived climate for SH as well as vulnerability to SH in a hotel context.",2019,,JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INSIGHTS,2,4,451-468,WOS:000497986500009,10.1108/JHTI-02-2019-0018,,#440,Mensah 2019,"",""
Gender balance in the medical workplace - A snapshot into anesthesia,"Noronha, B; Fuchs, A; Zdravkovic, M; Berger-Estilita, J","There is a growing interest in gender equity issues in general society and medicine. Literature shows several publications addressing female underrepresentation in medicine and doctors' perceptions on gender equity. Similar holds for anaesthesiology and perioperative intensive medicine. Despite their equal representation in medical schools, women remain a minority in many fields, and the gender ratio in the workforce, including leadership positions, is dominated by men. However, many studies support that women's presence in a group enhances the team's skill diversity, leads to a more stable governance and can improve patients' outcomes. Four main explanations for the gender gap constitute the pollution theory, unconscious gender bias, motherhood penalty and impostor syndrome. Understanding these processes can help develop successful strategies to achieve gender balance. Our goals were to review evidence regarding gender and productivity, understand gender discrimination and discuss potential strategies towards achieving gender equity and equality, particularly in anaesthesiology. These insights could inform faculty development programs and help guide institutional changes. Raising awareness of the gender imbalance, having zero tolerance towards discrimination, answering the inequity situations in a goal-oriented way and developing strategies as mentorship programs should be initiated and reinforced to address the issues mentioned.

Exploring gender disparity in medicine: perceptions of female physicians in Lebanon,"Kassouf, S; Nassar, E; Cherri, H; Mortada, S; Eid, K; Khalife, L; Daccache, A; Abi-Gerges, A","BackgroundGlobal research on gender bias has highlighted key trends in discrimination and inequality across various fields, including medicine. In Lebanon, a nation celebrated for its diverse cultural landscape and increasing female representation in medical education, there has been a notable absence of studies exploring gender dynamics in the medical profession.MethodsTo address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey to explore the Lebanese population's perceptions towards female physicians and the quality of care they provide.ResultsThe mean age of the study sample (n = 330) was 31.55 +/- 10.07 years and included 114 females and 216 males. Most respondents had received care from a female physician. Notably, those who selected female physicians as their family doctors or had female doctors within their immediate family displayed a stronger tendency to engage in annual medical check-ups. While most respondents did not express any preference for the gender of their general practitioner or surgeon, there was a marked preference for female obstetricians/gynecologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, and dermatologists. This preference was attributed to perceptions of female physicians being particularly compassionate, understanding, and proficient in communication.ConclusionThis study represents a groundbreaking contribution to understanding gender perceptions in the Lebanese medical field. It highlights the growing trust and positive regard for female physicians, underscoring the significant role in shaping healthcare experiences and outcomes in Lebanon.",2024,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,24,1,,WOS:001338461600001,10.1186/s12909-024-06131-5,,#442,Kassouf 2024,"",""
Adverse Childhood Experiences Associated with Greater Internalization of Weight Stigma in Women with Excess Weight,"Keirns, NG; Tsotsoros, CE; Addante, S; Layman, HM; Krems, JA; Pearl, RL; Tomiyama, AJ; Hawkins, MAW","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may be an early life factor associated with adult weight stigma via biological (e.g., stress response), cognitive (e.g., self-criticism/deprecation), and/or emotional (e.g., shame) mechanisms. This pilot study investigated relationships between ACEs and internalized and experienced weight stigma in adult women with overweight/obesity and explored differential relationships between weight stigma and ACE subtypes (i.e., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction). Adult women (68% white, Mage = 33 +/- 10 years, MBMI = 33.7 +/- 7.2 kg/m2) completed measures of ACEs (ACE Questionnaire), internalized weight stigma (IWS; Weight Bias Internalization Scale-Modified; WBIS-M), and lifetime experiences of weight stigma (yes/no). Data were analyzed with linear and logistic regression (n = 46), adjusting for age, race, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regressions revealed a positive association between ACE and WBIS-M scores (beta = 0.40, p = 0.006), which was driven by Abuse-type ACEs (beta = 0.48, p = 0.009). Relationships between WBIS-M scores and Neglect- and Household-Dysfunction-type ACEs did not reach significance (beta = 0.20, p = 0.173; beta = -0.16, p = 0.273). Though descriptive statistics revealed greater rates of experienced weight stigma endorsement by those with high-3+ ACEs (81%) vs. medium-1-2 ACEs (67%) or low/no-0 ACEs (60%), ACE scores were not significantly associated with experienced weight stigma in logistic regression (Wald = 1.36, p = 0.244, OR = 1.324, 95%, CI = 0.825-2.125).

"Sexual assault and harassment of doctors, by doctors: a qualitative study","Stone, L; Phillips, C; Douglas, KA","Context Although sexual harassment frequently occurs in medical education and medical workplaces, doctors who have been sexually harassed or assaulted by other doctors remain a largely invisible population. This study aimed to identify, using personal accounts, the impact on doctors of sexual harassment and assault by doctors in the workplace. Methods This narrative study used in-depth interviews, legal reports and victim impact statements, tracing trajectories from the event's pre-history to its aftermath and impact on professional practice. Participants were six Australian women doctors who had been subjected to one or more non-consensual sexual acts through coercion or intimidation by another doctor in their working environments, within hospital training programmes. Results All women identified long-term personal and professional impacts of their experience. Three women had never reported the abuse. The meaning and impact of sexual abuse for the doctors followed a trajectory with discrete phases: prelude, assault, limbo, exposure and aftermath. Discounting the event and its impacts, and returning to the workplace were characterised as 'being professional'. Those who sought legal restitution said it damaged their personal well-being and their standing among fellow doctors. Discussion Understanding the phases of experience of abuse enables the development of effective interventions for different phases. Interventions to minimise the risk of occurrence of sexual abuse must be distinguished from interventions to increase reporting rates, and interventions to mitigate harm and impact on victims' futures.

Specialty Gender Composition and Prevalence of Physician Harassment,"Hu, XC; Conrad, S; Dill, M","Background: Women physicians remain a minority in most medical specialties and are at higher risk of workplace harassment than men. This research examines the relationship between a medical specialty's gender composition and physicians' workplace harassment experience.Materials and Methods: We used the Association of American Medical Colleges' National Sample Survey of Physicians 2019 (n = 6000). Participants self-reported harassment experiences in the 12 months preceding the survey, including threats of physical harm, physical harm, offensive and sexist remarks, and unwanted sexual advances from patients and coworkers. We used data from the American Medical Association to determine medical specialties' gender composition. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the relationship between harassment experiences and specialty gender composition.Results: Women and men physicians reported threats and harm at similar rates. However, women reported offensive, sexist remarks and unwanted sexual advances more frequently. We found greater representation of women within a specialty is associated with a lower prevalence of harassment experienced by men and women physicians (e.g., threats of physical harm, odds ratio [OR] = 0.973 [women] and 0.984 [men], and unwanted sexual advances, OR = 0.976 [women] and 0.981 [men]). Also, as women's representation in a specialty increases, the gender gap in experiences of most types of harassment decreases.Conclusions: Greater representation of women within a medical specialty is associated with a safer environment for both men and women physicians and narrower gender gaps in harassment experience.

Gender and the Experience of Mental Health Expert Witness Testimony,"Kaempf, AC; Baxter, P; Packer, IK; Pinals, DA","Mental health expert witness testimony involves complex tasks, and the capacity to perform under pressure is a fundamental skill of a forensic professional. In this context, it is important to understand the nuances of the provision of expert witness testimony. There have been several efforts to examine gender bias across legal and medical systems. Despite these reviews, little is known about how men and women differ or are similar with regard to performing expert witness functions. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether the testimony experiences of psychiatry and psychology experts vary by gender. Differences across certain domains, such as the sense of never experiencing anxiety and the sense of one's impact on case outcome were seen across genders. Few other gender-based differences in the experience of providing expert witness testimony were seen. Although the findings of this study raise further questions, they highlight some of the important subtleties noted in forensic practice and the work of the expert witness. In future studies, researchers should continue to explore these findings on the influence of gender and expand to consider culture and race as additional factors in the experience of expert witness testimony.

In most of them, the request to participate of a sexual activity stems from the female condition, which motivated sexual desires in her superior or colleague. The fact that the criminal and labor laws do not make any gender cut for the practice of sexual harassment allows that in concrete situations women could be criminally punished, dismissed for just cause, and sentenced to repair the victim, whether male or female. It also allows male harassers to be punished in the three spheres for harassing another male.

While these gender-based challenges are well described, strategies to navigate and respond to them are less understood.OBJECTIVE: To explore the lived experiences of female teaching attending physicians emphasizing strategies they use to mitigate gender-based challenges in clinical environments.DESIGN: Multisite exploratory, qualitative study.SETTING: Inpatient general medicine teaching rounds in six geographically diverse US academic hospitals between April and August 2018.PARTICIPANTS: With use of a modified snowball sampling approach, female attendings and their learners were identified; six female attendings and their current (n = 24) and former (n = 17) learners agreed to participate.MEASUREMENTS: Perceptions of gender-based challenges in clinical teaching environments and strategies with which to respond to these challenges were evaluated through semistructured in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and direct observations of rounds. Observations were documented using handwritten field notes. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed. All transcripts and field note data were analyzed using a content analysis approach.MAIN OUTCOMES: Attending experience levels ranged from 8 to 20 years (mean, 15.3 years). Attendings were diverse in terms of race/ethnicity. Strategic approaches to gender-based challenges clustered around three themes: female attendings (1) actively position themselves as physician team leaders, (2) consciously work to manage gender-based stereotypes and perceptions, and (3) intentionally identify and embrace their unique qualities.CONCLUSION: Female attendings manage their roles as women in medicine through specific strategies to both navigate complex gender dynamics and role model approaches for learners.

Within identity management theoretical work, there has been little attention to occupational influences. Based on role congruity theory, we investigate occupational characteristics as influences on women's gender identity management, along with individual differences and organizational support influences. Results suggest that engaging in identity management behaviours is unrelated to the gender stereotypicality or gender composition of the field, but that support, fit (i.e., congruence between the interests of the individual and occupation), and personality affect engagement in these behaviours. Implications for enhancing the experiences of women in STEM fields as well as for social identity-related research more broadly are discussed. Practitioner pointsIndividuals may differ in how they choose to address stigmatization at work, based on their personality and fit with the position.

The NIH has supported the need for research to address sex differences. We evaluated female enrollment in substance abuse structural brain imaging research and the methods used to study sex differences in substance effects.Methods: Structural brain imaging studies published through 2016 (n = 230) were evaluated for number of participants by sex and substance use status and methods used to evaluate sex differences. Temporal trends in the numbers of participants by sex and substance use status were analyzed. We evaluated how often sex effects were appropriately analyzed and the proportion of studies that found sex by substance interactions on volumetric measures.Results: Female enrollment increased over time, but remained significantly lower than male enrollment (p = 0.01), with the greatest bias for alcohol and opiate studies. 79% of studies included both sexes; however, 74% did not evaluate sex effects or used an analytic approach that precluded detection of sex by substance use interactions. 85% of studies that stratified by sex reported different substance effects on brain volumes. Only 33% of studies examining two-way interactions found significant interactions, highlighting that many studies were underpowered to detect interactions.Conclusions: Although female participation in substance use studies of brain morphometry has increased, sex disparity persists.

Are You Really the Doctor? Physician Experiences with Gendered Microaggressions from Patients,"Ahmad, SR; Ahmad, TR; Balasubramanian, V; Facente, S; Kin, C; Girod, S","Background: In contrast to physician implicit bias toward patients, bias and microaggressions from patients toward physicians have received comparatively less attention.Materials and Methods: We captured physician experiences of gendered microaggressions from patients by conducting a mixed-methods survey-based study of physicians at a single academic health care institution in May 2019. A quantitative portion assessed the frequency of gendered microaggressions (microaggression experiences [ME] score) and the association with measures of perceived impacts (job satisfaction, burnout, perceived career impacts, behavioral modifications). A one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test compared distributional frequencies of microaggressions by gender, and by gender and race. Chi-square tests measured the associations between gendered microaggressions and perceived impacts. Welch two-sample t-tests assessed differences in ME scores by rank and specialty. Linear regression assessed the association of ME scores and job satisfaction/burnout. A qualitative portion solicited anecdotal experiences, analyzed by inductive thematic analysis.Results: There were 297 completed surveys (response rate 27%). Female physicians experienced a significantly higher frequency of gendered microaggressions (p < 0.001) compared with male physicians. Microaggressions were significantly associated with job satisfaction (chi-square 6.83, p = 0.009), burnout (chi-square 8.76, p = 0.003), perceived career impacts (chi-square 18.67, p < 0.001), and behavioral modifications (chi-square 19.96, p < 0.001). Trainees experienced more microaggressions (p = 0.009) and burnout (p = 0.009) than faculty. Higher ME scores predicted statistically significant increases in burnout (p < 0.0001) and reduced job satisfaction (p = 0.02). Twelve microaggressions themes emerged from the qualitative responses, including role questioning and assumption of inexperience. The frequency of microaggressions did not vary significantly by race; however, qualitative responses described race as a factor.Conclusions: Physicians experience gendered microaggressions from patients, which may influence job satisfaction, burnout, career perceptions, and behavior.

Investigating the mediating effect of Uber's sexual harassment case on its brand: Does it matter?,"Griffith, DA; van Esch, P; Trittenbach, M","Following a barrage of serious allegations regarding a corporate culture that engendered sexual harassment, and discrimination, Uber lost a number of senior executives including its CEO. The phenomenon begs the question as to how much the scandals have affected the popular brand. The purpose of this study is to investigate consumer attitudes towards sexual harassment at Uber and the effects of anger about the scandal on Uber's brand popularity. Investigating such issues at a high profile service based organization highlights the nuances of employee and consumer attitudes and behaviors in the new technology-driven sharing economy. Participants (n = 201) were recruited through an online survey platform. Regarding factors affecting Uber's brand popularity, the findings of this study reveal that inequitable treatment by Uber negatively affects brand popularity, while consumer attachment to Uber positively affects Uber's brand popularity. Regarding the mediating effect of 'Acceptance of Sexual Harassment at Uber' on brand popularity, the results show that acceptance of sexual harassment only mediates the relationship between consumers' attachment toward Uber and its brand popularity. Analysis further revealed that the sexual harassment case will not be as damaging as many people initially predicted. This study will assist managers who work in various sharing economy industries and those with devout followers, such as Uber and AirBnB, on how to recover from a scandal.",2018,,JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES,43,,111-118,WOS:000434834700013,10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.03.007,,#465,Griffith 2018,"",""
The role of blogs in restoring the self-integrity of women victims of intimate partner sexual violence,"Watanabe, CYV; Diniz, EH; Scornavacca, E","Purpose This paper aims to identify the role of blogs in helping women victims of intimate partner sexual violence to restore their self-integrity. Design/methodology/approach The authors' research uses an interpretive stance, supported by motivational and ""self"" theories to analyze 33 blogs reporting the experiences of women in Brazil who suffered sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. Findings This study identifies the reasons why women who suffer violence from intimate partners write blog posts. It also develops an analytical framework that bridges the gap between the design and use of IT-artifacts and the context of sexual violence from an intimate partner. Women who suffer violence from intimate partners look for blogs in order to find a safe space for expression, a knowledge hub and a social support network. Blogs play a pivotal role in supporting the journey of reconstructing their self-integrity. Research limitations/implications The results help to understand the role of blogs in helping victims in vulnerable situations trying to restore their self-integrity. It also contributes to improve the design and functionality of such platforms as an important resource for social support networks. Practical implications This study shows the positive impact of blogs as a tool to support victims in the process of restoring their self-integrity.

Women Family Physicians: A Career in Academic Family Medicine an example from Turkey,"Unluoglu, I; Saatci, E; Akpinar, E","When the first universities opened in Europe in the 12th century, they were, with few exceptions, open for men only. It was not until the 19Th century that most European countries opened their academic institutions to female students and female teachers. At present, women occupy approximately one third of the academic posts in Turkey. Medical field is the third preferred area for women in Turkey. It is supposed that 30% of all physicians and almost half of 100,000 academic personnel in Turkey are female. However, the percentage of women decreases as the rank increases. Of residents, 47% are women whereas 35% of assistant professors, 31,6% of associate professors and 27.4% of full professors is women, The first academic tenure in family medicine was in 1994. By 15 March 2012, there are 82 associate professors and 16 full professors in family medicine. Of 82 associate professors, 46% (38) and of 16 full professors 25% (4) are women. Changing the environment of academic medicine could enhance career satisfaction and success for both women and men. Medical schools should carefully examine their environment for gender equity in promotion and compensation. Educators have an obligation to medical students and residents to develop their knowledge and skills, including those related to career development, for effectively practicing medicine. Best possible care in family medicine requires gender competent professionals who understand the cultural, social and political determinants of health and can respond effectively to them.",2015,,FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE REVIEW,17,1,48-53,WOS:000216557600011,,,#467,Unluoglu 2015,"",""

Female victims and female perpetrators: medical students' narratives of gender dynamics and professionalism dilemmas,"Shaw, MK; Chandratilake, M; Ho, MJ; Rees, CE; Monrouxe, LV","Medicine is a gendered discipline, in which women, both as patients and practitioners, have often held subordinate positions. The reproduction of dominant gender biases in the medical setting can negatively impact the professional development of medical students and the wellbeing of patients. In this analysis of medical students' narratives of professionalism dilemmas, we explore students' experiences of gender bias in hospital settings. Seventy-one students participated in 12 group interviews, where they discussed witnessing or participating in various activities that they thought were professionalism lapses. Within the dataset, 21 narratives had a distinctly gendered component broadly pertaining to patient dignity and safety dilemmas, informed consent issues, and female student abuse. Interestingly, perpetrators of such acts were commonly female healthcare professionals and educators. Although students recognized such acts as professionalism lapses and often expressed concern for patient wellbeing, students did not intervene or report such acts due to hierarchical cultural contexts, and at times even reproduced the discriminatory behavior they were criticizing. This raises concerns about medical students' professionalism development and the extent to which gender bias is ingrained within particular medical systems. The normalization of disrespectful and abusive treatment of female patients poses immediate and future consequences to the wellbeing and safety of women. Furthermore, the same socio-cultural values that sustain these acts may account for perpetrators often being women themselves as they strive to overcome their subordinate position within medicine.",2020,,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,25,2,299-319,WOS:000531702200005,10.1007/s10459-019-09919-z,,#470,Shaw 2020,"",""

Using comparative administrative law, we develop a typology of environments academic mothers navigate, reflecting national and cultural differences. We investigate the historical, cultural, and structural factors perpetuating this inequity, highlighting biases and discrimination faced by academic mothers. Entrenched institutional structures and complacent cultural norms exacerbate their systemic oppression. Normalizing motherhood in academia, from graduate students to university presidents, requires new laws, policies, programs, and expectations that create strong legal protections and favorable institutional policies.

Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women's attitudes and their choice to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM.

Female representation of Canadian General Surgeons has not been evaluated in recent years in the literature. The objectives of this study were to assess gender trends in applicants to Canadian General Surgery residency programs and practicing general surgeons and subspecialists.Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed gender data for residency applicants ranking General Surgery as their first-choice discipline from publicly-available annual Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) R-1 match reports from 1998 to 2021. Aggregate gender data for practicing female physicians in General Surgery and related subspecialties, including Pediatric Surgery, obtained from annual Canadian Medical Association (CMA) census from 2000 to 2019 was also analysed.Results: There was a significant increase in the proportion of female applicants from 34% in 1998 to 67% in 2021 (p < 0.001) and of successfully matched candidates from 39% to 68% (p = 0.002) from 1998 to 2021.

Evaluating the prevalence and quality of conference codes of conduct,"Foxx, AJ; Barak, RS; Lichtenberger, TM; Richardson, LK; Rodgers, AJ; Williams, EW","Efforts to increase inclusion in science face multiple barriers, including cultural and social behaviors in settings such as academic conferences. Conferences are beneficial, but the culture can promote inequities and power differentials that harm historically underrepresented groups. Science suffers when conference culture propagates exclusion and discrimination that leads to attrition of scientists. Codes of conduct represent a tool to shift conference culture to better support diverse scientists and clearly detail unacceptable behaviors. We examined the prevalence and content of codes of conduct at biology conferences in the United States and Canada. We highlight how codes of conduct address issues of sexual misconduct and identity-based discrimination. Surprisingly, only 24% of the 195 surveyed conferences had codes. Of the conferences with codes, 43% did not mention sexual misconduct and 17% did not mention identity-based discrimination. Further, 26% of these conferences failed to include a way to report violations of the code and 35% lacked consequences for misconduct. We found that larger and national conferences are more likely to have codes than smaller (P = 0.04) and international or regional (P = 0.03) conferences. Conferences that lack codes risk creating and perpetuating negative environments that make underrepresented groups feel unwelcome, or worse, actively cause harm. We recommend that conferences have codes that are easily accessible, explicitly address identity-based discrimination and sexual misconduct, provide channels for anonymous impartial reporting, and contain clear consequences.

The cost of social influence: Own-gender and gender-stereotype social learning biases in adolescents and adults,"Cunningham, SJ; Hutchison, J; Ellis, N; Hezelyova, I; Wood, LA","Pervasive gender gaps in academic subject and career choices are likely to be underpinned by social influences, including gender stereotypes of competence in academic and career domains (e.g., men excel at engineering, women excel at care), and model-based social learning biases (i.e., selective copying of particular individuals). Here, we explore the influence of gender stereotypes on social learning decisions in adolescent and adult males and females. Participants (Exp 1: N = 69 adolescents; Exp 2: N = 265 adults) were presented with 16 difficult multiple-choice questions from stereotypically feminine (e.g., care) and masculine (e.g., engineering) domains. The answer choices included the correct response and three incorrect responses paired with a male model, a female model, or no model. Participants' gender stereotype knowledge and endorsement were measured, and adolescents (Exp. 1) listed their academic subject choices. As predicted, there was a bias towards copying answers paired with a model (Exp.1: 74%, Exp. 2: 65% ps < .001). This resulted in less success than would be expected by chance (Exp. 1: 12%, Exp. 2: 16% ps < .001), demonstrating a negative consequence of social information. Adults (Exp 2) showed gender stereotyped social learning biases; they were more likely to copy a male model in masculine questions and a female model in feminine questions (p = .012). However, adolescents (Exp 1) showed no evidence of this stereotype bias; rather, there was a tendency for male adolescents to copy male models regardless of domain (p = .004). This own-gender bias was not apparent in female adolescents. In Exp 1, endorsement of masculine stereotypes was positively associated with selecting more own-gender typical academic subjects at school and copying significantly more male models in the male questions.

Given the risks of reporting sexual violence, discrimination, or harassment, it is important to understand how women in medicine use platforms like Twitter to publicly discuss their experiences. With such knowledge, the profession can use the public documentation of women in medicine for transformative change.MethodUsing reflexive thematic analysis, 7,983 tweets (posted between November 2017 and January 2020) associated with #WomenInMedicine, #MeTooMedicine, and #TimesUpHC were systematically analyzed in 2020-2022, iteratively moving from describing their content, to identifying thematic patterns, to conceptualizing the purpose the tweets appeared to serve.ResultsThe Twitter engagement of women in medicine was likened to ""holding beacons of light to shine in the corners [harassers] are hoping to keep dark,"" both reinforcing the message that ""gender bias is alive and well"" and calling for a ""complete transformation in how we approach"" the problem. The tweets of women in medicine primarily seemed aimed at disrupting complacency; encouraging bystanders to become allies; challenging stereotypes about women in medicine; championing individual women leaders, peers, and trainees; and advocating for reporting mechanisms and policies to ensure safety and accountability across medical workplaces.ConclusionsWomen in medicine appeared to use Twitter for a host of reasons: for amplification, peer support, advocacy, and seeking accountability. By sharing their experiences publicly, women in medicine seemed to make a persuasive argument that time is up, providing would-be allies with supporting evidence of sexual violence, discrimination, and harassment. Their tweets suggest a roadmap for what is needed to achieve gender equity, ensure that lack of awareness is no longer an excuse, and ask bystanders to grapple with why women's accounts continue to be overlooked, ignored, or dismissed and how they will support women moving forward.",2024,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,99,12,1405-1412,WOS:001367206600014,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005828,,#488,Ladonna 2024,"",""
Mental Health and Substance Use Factors Associated with Sexual Violence Victimization and Perpetration in University Samples: A Meta-Analysis,"Astle, S; McAllister, P; Spencer, C; Rivas-Koehl, M; Toews, M; Anders, K","IntroductionUsing the biopsychosocial model, we explored the mental health and substance use factors associated with sexual violence (SV) victimization and perpetration among U.S. college students and compared the differences in strength of these correlates by gender, SV perpetration vs. victimization, and type of SV. This uniquely contributes to the existing literature by (a) focusing on mental health and substance use correlates of SV among college students, (b) including both SV victimization and perpetration, and (c) comparing the strength of correlates by gender, perpetration vs. victimization, and type of SV.MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis of 101 studies meeting inclusion criteria of U.S. college samples published between January 2000 and April 2019 and calculated Q-statistics to compare differences in strength of correlates.ResultsNine mental health factors were positively associated with SV victimization (e.g., suicidal ideation). SV victimization and perpetration were positively associated with substance use. No significant differences were found comparing strength of correlate by gender or perpetration vs. victimization experience. PTSD, drug use, and alcohol were more strongly associated with certain types of SV than others.ConclusionsIn association with SV, mental health and substance use are serious considerations for individuals and organizations serving college students.Policy ImplicationsIt is important for these institutions to respond to reports of SV in a trauma-informed way, increase the accessibility and quality of on-campus mental health services available to SV survivors of all genders, and make the campus community aware of the resources are available.",2024,,SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY,21,1,388-399,WOS:001004120200002,10.1007/s13178-023-00830-2,,#489,Astle 2024,"",""
Technology-Facilitated Stalking and Unwanted Sexual Messages/Images in a College Campus Community: The Role of Negative Peer Support,"DeKeseredy, WS; Schwartz, MD; Harris, B; Woodlock, D; Nolan, J; Hall-Sanchez, A","Researchers have accumulated much social scientific knowledge about the scope, distribution, causes, and outcomes of the physical and sexual abuse of female students in North American institutions of higher learning. However, surveys of technology-facilitated stalking and the dissemination of unwanted sexual messages/images in college campus communities are in short supply. The few that have been conducted do not identify key sociological risk factors associated with these two electronic forms of victimization. This paper, then, has two objectives: (1) to examine the influence of two types of negative peer support and (2) to determine if being the target of technology-facilitated stalking and receiving unwanted sexual messages/images are associated with female students' intimate partner violence and sexual assault experiences. The results confirm that the two variants of negative peer support examined in this study are significant predictors of digital victimization and that such abuse is strongly associated with intimate partner violence and sexual assault.",2019,,SAGE OPEN,9,1,,WOS:000458819300001,10.1177/2158244019828231,,#490,DeKeseredy 2019,"",""
Experiences of the gender climate in clinical training - a focus group study among Swedish medical students,"Kristoffersson, E; Andersson, J; Bengs, C; Hamberg, K","Background: Research shows that medical education is characterized by unequal conditions for women and men, but there is a lack of qualitative studies investigating the social processes that enable and maintain gender inequalities that include both male and female students. In this focus group study, we therefore explored male as well as female medical students' experiences of the gender climate - i.e., how beliefs, values, and norms about gender were communicated - during clinical training and how the students dealt with these experiences.Methods: Focus group interviews were conducted with 24 medical students (nine men) at Umea University, Sweden. The interviews were structured around personal experiences in clinical training where the participants perceived that gender had mattered. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.Results: The students described gender-stereotyped expectations, discriminatory treatment, compliments, comments, and demeaning jargon. Female students gave more personal and varied examples than the men. The students' ways of handling their experiences were marked by efforts to fit in, for example, by adapting their appearance and partaking in the prevailing jargon. They felt dependent on supervisors and staff, and due to fear of repercussions they kept silent and avoided unpleasant situations and people rather than challenging humiliating jargon or supervisors who were behaving badly.Conclusions: Everyday communication of gender beliefs combined with students' adaptation to stereotyped expectations and discrimination came across as fundamental features through which unequal conditions for male and female students are reproduced and maintained in the clinic. Because they are in a dependent position, it is often difficult for students to challenge problematic gender attitudes. The main responsibility for improvements, therefore, lies with medical school leadership who need to provide students and supervisors with knowledge about gendered processes, discrimination, and sexism and to organize reflection groups about the gender climate in order to improve students' opportunities to discuss their experiences, and hopefully find ways to protest and actively demand change.",2016,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,16,,,WOS:000386329100002,10.1186/s12909-016-0803-1,,#491,Kristoffersson 2016,"",""
"Global Prevalence and Impact of Hostility, Discrimination, and Harassment in the Cardiology Workplace","Sharma, G; Douglas, PS; Hayes, SN; Mehran, R; Rzeszut, A; Harrington, RA; Poppas, A; Walsh, MN; Singh, T; Parekh, R; Blumenthal, RS; Mehta, LS","BACKGROUND Discrimination and emotional and sexual harassment create a hostile work environment (HWE). The global prevalence of HWE in cardiology is unknown, as is its impact.OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate emotional harassment, discrimination, and sexual harassment experienced by cardiologists and its impact on professional satisfaction and patient interactions worldwide. METHODS The American College of Cardiology surveyed cardiologists from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, the European Union, the Middle East, Oceana, and North, Central, and South America. Demographics, practice information, and HWE were tabulated and compared, and their impact was assessed. The p values were calculated using the chi-square, Fisher exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis determined the association of characteristics with HWE and its subtypes.RESULTS Of 5,931 cardiologists (77% men; 23% women), 44% reported HWE. Higher rates were found among women (68% vs. 37%; odds ratio [OR]: 3.58 vs. men), Blacks (53% vs. 43%; OR: 1.46 vs. Whites), and North Americans (54% vs. 38%; OR: 1.90 vs. South Americans). Components of HWE included emotional harassment (29%; n = 1,743), discrimination (30%; n = 1,750), and sexual harassment (4%; n = 221), and they were more prevalent among women: emotional harassment (43% vs. 26%), discrimination (56% vs. 22%), and sexual harassment (12% vs. 1%). Gender was the most frequent cause of discrimination (44%), followed by age (37%), race (24%), religion (15%), and sexual orientation (5%). HWE adversely affected professional activities with colleagues (75%) and patients (53%). Multivariate analysis showed that women (OR: 3.39; 95% confidence interval: 2.97 to 3.86; p < 0.001) and cardiologists early in their career (OR: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 1.43; p < 0.001) had the highest odds of experiencing HWE.CONCLUSIONS There is a high global prevalence of HWE in cardiology, including discrimination, emotional harassment, and sexual harassment. HWE has an adverse effect on professional and patient interactions, thus confirming concerns about well-being and optimizing patient care. Institutions and practices should prioritize combating HWE.

Climate Perceptions and Identity Interference Among Undergraduate Women in STEM: The Protective Role of Gender Identity,"Settles, IH; O'Connor, RC; Yap, SCY","In a study of 639 female undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors, we found that the relation between a negative academic climate and more interference between identities as women and as scientists, and lower science performance perceptions, was mediated by lower psychological well-being. We also found partial support for gender identity (centrality, private regard, and public regard) as a buffer of the link between climate/interference and psychological well-being. Specifically, gender centrality buffered the link between identity interference and well-being. Gender public regard buffered the association of both negative climate and interference with well-being, and gender private regard exacerbated the link between interference and well-being. We discuss these results in terms of the benefits that gender identification may provide for women in STEM and suggest that educators create networks for women in STEM, while working to reduce sexism and improve academic climates.

Double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science: Women of color face greater risks of gendered and racial harassment,"Clancy, KBH; Lee, KMN; Rodgers, EM; Richey, C","Women generally, and women of color specifically, have reported hostile workplace experiences in astronomy and related fields for some time. However, little is known of the extent to which individuals in these disciplines experience inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault. We hypothesized that the multiple marginality of women of color would mean that they would experience a higher frequency of inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault in the astronomical and planetary science workplace. We conducted an internet-based survey of the workplace experiences of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists between 2011 and 2015 and found support for this hypothesis. In this sample, in nearly every significant finding, women of color experienced the highest rates of negative workplace experiences, including harassment and assault. Further, 40% of women of color reported feeling unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender or sex, and 28% of women of color reported feeling unsafe as a result of their race. Finally, 18% of women of color, and 12% of white women, skipped professional events because they did not feel safe attending, identifying a significant loss of career opportunities due to a hostile climate.

Therefore, we aimed in this study to assess the influencing and challenging factors among female physicians in Saudi Arabia.Methods: We approached 552 female physicians, including 29 (5.2%) urologists and 523 (94.7%) non-urologists. A cross-sectional survey was carried out, which included five sections and 46 items to assess and compare the perspectives of (urologists and non-urologists regarding influencing factors to choose urology, challenges toward applying to urology, and challenges during and after urology residency. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Responses were presented as frequencies and percentages, while associations were studied using the Chi-squared test/Fisher's exact test.

Among both cohorts, the most influencing factors in choosing urology were the diversity of practice and urological procedures (p =0.002, p<0.001). There were no social barriers or challenges when applying for urology residency (p<0.001). Overall, the majority of female urologists reported a high level of agreement that they have more time to work at the clinic (55.2%), they are satisfied as they are currently being urologists (75.8%), satisfied with their current lifestyle (72.6%).

Gender Differences in Resources and Negotiation Among Highly Motivated Physician-Scientists,"Holliday, E; Griffith, KA; De Castro, R; Stewart, A; Ubel, P; Jagsi, R","Resources, including space, equipment, funding, personnel, and protected time, are essential in academic medical careers. Negotiation often plays a key role in the distribution of these resources.This study explored gender differences in resources, negotiation behaviors, and negotiation outcomes in a sample of career development awardees.Postal survey of a cohort of 1,708 clinician-researchers with responses from 1,275 (75 % response rate).Researchers who received NIH K08 or K23 awards between 2006 and 2009.We analyzed gender differences in resources, negotiation behaviors, and negotiation outcomes, using regression models adjusted for race, K award type, K award year, degree, academic rank, specialty, and institutional funding.Over one-fifth of respondents reported inadequate access to research space and one-third had asked for increased space or equipment.

"Gender, Justice and Deliberation: Why Women Don't Influence Peacemaking","Kostovicova, D; Paskhalis, T","Scholars have pinpointed that women's underrepresentation in peacemaking results in gendered outcomes that do not address women's needs and interests. Despite recent increased representation at the negotiating table, women still have a limited influence on peacemaking outcomes. We propose that differences in female and male speeches reflected in the gendered patterns in discourse during peacemaking explain how women's influence is curtailed. We examine women's speaking behavior in transitional justice debates in the post-conflict Balkans. Applying multimethod quantitative text analysis to over half a million words in multiple languages, we analyze structural and thematic speech patterns. We find that men's domination of turn-taking and the absence of topics reflecting women's needs and interests lead to a gendered outcome. The sequences of men talking after men are longer than those of women talking after women, which restricts women's deliberative space and opportunities to develop and sustain arguments that reflect their concerns. We find no evidence that women's limited influence is driven by lower deliberative quality of their speeches.

A psychometric evaluation of the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale,"Parker, RB; Parker, PD; Larkin, T; Cockburn, J","Background: Gender bias within medical education is gaining increasing attention. However, valid and reliable measures are needed to adequately address and monitor this issue. This research conducts a psychometric evaluation of a short multidimensional scale that assesses medical students' awareness of gender bias, beliefs that gender bias should be addressed, and experience of gender bias during medical education.Methods: Using students from the University of Wollongong, one pilot study and two empirical studies were conducted. The pilot study was used to scope the domain space (n = 28). This initial measure was extended to develop the Gender Bias in Medical Education Scale (GBMES). For Study 1 (n = 172), confirmatory factor analysis assessed the construct validity of the three-factor structure (awareness, beliefs, experience) and enabled deletion of redundant items. Study 2 (n = 457) tested the generalizability of the refined scale to a new sample. Combining Study 1 and 2, invariance testing for program of study and gender was explored. The relationship of the GBMES to demographic and gender politics variables was tested. The results were analyzed in R using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple-Indicator-Multiple-Indicator-Cause models.Results: After analysis of the responses from the original 16-item GBMES (Study 1), a shortened measure of ten items fitted the data well (RMSEA = .063; CFI = .965; TLI = .951; Mean R-square of items = 58.6 %; reliability: .720-.910) and was found to generalize to a new sample in Study 2 (RMSEA = .068; CFI =.952; TLI = .933; Mean R-square of items = 55.9 %; reliability:.711-.892). The GBMES was found to be invariant across studies, gender, and program of study. Female students and those who supported gender equality had greater agreement for each of the factors. Likewise, postgraduate students reported higher scores on experience of gender bias than undergraduate students.Conclusion: The GBMES provides a validated short multidimensional measure for use in research and policy. Given its good reliability across different target populations and its concise length, the GBMES has much potential for application in research and education to assess students' attitudes towards gender bias.",2016,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,16,,,WOS:000384494500002,10.1186/s12909-016-0774-2,,#502,Parker 2016,"",""
Sexual Harassment Prevalence Among OBGYN Trainees and Cultural Climate of their Training Programs: Result From a Nationwide Survey,"Menhaji, K; Pan, SPN; Hardart, A","OBJECTIVE: Sexual harassment has many short-and long-term consequences and greatly impacts the clinical work environment, job satisfaction, job performance, and mental wellbeing of the individual. Data on preva-lence of sexual harassment in a women-majority field such as Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) are lim-ited. This national cross-sectional study sought to deter-mine the prevalence of sexual harassment among OBGYN trainees in the United States (U.S.) and assess the associated departmental cultural climate.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This study was a cross-sectional, anonymous, voluntary, national survey of OBGYN residents and fellows in the U.S. conducted from May 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. The validated Sexual Experience Questionnaire was administered via an online survey. Trainees were also queried regarding well-being, work satisfaction, and departmental/institutional reporting structure. Demographic data were also gath-ered. The main outcome was prevalence of sexual harassment among U.S. OBGYN trainees. RESULTS: An email including the survey link was distrib-uted to 1473 OBGYN trainees from 60 programs; 366 completed it (24.8% response rate). The mean age of sur-vey respondents was 30.5 (SD 2.9) years. The majority of respondents were women (86%), White (64.1%), and residents (PGY 1-4, 80.2%). The prevalence of sexual harassment among respondents was 69.1% (69.6% of men and 68.7% of women). The prevalence of sexual harassment by race/ethnicity was: Hispanic/Latina 75.0%, White 68.7%, Asian 68.6%, and Black 47.4% train-ees. The majority of respondents' program directors were women (66.4%, 227/342) and the majority of department chairs were men (68.9%, 235/341). The prevalence of sexual harassment did not differ based on the gender of the respondents' program directors and chairs (p-value 0.93).CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of sexual harassment among U.S. OBGYN trainees.

Systematic review of academic bullying in medical settings: dynamics and consequences,"Averbuch, T; Eliya, Y; Van Spall, HGC","Purpose To characterise the dynamics and consequences of bullying in academic medical settings, report factors that promote academic bullying and describe potential interventions. Design Systematic review. Data sources We searched EMBASE and PsycINFO for articles published between 1 January 1999 and 7 February 2021. Study selection We included studies conducted in academic medical settings in which victims were consultants or trainees. Studies had to describe bullying behaviours; the perpetrators or victims; barriers or facilitators; impact or interventions. Data were assessed independently by two reviewers. Results We included 68 studies representing 82 349 respondents. Studies described academic bullying as the abuse of authority that impeded the education or career of the victim through punishing behaviours that included overwork, destabilisation and isolation in academic settings. Among 35 779 individuals who responded about bullying patterns in 28 studies, the most commonly described (38.2% respondents) was overwork. Among 24 894 individuals in 33 studies who reported the impact, the most common was psychological distress (39.1% respondents). Consultants were the most common bullies identified (53.6% of 15 868 respondents in 31 studies). Among demographic groups, men were identified as the most common perpetrators (67.2% of 4722 respondents in 5 studies) and women the most common victims (56.2% of 15 246 respondents in 27 studies). Only a minority of victims (28.9% of 9410 victims in 25 studies) reported the bullying, and most (57.5%) did not perceive a positive outcome. Facilitators of bullying included lack of enforcement of institutional policies (reported in 13 studies), hierarchical power structures (7 studies) and normalisation of bullying (10 studies). Studies testing the effectiveness of anti-bullying interventions had a high risk of bias. Conclusions Academic bullying commonly involved overwork, had a negative impact on well-being and was not typically reported. Perpetrators were most commonly consultants and men across career stages, and victims were commonly women. Methodologically robust trials of anti-bullying interventions are needed.

Moral Injury as a Mediator of the Associations Between Sexual Harassment and Mental Health Symptoms and Substance Use Among Women Veterans,"Hamrick, HC; Ehlke, SJ; Davies, RL; Higgins, JM; Naylor, J; Kelley, ML","Moral injury is an array of symptoms theorized to develop in response to morally injurious events, defined as events that challenge one's core moral beliefs and expectations about the self, others, and world. Recent measures of moral injury have distinguished self-directed moral injury (e.g., moral injury symptoms that emerge following the perpetration of morally injurious events) from other-directed moral injury, the symptoms of which are believed to stem from one's response to actions that others have committed (e.g., within-rank violence, failures of leadership, and acts of betrayal committed by trusted others or institutions). Using a convenience sample of 154 primarily former military women, the present study examined if other-directed moral injury symptoms (e.g., anger, betrayal, and mistrust) associated with military experience would mediate the association between military sexual harassment and mental health and substance abuse symptoms. Results demonstrated that 85.8% (n = 127) of the of this sample of women veterans reported experiencing sexual harassment during their military service. Using a single mediation model, we further demonstrated that other-directed moral injury mediated the association between sexual harassment experience and mental health symptoms. Given the percentage of women veterans who reported sexual harassment, these results suggest that additional training for military members, and particularly, military leaders, is necessary to begin to reduce sexual harassment. In addition, mental health providers who work with current and former military members should consider how other-directed moral injury may be associated with mental health symptoms among women veterans who have experienced sexual harassment while in the military.",2022,,JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,37,11-12,NP10007-NP10035,WOS:000649156600001,10.1177/0886260520985485,,#507,Hamrick 2022,"",""
Discrimination and Abuse Among Healthcare Workers from Patients and their Relatives at a Tertiary Hospital in Kenya,"Ebrahim, FA; Shah, JS; Sharma, K; Kunyiha, N; Korom, R; Ali, SK","Discrimination and abuse of healthcare workers (HCWs) by patients and their relatives remains a pressing and prevalent problem in various healthcare settings, negatively affecting professional outcomes.

Email invitations were sent, and the survey was in English, and the data was collected through and online survey. Discrimination based on gender was reported by 24.9% of all HCWs; 39.9% of doctors, 17.2% of nurses, and 10.9% of allied staff whereas racial discrimination was reported by 28.8% of all HCWs; 49.0% of doctors, 18.9% of nurses, and 8.9% of allied staff. Verbal or emotional abuse was the most common form of abuse and was reported by 56.8% of all HCWs while physical abuse was reported by 4.9% of all HCWs. For those that reported discrimination based on gender, 77.4% reported patient and their family members as the main source, whereas 81.2% of those that reported discrimination based on race reported the main source was from patient and their family members.

"Disparities in Perpetrators, Locations, and Reports of Victimization for Sexual and Gender Minority Adolescents","Kaufman, TML; Baams, L","Purpose: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are more likely to become victims of bullying and harassment than heterosexual, cisgender adolescents, but little is known about the contextual details of these victimization experiences. This study aims to examine by whom and where adolescents are bullied or harassed, to whom adolescents report such victimization, and whether these experiences differ between SGM and heterosexual, cisgender adolescents.Methods: Participants in this nationally representative study were 29,879 students (mean age = 14.1) from 136 Dutch middle/high schools across grades 7-12 (14.5% sexual minority, 2.7% gender minority) who completed a survey about their school-based experiences.Results: Perpetrators of victimization of SGM students were more often teachers and school staff compared with heterosexual, cisgender adolescents. Furthermore, SGM students experienced victimization in private locations (in the rest- or changing rooms/parking lots, at home), more often than heterosexual, cisgender students. Finally, SGM students felt less safe than their heterosexual, cisgender peers to report these experiences to teachers or parents, and were more likely to report their experiences to the police or the school janitor. SGM students who reported victimization experiences were less likely to receive support: the problems were less often acted on and persisted more often than those of heterosexual, cisgender students.Conclusions: SGM adolescents are not only victimized more often, but also by different perpetrators (teachers, other school staff) and in more private places. Their victimization is also less likely to be recognized or acted on by those responsible for adolescent's safety: teachers or parents. (C) 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Rationalizing gender inequality at scientific research organizations A reproduction of the Indian socio-cultural context,"Gupta, N","Purpose - It is well-known that women scientists are few in numbers in prestigious research organizations and still fewer in leadership positions. The purpose of this article is to analyze how organizational gender inequality is rationalized by scientists so as to highlight how discourse on equality reproduces gender at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach - Data was collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews with the scientists in four research laboratories dealing with medicinal drugs and chemical substances. It uses discourse analysis by Foucault as a theoretical lens to examine how gender inequality is rationalized and the power relations behind it. It adopts the perspective that socio-cultural beliefs form the basis of gendered practices in organizations. Findings - It finds that the scientists refuse to blame the organization for inequalities by delinking gender issues from the organizational domain. This delinking occurs through rationalizing gender inequality as ""social"", through separating informal behavior from the ""system"" and perceiving women as ""privileged"". Such discourses while keeping intact the rationality and meritocracy of the organizations/institutions, reproduce the ideological ""public-private dichotomy"" and the male dominance at the workplace. Practical implications - The findings indicate the need for extensive studies in India highlighting how gender is done in organizations, exploring men's role in undoing gender and government initiatives to create a climate of gender equality. Originality/value - It highlights how discourse on gender equality/inequality at the workplace manifests dominance of men and represents an intersection of Indian social, organizational and institutional contexts at workplace. It also calls into question the applicability of the western concepts of ""individualization"" and ""gender fatigue"" to the Indian context.",2020,,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,39,6,689-706,WOS:000524822500001,10.1108/EDI-09-2018-0168,,#512,Gupta 2020,"",""

Methods We implemented a workshop to prepare pre-clinical medical/dental students to recognize and respond to microaggressions. Participants in three cohorts from 2018 to 2020 completed pre- and post-workshop surveys assessing the prevalence of exposure to clinical microaggressions and the workshop's effect on mitigating commonly perceived barriers to addressing microaggressions. Results Of 461 first-year medical and dental students who participated, 321 (69.6%) provided survey responses. Over 80% of students reported experiencing microaggressions, with women and URM students over-represented. After the workshop, participants reported significant reductions in barriers to addressing microaggressions and discrimination, including recognizing incidents, uncertainty of what to say or do, lack of allies, lack of familiarity with institutional policies, and uncertainty of clinical relevance. The workshop was similarly effective in-person and virtual formats.

"Sex, Drugs, and TBI: The Role of Sex in Substance Abuse Related to Traumatic Brain Injuries","Oliverio, R; Karelina, K; Weil, ZM","Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a significant public health problem costing billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost productivity while simultaneously reducing the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Substance abuse is closely interconnected with TBI, as intoxicated individuals are at a greater risk of suffering brain injuries, and TBI may serve as a risk factor for the subsequent development of substance use disorders. There are also prominent sex differences in the etiology, epidemiology, and consequences of TBI. For instance, men are more likely to be injured on sporting fields or in auto accidents, while women are disproportionately likely to suffer TBI associated with intimate partner violence. Moreover, while men are much more likely to suffer TBI during late adolescence-young adulthood, sex differences in the incidence of TBI are much less prominent during other developmental epochs. Further, there are prominent sex differences in substance abuse biology; for example, while more men meet diagnostic criteria for substance abuse disorders, women tend to advance from casual use to addiction more quickly. In this paper, we will discuss the emerging clinical and preclinical evidence that these sex differences in TBI and substance abuse interact and may be prominent determinates of long-term outcomes.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,11,,,WOS:000583259500001,10.3389/fneur.2020.546775,,#516,Oliverio 2020,"",""

Sexual Violence Against Female Children in Liberia: A Cross-Sectional Study of Statutory Rape Prevalence Rates Related to Correlates of Gender Equity,"Hanson-DeFusco, J; Dunn, WN; Smith, EG Jr","In recent decades, the Government of Liberia (GOL) and international partners have prioritized combatting child sexual abuse, including illicit and harmful early sexual practices involving girls and adult men. Previous studies indicate high rape rates among Liberian female populations, yet more research on specific forms of abuse is needed to better understand the magnitude of the problem. Applying Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework, this paper presents the results of a 2018 mixed-methods study of 719 Liberian young women (ages 18-35) and 493 of their parents, from urban/rural districts in Montserrado. The purpose is to contribute a large-scale representative study establishing the rate of female statutory rape and key correlates. The survey captures data measuring early sexual activity (ESA), education, socio-economic status, demographics, and knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KABs) associated with cultural ethnic customs, rural/urban settings, and gender rights. The statistical analysis indicates that 35.1% (95% CI 30.1-37.1) of Liberian women report experiencing ESA that qualifies as statutory rape under Liberian law. Age, ethnicity, location, SES, education, and most individual KABs are not correlated with lower rates (p < 0.05).

Do You See Me?

We expand research and theory on intersectional invisibility to propose that women of color vary in their degrees of nonprototypicality, and thus in their social power and their experiences of and responses to invisibility at work. We present an inductive interview study of a diverse sample of 65 women of color in the United States and Canada, who work in traditionally white and male professions. We examined how differences in race, immigration status, age, and organizational rank informed the types of invisibility they experienced and their responses to invisibility. Four forms of invisibility (erasure, homogenization, exoticization, and whitening) and three response pathways (withdrawal, approach, and pragmatism) emerged from our findings that differed according to women of color's social power. Women with less social power experienced the most invisibility and were more likely to engage in withdrawal tactics that intensified their invisibility and marginalization at work. Women with more social power experienced less invisibility and were more likely to engage in approach tactics that risked backlash. Women who understood their invisibility to be rooted in structural causes responded more pragmatically to invisibility, occasionally engaging in radical honesty to connect with others who treated them as invisible and to change their behavior.

Investigating Indian Commuters' Perceived Crime Risk on Autonomous Public Buses and Ride-Pooling Services,"Pervez, A; Marazi, NF; Majumdar, BB; Ruizhi, M; Lee, J; Sahu, PK","Autonomous vehicle technologies are anticipated to transform road transportation systems, promising enhanced traffic safety and efficiency across different modes, including public buses (PB) and ride-pooling services (RPS). However, in India, there is a growing security concern/fear of crime concerning conventional PB and RPS because of the recent rise in crimes committed on them. Moreover, the introduction of driverless modes of PB and RPS may further heighten commuters' crime concerns on such services because of the absence of a driver. Thus, this study investigates the acceptance of autonomous public buses (APB) and autonomous ride-pooling services (ARPS), as well as how commuters' characteristics influence the perceived risks of crime and victimization and their willingness to use the modes. To achieve this, a stated preference survey was designed and conducted across India. The survey resulted in 732 complete responses. The results show that socioeconomic attributes, vehicle automation, and security-related measures significantly influence commuters' perceived fear of crime and willingness to use APB and ARPS in India. More specifically, young commuters demonstrate higher willingness to use APB and ARPS, while females exhibit lower willingness to use APB and ARPS. In addition, the presence of a security officer on these modes decreases commuters' concerns about crime. Moreover, travel distance is positively associated with commuters' perceived level of crime and victimization, while it has a negative relationship with their unwillingness to use APB and ARPS. APB and ARPS are yet to be introduced in India, and Indian commuters have not experienced the security concerns associated with them; thus, the results of this study can serve as the base for guideline formulation for security concerns in India. Based on the results of this study, a set of policy implications, such as female-only transit units, enhancing security measures on the automated modes, and design framework and infrastructure, were proposed. These policy implications can be instrumental in increasing the acceptability of APB and ARPS in India and other countries with similar characteristics.",2024,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,,,,WOS:001293175800001,10.1177/03611981241257514,,#521,Pervez 2024,"",""

Objective: We examine effects of sexual and generalized workplace harassment on changes in drinking behavior over the first semesters of college, and the extent to which these effects differ based on prematriculation drinking for men and women students. Method: Data derive from two waves of a longitudinal study of eight Midwestern colleges and universities. Data were collected from 2080 employed students via a Web-based survey assessing sexual and generalized workplace harassment, stressful life events, drinking to intoxication, and binge drinking prior to freshman year (fall 2011) and approximately one year later (summer to fall 2012). At baseline, lifetime drinking status, frequency of alcohol consumption, and demographics were also assessed. Results: Linear-mixed modeling indicated that employed women students who were frequent drinkers prematriculation were at risk for high levels of drinking associated with workplace harassment, while men who were nondrinkers were most at risk of increasing problem drinking over time when exposed to workplace harassment. Conclusions: Alcohol use prevention efforts directed towards employed students are needed both prior to and during college, to instruct students how to identify workplace harassment and cope in healthier ways with stressful workplace experiences. These efforts might be particularly useful in stemming problematic drinking among women who drink frequently prior to college, and preventing men who are nondrinkers upon college entry from initiating problematic drinking during subsequent enrollment years.",2017,,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,52,7,892-904,WOS:000399913400008,10.1080/10826084.2016.1267218,,#522,Rospenda 2017,"",""

Conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics may increase gender inequities, but also present an opportunity to address them. This scoping review describes and identifies gaps in the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure GEWE in humanitarian settings, and presents a dashboard that can be used by researchers, organizations and governments to identify GEWE measurement tools. Methods Scientific articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and PAIS index. Relevant non peer-reviewed literature was downloaded from the websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications on women and/or girls impacted by a humanitarian crisis in a LMIC, within 5 years of data collection, were included. Publications were double-screened in the title/abstract and full-text stages. We used a machine learning software during the title/abstract screening to increase the efficiency of the process. Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Results Our search yielded 27,197 publications and 2396 non peer-reviewed literature reports. One hundred and seventy publications were included in the final review.

Thirty-eight toolkits and questionnaires were identified in this review, of which 19 (50%) were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Sociocultural was the largest domain in number of studies and indicators in this review, with gender-based violence indicators reported in 66% of studies. Indicators of economic, human development and leadership were uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. Discussion While there has been some effort to measure GEWE in conflict-affected and other humanitarian settings, measurement has largely focused on violence and security issues.

Fleeing the Ivory Tower: Gender Differences in the Turnover Experiences of Women Faculty,"Martinez, LR; O'Brien, KR; Hebl, MR","Purpose: Prior research has established that women and men faculty have different experiences in their professional and personal lives and that academic turnover can be costly and disruptive to home institutions. However, relatively little research has examined gender differences in the antecedent events that contributed to faculty members' voluntary turnover decisions. This study aims to fill this gap. Materials and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained in two ways: by directly contacting faculty members who had voluntarily left their positions through the human resource departments at six institutions and through more wide-scale snowball sampling. The surveys, administered via paper or web based, measured the extent to which participants' experiences with harassment/discrimination, family-related issues, and recruitment/retention offers impacted their decisions to leave. Qualitative data were coded by raters into numerical values, and mean differences based on gender were assessed for these and the quantitative data. Results: Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest that female academicians reported experiencing significantly more gender-based harassment/discrimination, were much more likely to cite family-related reasons for leaving, and reported receiving significantly fewer external job offers and internal retention offers than their male counterparts.

Behind the screen: The perception-reality gap in cybersexual harassment between remote coworkers,"Navick, N; Mazur, AP; Gibbs, JL","This study examines the perception-reality gap regarding the influence of technological affordances on cybersexual harassment (CSH) between remote workers. While previous research has recognized the existence of gender stereotypes and discrimination in online spaces, little attention has been given to how technological affordances impact-or are perceived to impact-incidents of CSH. By employing a theoretical framework of technological affordances, this study reveals that users often perceive affordances differently from how they utilize them, indicating a misalignment between perception and behavior. Our analysis of interviews with 30 remote knowledge workers extends affordances theory by showing that affordances are not always applied in the ways they are perceived, and that power dynamics and structural inequalities outweigh technological affordances in shaping reporting behaviors. Addressing this perception-reality gap is crucial for developing interventions and policies that accurately reflect the realities of CSH experiences and promote a safe online work environment.",2024,,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,,,,WOS:001333981800001,10.1177/14614448241274469,,#528,Navick 2024,"",""
Street harassment is marketplace discrimination: The impact of street harassment on young female consumers' marketplace experiences,"Rosenbaum, MS; Edwards, KL; Malla, B; Adhikary, JR; Ramírez, GC","This study brings street harassment to the retailing and consumer services literature streams. Street harassment describes unwanted interactions in public spaces between strangers or customers and is often motivated by a person's gender, sexual orientation, or gender expression. To date, marketers have overlooked the occurrence of street harassment in retail establishments and consumer service domains, such as in theaters, public markets, recreational areas, and shopping malls. This work empirically demonstrates the extent to which young women in Nepal experience harassment from men in the marketplace and the various tactics they employ to lessen it. Furthermore, this research exposes the extent to which Nepali men admit to participating in verbal, physical, or visual harassment of women in various retailing and service settings.

"Programmatic engagement in diversity, equity, and inclusion in US vascular surgery training programs","Bose, S; Kowalczyk, B; Aulivola, B; Amankwah, K; Smeds, MR","Objective: Given the diversity of populations that modern healthcare professionals treat, there has been an increasing call for academic medical centers to ensure that they themselves are diverse and inclusive. Historically, this has been measured by the composition of the workforce in terms of protected categories such as race/ethnicity, gender, and disability. However, these broad categories have only poorly reflected the actual ability of organizations to engage with a diverse workforce and patient population. The diversity and engagement survey (DES) is a specifically constructed and validated instrument designed to measure the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within academic medical centers. The goal of the present study was to use the DES with vascular surgery program directors, to determine the predictors of low DEI in vascular surgery training programs.Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was sent to all program directors and assistant program directors of vascular surgery training programs (residencies and fellowships) in the United States (n = 280). The survey consisted of 18 sections with 53 questions regarding details of the respondent, demographics, programmatic information, including information on faculty and trainee diversity, the resources available to enhance DEI within the program, institutional attitudes toward employees, and the DES itself. The total score from the DES section was used to the stratify institutions, which were classified as low DEI if in the bottom 25% percentile of the overall scores or as high DEI if scoring higher. Univariate analysis was used to determine whether any important differences were present in the demographics or survey responses between the institutions scoring as low vs high DEI. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed using the demographic variables and responses to the survey questions to determine their relationship to DEI status.Results: There were a total of 102 complete responses to the survey (36.4% response rate). The proportion of women was higher (66.67%) than the men (33.30%) in the low DEI cohort, although women were only 28.4% of the overall cohort. A statistically significant difference was found between the high and low DEI institutions in the proportion of those who had responded yes, no, or preferred not to disclose whether they had experienced discrimination or hurtful comments (P < .001) with 71% of the respondents in the low DEI institutions reporting this experience compared with only 11% in high DEI institutions. Multivariate analysis also demonstrated that non-male gender (odds ratio, 5.10; P = .034) and ex-periences of discrimination (odds ratio, 6.51; P = .024) were associated with low DEI institutions.Conclusions: Non-male program directors and those who had experienced discrimination at their institution were significantly more likely to find that their institution had low DEI.

"The ""Princess Syndrome"": An Examination of Gender Harassment on a Male-Majority University Campus","Cundiff, JL","Gender harassment is prevalent in contexts where women are underrepresented and negatively stereotyped, yet instances of gender harassment are often discounted as unimportant and inconsequential. The current research presents an examination of gender harassment operating on a male-majority university campus in the form of a sex-based slur known as the ""Princess Syndrome."" Across two studies, the present research investigated the prevalence, meaning, and adverse consequences of the label. Study 1 indicated that the label was widespread at the university: 70% of participants had heard of the label, nearly half had used the label, and 1 out of 4 female participants had been targeted by the label. Inductive content analysis of open-ended responses revealed that the label was a derogatory term used to insult and degrade women by stigmatizing women as manipulative, exploitative, and stuck up. In Study 2, participants read about and rated a female student who was either labeled with the ""Princess Syndrome"" or not. Consistent with predictions, participants were more likely to discount the female student's success in an engineering course as due to external factors (e.g., luck), rated her as less competent, and were less likely to choose to work with her on a team project when she was labeled with the ""Princess Syndrome"" than when she was not labeled.

"Effectiveness of ""Shifting Boundaries"" Teen Dating Violence Prevention Program for Subgroups of Middle School Students","Taylor, BG; Mumford, EA; Stein, ND","Purpose: We examine whether the Shifting Boundaries (SB) intervention, a primary intervention to prevent youth dating violence and sexual harassment (DV/H), is differentially effective for girls compared with boys or for youth with a history of DV/H experiences.Methods: We randomly assigned SB to 30 public middle schools in New York City, enrolling 117 sixth and seventh grade classes to receive a classroom, building, combined, or neither intervention. The SB classroom intervention included six sessions emphasizing the laws/consequences of DV/H, establishing boundaries and safe relationships. The SB schoolwide/building intervention included the use of school-based restraining orders, greater faculty/security presence in unsafe ""hot spots"" mapped by students, and posters to increase DV/H awareness and reporting. Student surveys were implemented at baseline, immediately after intervention, and 6 months after intervention.Results: At 6 months after intervention, the SB building-level intervention was associated with significant reductions in the frequency of sexual harassment (SH) perpetration and victimization; the prevalence and frequency of sexual dating violence victimization; and the frequency of total dating violence victimization and perpetration. We also had one anomalous finding that the interventions were associated with an increase in the prevalence of SH victimization. These results were consistent for girls and boys, and those with or without a history of DV/H, with the one exception for those exposed to the SB building condition who had earlier reported perpetrating SH had a significantly lower frequency of perpetrating SH at the follow-up than those without such a history.Conclusions: SB can provide effective universal prevention of middle school DV/H experiences, regardless of students' prior exposure histories, and for boys and girls.

However varying research methodologies (e.g., different sexual assault definitions, measures, assessment time frames) and low response rates hamper efforts to define the scope of the problem. To illuminate the complexity of campus sexual assault, we collected survey data from a large population -based random sample of undergraduate students from Columbia University and Barnard College in New York City, using evidence based methods to maximize response rates and sample representativeness, and behaviorally specific measures of sexual assault to accurately capture victimization rates. This paper focuses on student experiences of different types of sexual assault victimization, as well as sociodemographic, social, and risk environment correlates. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were used to estimate prevalences and test associations. Since college entry, 22% of students reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual assault (defined as sexualized touching, attempted penetration [oral, anal, vaginal, other], or completed penetration). Women and gender nonconforming students reported the highest rates (28% and 38%, respectively), although men also reported sexual assault (12.5%). Across types of assault and gender groups, incapacitation due to alcohol and drug use and/or other factors was the perpetration method reported most frequently (> 50%); physical force (particularly for completed penetration in women) and verbal coercion were also commonly reported. Factors associated with increased risk for sexual assault included non-heterosexual identity, difficulty paying for basic necessities, fraternity/sorority membership, participation in more casual sexual encounters (""hook ups"") vs. exclusive/monogamous or no sexual relationships, binge drinking, and experiencing sexual assault before college. High rates of re -victimization during college were reported across gender groups. Our study is consistent with prevalence findings previously reported.

We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is fully mediated by men's adherence to normative masculine norms (e.g., aggression) and toxic disinhibition.

The current study aimed to further this area of inquiry by investigating potential consequences of street harassment, including perceptions of safety and anxiety among college women. Specifically, this study introduced and tested a mediation model in which women's experiences of street harassment may lead to less perceived safety in public spaces, specifically isolated and busy public spaces, which in turn may lead to more anxiety. Method: To examine the model, undergraduate women (N = 501) completed measures of street harassment, perceived safety, and general anxiety. Results: Most participants (57-88%) reported experiencing verbal street harassment whereas 11-33% reported experiencing sexual forms of street harassment. Significant correlations emerged among street harassment, safety perceptions in busy and isolated public settings, and anxiety. Consistent with the model, safety perceptions in isolated public settings emerged as a significant mediator of the relation between street harassment and anxiety.

Challenges that undermine the profession include inequities in advancement, high levels of burnout, reduced career duration, and elevated risk for mental health problems, including suicide. This narrative review explores whether physicians within four subpopulations represented in the workforce at levels lower than predicted from their numbers in the general population-women, racial and ethnic minorities in medicine, sexual and gender minorities, and people with disabilities-are at elevated risk for these problems, and if present, how these problems might be addressed to support patient care. In essence, the underlying question this narrative review explores is as follows: Do physician workforce disparities affect patient care? While numerous articles and high-profile reports have examined the relationship between workforce diversity and patient care, to our knowledge, this is the first review to examine the important relationship between diversity-related workforce disparities and patient care. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO Discovery Service) were searched by a librarian. Additional resources were included by authors, as deemed relevant to the investigation. Results: The initial database searches identified 440 potentially relevant articles. Articles were categorized according to subtopics, including (1) underrepresented physicians and support for vulnerable patient populations; (2) factors that could exacerbate the projected physician deficit; (3) methods of addressing disparities among underrepresented physicians to support patient care; or (4) excluded (n=155).

"Not a dream wedding: the hidden nexus between gender discrimination, climate change and child marriage","Pastén, R; Figueroa, E; Fuentes, M","Could climate change and child marriage be related? At first, it may seem unlikely, but if we consider the impact of climate change on poverty and income, the connection becomes more plausible. In this paper we use a structural equation model to investigate this relationship. Our results indicate that increased ""climate vulnerability,"" as measured by the ND-GAIN index, is associated with both a direct increase in child marriage and indirect increases due to higher poverty and gender inequality. However, since climate vulnerability is highly correlated with national economics, it is possible that poverty is the underlying factor behind both child marriage and climate vulnerability itself. When we replace climate vulnerability with climate exposure (a variable based solely on the biophysics of climate change), our results remained consistent. This supports our model's premise that climate change primarily affects child marriage through its impacts on access to resources and income, which in turn affect the main drivers of child marriage: extreme poverty and gender inequality. Our findings have broader implications, as it is likely that several negative social outcomes of climate change work through similar mechanisms, i.e., an indirect impact of climate change on social variables mediated through its previous effects on economic variables.",2024,,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,,,,WOS:001198568700003,10.1007/s10668-024-04813-0,,#541,Pastén 2024,"",""

This study aims to analyze trends in resident attrition in neurological surgery.METHODS This study followed a cohort of 1275 residents who started neurosurgical residency from 2005 to 2010. Data obtained from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) included residents who matched in neurosurgery during this time. Residents who did not finish their residency training at the program in which they started were placed into the attrition group. Residents in the attrition group were characterized by one of five outcomes: transferred neurosurgery programs; transferred to a different specialty; left clinical medicine; deceased; or unknown. A thorough internet search was conducted for residents who did not complete their training at their first neurosurgical program. Variables leading to attrition were also analyzed, including age, sex, presence of advanced degree (Ph.D.), postgraduate year (PGY), and geographical region of program.RESULTS Residents starting neurosurgical residency from 2005 to 2010 had an overall attrition rate of 10.98%. There was no statistically significant difference in attrition rates among the years (p = 0.337). The outcomes for residents in the attrition group were found to be as follows: 33.61% transferred neurosurgical programs, 56.30% transferred to a different medical specialty, 8.40% left clinical medicine, and 1.68% were deceased. It was observed that women had a higher attrition rate (18.50%) than men (10.35%). Most attrition (65.07%) occurred during PGY 1 or 2. The attrition group was also observed to be significantly older at the beginning of residency training, with a mean of 31.69 years of age compared to 29.31 in the nonattrition group (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in the attrition rates for residents with a Ph.D. (9.86%) compared to those without a Ph.D. (p = 0.472).CONCLUSIONS A majority of residents in the attrition group pursued training in different medical specialties, most commonly neurology, radiology, and anesthesiology. Factors associated with an increased rate of attrition were older age at the beginning of residency, female sex, and junior resident (PGY-1 to PGY-2).

Indicating that they themselves had not been personally subjected to ageism, the men considered age-based discrimination to be a socially distant problem. The men explained their perceived immunity to ageism in terms of their youthful attitudes and active lifestyles. The men identified three groups who they considered to be particularly vulnerable to age-based discrimination, namely women, older workers and frail elders residing in institutions. At the same time, the majority of our participants had internalised a variety of ageist and sexist stereotypes. Indeed, the men assumed that later life was inevitably a time of physical decline and dependence, and accepted as fact that older adults were grumpy, poor drivers, unable to learn new technologies and, in the case of older women, sexually unattractive. In this way, a tension existed between the men's assertion that ageism did not affect their lives and their own internalisation of ageist stereotypes. We consider our findings in relation to the theorising about ageism and hegemonic masculinity.",2016,,AGEING & SOCIETY,36,8,1757-1773,WOS:000382506300010,10.1017/S0144686X15000689,,#547,Clarke 2016,"",""
"""Don't Bother Your Pretty Little Head"": Appearance Compliments Lead to Improved Mood but Impaired Cognitive Performance","Kahalon, R; Shnabel, N; Becker, JC","We examined whether appearance compliments, despite their flattery, undermine cognitive performance. In Study 1, women participants (N = 88 Israeli university students) who wrote about past situations in which they had received appearance compliments (but not competence-related compliments) showed worse math performance than women in a control/no compliment conditionespecially if they scored high on trait self-objectification (TSO). In Study 2, men and women participants (n(women) = 73, n(men) = 75 Israeli university students) received bogus occupational evaluation feedback, which did or did not include an appearance compliment. Although appearance compliments led to mood improvement among participants with high TSO, they also undermined math performance among both women and men. Because receiving appearance compliments is a common experience for women (whereas men are typically complimented for their competencies), our findings suggest that appearance compliments serve as a mechanism that might subtly perpetuate gender inequality. For the promotion of societal gender equality, it is important that the public is aware that appearance compliments, even if meant well, may create sexist environments.

The Experience of Male Physicians with Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment: a Qualitative Study,"Farkas, AH; Scholcoff, C; Machen, JL; Kay, C; Nickoloff, S; Fletcher, KE; Jackson, JL","Background Sexual harassment and gender-based harassment are common in medicine; however, there is little in the literature regarding men's experience with gender-based and sexual harassment. Objective The objective of this study was to better understand the experience men have with sexual and gender-based harassment in medicine. Design We developed and piloted an interview guide based on a review of the literature and conducted semi-structured interviews of male physicians, from trainees to attendings, at a tertiary care facility. Participants were recruited via email between April and August of 2019. These interviews were transcribed verbatim and, using an iterative coding approach based in grounded theory, were coded and analyzed for themes. Main Results We conducted a total of 16 interviews. Five major themes were identified: (1) personal experiences of harassment, (2) witnessed harassment, (3) characterization of harassment, (4) impact of harassment, and (5) strategies for responding to harassment. The men reported experiences with sexual and gender-based harassment but were hesitant to define these encounters as such. They had minimal emotional distress from these encounters but worried about their professional reputation and lacked training for how to respond to these encounters. Many had also witnessed their female colleagues being harassed by both male patients and colleagues but did not respond to or stop the harassment when it originated from a colleague. Conclusion We found that men experience sexual harassment differently from women. Most notably, men report less emotional distress from these encounters and often do not define these events as harassment. However, similar to women, men feel unprepared to respond to episodes of harassment against themselves or others. Whether to deter sexual harassment against themselves, or, more commonly, against a female colleague, men can gain the tools to speak up and be part of the solution to sexual harassment in medicine.",2020,,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,35,8,2383-2388,WOS:000516317900012,10.1007/s11606-020-05695-4,,#550,Farkas 2020,"",""
Physician Health and Wellness,"Sect Integrative Med; McClafferty, HH; Hubbard, DK; Foradori, D; Brown, ML; Profit, J; Tawfik, DS","Physician health and wellness is a complex topic relevant to all pediatricians. Survey studies have established that pediatricians experience burnout at comparable rates to colleagues across medical specialties. Prevalence of burnout increased for all pediatric disciplines from 2011 to 2014. During that time, general pediatricians experienced a more than 10% increase in burnout, from 35.3% to 46.3%. Pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists experienced slightly higher baseline rates of burnout in 2011 and similarly increased to just under 50%. Women currently constitute a majority of pediatricians, and surveys report a 20% to 60% higher prevalence of burnout in women physicians compared with their male counterparts. The purpose of this report is to update the reader and explore approaches to pediatrician well-being and reduction of occupational burnout risk throughout the stages of training and practice. Topics covered include burnout prevalence and diagnosis; overview of national progress in physician wellness; update on physician wellness initiatives at the American Academy of Pediatrics; an update on pediatric-specific burnout and well-being; recognized drivers of burnout (organizational and individual); a review of the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, and burnout; protective factors; and components of wellness (organizational and individual).

A Social Ecological Model for Military Women's Health,"Trego, LL; Wilson, C","Background: U.S. military women's health (MWH) is influenced by unique life experiences while serving in combat and combat support roles in the armed forces. Daily accomplishment of the military mission exposes women to occupational, physical, and psychosocial factors that affect their health status. Here, we present the theoretical framework for a social ecological model (SEM) for MWH.Methods: By synthesizing the common elements of various SEMs for health, we describe the layers in the military social ecological system that are typical of the milieu of servicewomen. With the individual's knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, and physiology at the center of the model, relevant components of the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem are identified.Results: Support for the SEM-MWH can be found in all layers of the social ecological system. Distinguishing factors of the SEM-MWH include characteristics of the military environment, community, health care system, regulations and policies, and the military culture in which women live and work. Servicewomen's life experiences in the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem occur in a nested, interactive system that affects their health behaviors and their health status.Conclusions: The social ecological system of servicewomen is unique and must be fully explored and appreciated to ensure the health of women who serve. Investigation of the effects of policies throughout all layers of the SEM-MWH on the individual servicewoman is warranted. (C) 2020 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

Violence affects the lives of these populations, undermining their ability to self-care and making them more vulnerable to HIV infection. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between different types of victimization by violence and discrimination and sexual health practices of these adolescent populations in steady and casual relationships. We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the cohort of PrEP1519 project. We used the mean score of sexual health practices as our outcome and the cumulative score of discrimi-nati on (within family, community, education, religious, online and public spaces) and violence (physical, sexual and intimate partner) as our exposure variable. We performed linear regression analyses to estimate the association between exposure and outcome. We found that 90% of AMSM and 95% of ATGW experienced at least one form of violence in the three months prior to this study and about 45% of ATGW suffered sexual violence during the same period. Experiencing discrimination within healthcare settings (from facilities or providers) was negatively associated with sexual health practices.

Rumination as a Mediator between Childhood Trauma and Adulthood Depression/Anxiety in Non-clinical Participants,"Kim, JS; Jin, MJ; Jung, W; Hahn, SW; Lee, SH","Objective: Although there is strong evidence that childhood trauma is associated with the development of depression and anxiety, relatively few studies have explored potential mediating factors for this relationship. The present study aimed to evaluate the mediating role of rumination in the link between childhood trauma and mood status such as depression, anxiety and affective lability.Materials and Methods: Two hundred and seven non-clinical participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Ruminative Response Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the Affective Lability Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the results.Results: Our results supported that rumination is a meaningful mediator between childhood trauma and depression/anxiety in non-clinical participants. The mediation model indicated that childhood trauma and its subtypes are linked to depression and anxiety through three subtypes of rumination, thereby supporting a significant indirect relationship (Standardized coefficient [SC] = 0.56, p < 0.001 for the path from trauma to rumination; SC = 0.67, p < 0.001, from rumination to mood). The direct relationship between childhood trauma and mood symptoms was also significant in a model including rumination (SC = 0.68, p < 0.001). The mediation effect of rumination in the relationship between childhood trauma and mood was more predominant in female participants.Conclusions: The present study found that rumination mediates the influence of childhood trauma on the development of mood symptoms in non clinical participants.

Socio-Cultural Contexts for Normative Gender Violence: Pathways of Risk for Intimate Partner Violence,"Delaney, AX","Violent means of social control at both the micro- and macro-levels create norms of violence within societies that spill over into multiple domains as a reaction to a socio-cultural context of normative violence. This adverse effect may stem from normalized violence within both families and communities and contribute to intimate partner violence (IPV). From a contextual-ecological model, this becomes a victimizing effect. This study tests the theoretical premise of Norms of Violence in order to reconceptualize IPV as a victimizing effect within a larger community framework. Using data from the International Dating Violence Study, this study explores the interaction of violent socialization at both the familial and communal level, controlling for other conditions that could contribute to a normative standard of violence. The results indicate the presence of polyvictimization: nations in which youth experience the highest levels of violent socialization from both their families and communities tend to have higher levels of IPV victimization. This relationship is stronger when social structures support normative violence as conflict resolution. For females, this relationship is further exasperated. Societies across the world, including those in which the context of violence is most prominent, can work towards eradicating the negative impacts of gender violence for individuals, their families, and the communities in which they live by addressing the normalization of violence.",2023,,SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL,12,7,,WOS:001071416000001,10.3390/socsci12070378,,#555,Delaney 2023,"",""
Inevitable or Preventable? The Biosocial Theory of Wartime Rape,"Vance, GS; Zeigler-Hill, V; Vonk, J; Shackelford, TK","Sexual violence has likely been a feature of warfare throughout human history and may even have been present during prehistoric conflicts. In recent decades, international policymakers have improved efforts to prohibit and prosecute wartime sexual violence, including holding criminal tribunals for suspected perpetrators of wartime rape. Social scientists have offered a range of potential explanations for wartime rape and have attempted to bring the data on wartime rape under a single, unified theory. Many such theories have identified sociocultural factors such as patriarchal values, hostile attitudes toward women, or hatred toward specific ethnic groups as potential causes of wartime rape. We review the competing sociocultural theories of wartime rape citing evidence from evolutionary psychology, biology, and anthropology. We highlight strengths of the biosocial theory, which consider the influence of both social and biological factors on wartime rape, and enjoy strong theory-data fit. Specifically, we emphasize the ability of the biosocial theory to not only explain the existence of wartime rape as a near-universal phenomenon, but also its ability to explain variation in rates of wartime rape across armed conflicts.",2024,,EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,,,,WOS:001177454200001,10.1007/s40806-024-00387-2,,#557,Vance 2024,"",""
"Trauma exposure across the lifespan among individuals engaged in treatment with medication for opioid use disorder: differences by gender, PTSD status, and chronic pain","Rodríguez, MN; Colgan, DD; Leyde, S; Pike, K; Merrill, JO; Price, CJ","Background There is little study of lifetime trauma exposure among individuals engaged in medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). A multisite study provided the opportunity to examine the prevalence of lifetime trauma and differences by gender, PTSD status, and chronic pain.Methods A cross-sectional study examined baseline data from participants (N = 303) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a mind-body intervention as an adjunct to MOUD. All participants were stabilized on MOUD. Measures included the Trauma Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5). Analyses involved descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, and linear and logistic regression.Results Participants were self-identified as women (n = 157), men (n = 144), and non-binary (n = 2). Fifty-seven percent (n = 172) self-reported chronic pain, and 41% (n = 124) scored above the screening cut-off for PTSD. Women reported significantly more intimate partner violence (85%) vs 73%) and adult sexual assault (57% vs 13%), while men reported more physical assault (81% vs 61%) and witnessing trauma (66% vs 48%). Men and women experienced substantial childhood physical abuse, witnessed intimate partner violence as children, and reported an equivalent exposure to accidents as adults. The number of traumatic events predicted PTSD symptom severity and PTSD diagnostic status. Participants with chronic pain, compared to those without chronic pain, had significantly more traumatic events in childhood (85% vs 75%).Conclusion The study found a high prevalence of lifetime trauma among people in MOUD.

The impact of stress is central to the vulnerability-stress model, and we review evidence on gender differences in stress exposure, emphasizing gender differences in sex-related traumas such as child sexual abuse and rape. Finally, we examine sociocultural factors that may contribute to the gender difference, including the media and gender inequality.

Resulting conversations revealed variations in the types, frequencies, and patterns of participants' discussions. Mothers with more flexible gender attitudes and higher feminist endorsements were more likely to explicitly refute gender stereotypes in conversations with their children. Children with more flexible gender attitudes were more likely to have mothers who personalized content during the dyadic conversation. When mothers questioned stereotypes through elaboration and personal connections, children were more likely to refute stereotypes in subsequent intervals within the conversation. State space grids mapped parent-child conversational patterns and showed an association between more varied dyadic conversational patterns and children's less stereotyped attitudes.

"Gender inequalities in the workplace: the effects of organizational structures, processes, practices, and decision makers' sexism","Stamarski, CS; Hing, LSS","Gender inequality in organizations is a complex phenomenon that can be seen in organizational structures, processes, and practices. For women, some of the most harmful gender inequalities are enacted within human resources (HRs) practices. This is because HR practices (i.e., policies, decision-making, and their enactment) affect the hiring, training, pay, and promotion of women. We propose a model of gender discrimination in HR that emphasizes the reciprocal nature of gender inequalities within organizations. We suggest that gender discrimination in HR-related decision-making and in the enactment of HR practices stems from gender inequalities in broader organizational structures, processes, and practices. This includes leadership, structure, strategy, culture, organizational climate, as well as HR policies. In addition, organizational decision makers' levels of sexism can affect their likelihood of making gender biased HR-related decisions and/or behaving in a sexist manner while enacting HR practices. Importantly, institutional discrimination in organizational structures, processes, and practices play a pre-eminent role because not only do they affect HR practices, they also provide a socializing context for organizational decision makers' levels of hostile and benevolent sexism.

Does personality affect premating isolation between locally-adapted populations?,"Sommer-Trembo, C; Bierbach, D; Arias-Rodriguez, L; Verel, Y; Jourdan, J; Zimmer, C; Riesch, R; Streit, B; Plath, M","Background: One aspect of premating isolation between diverging, locally-adapted population pairs is female mate choice for resident over alien male phenotypes. Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation, and whether or not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs, and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system.Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of 'novel object exploration', 'boldness' and 'activity in an unknown area' to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females' strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/ or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared when the size difference between the stimulus males was small.Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating decisions, respectively.",2016,,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,16,,,WOS:000378675100002,10.1186/s12862-016-0712-2,,#563,Sommer-Trembo 2016,"",""
Contest competition for fruit and space among wild chimpanzees in relation to the vertical stratification of metabolizable energy,"Houle, A; Wrangham, RW","Variance in the quality of food sites exploited by group-living animals should allow dominant individuals to gain feeding advantages. In some cases of eating in large patches, however, the amount of agonism can be puzzlingly low. We studied this problem in wild adult chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eating ripe fruits in large tree crowns, a context in which little aggression has previously been recorded. Observations were conducted from within the same tree crown as feeding chimpanzees, which allowed us to obtain high-quality data on food distribution, feeding behaviour and aggression. We assessed energy availability and chimpanzee behaviour in relation to their feeding depth. Deeper food sites were associated with less metabolizable food energy (kcal/m3) and lower energy intake rates (kcal/min). Energy availability also varied by tree type (higher in drupe trees than in fig trees) and fruit ripeness (higher in riper fruits). Males were dominant to females, and within both sexes aggressive interactions conformed to a linear hierarchy. Overall higher-ranking individuals used aggression and dominance to access superior feeding sites and achieve higher rates of energy intake, but the effects of dominance varied according to tree type, sex and party composition.

Information and communications technology use to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence in low- and middle-income countries: An evidence and gap map,"Philbrick, W; Milnor, J; Deshmukh, M; Mechael, P","Background The use of information and communications technologies (ICT) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) has increased significantly in the last several years, particularly in health, including related areas such as preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against women and children. While the evidence for ICT effectiveness has grown significantly in the past 5 years in other aspects of health, it has not for effectiveness of using ICT for the prevention and response to SGBV against women and children in LMIC. Objectives The primary goal of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to establish a baseline for the state of the evidence connected with the use of ICT for preventing and responding to SGBV against women and children in LMIC. Objectives that contribute to the achievement of this goal are: identifying evidence of effectiveness for the use of ICT targeting the prevention of, and response to, SGBV against women and children in LMIC; identifying key gaps in the available ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response evidence; identifying research methodology issues reflected in the current evidence; identifying any clusters of evidence in one or more ICT interventions suitable for systematic review; identifying enabling factors associated with effective interventions using ICT for the prevention of, and response to, SGBV against women and children in LMIC; and providing a structured and accessible guide to stakeholders for future investment into interventions and research using ICT for SGBV prevention and response in LMIC. (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) Search Methods The date of the last search from which records were evaluated, and any studies identified were incorporated into the EGM was July 11, 2021. Twenty (20) databases were searched, and identified under ""Methods."" Selection Criteria We conducted systematic searches of multiple academic databases using search terms and criteria related to the use of ICT for prevention and/or response to SGBV against women and children. Although excluded, we did consider studies conducted in higher-income countries (HIC) only to provide context and contrast for the EGM discussion of the eligible studies from LMIC. Data Collection and Analysis The EGM search process included five phases: (1) initial search of academic databases conducted by two researchers simultaneously; (2) comparison of search results, and abstract screening by two researchers collaboratively; (3) second screening by reviewing full articles of the studies identified in the first screening by two reviewers independently; (4) comparison of results of second screening; resolution of discrepancies of screening results; and (5) data extraction and analysis. Main Results The EGM includes 10 studies published in English of which 4 were systematic, literature or scoping reviews directly addressing some aspect of the use of ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response in women and girls. The six individual studies were, or are being, conducted in LMIC (a condition for eligibility). No eligible studies addressed children as a target group, although a number of the ineligible studies reported on the use of ICT for intermediate outcomes connected with violence against children (e.g., digital parenting). Yet, such studies did not explicitly attach those intermediate outcomes to SGBV prevention or response outcomes. Countries represented among the eligible individual studies include Cambodia, Kenya, Nepal Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Lebanon.Of the 10 eligible studies (individual and reviews), most focused on intimate partner violence against women (IPV). Intervention areas among the eligible studies include safety planning using decision algorithms, educational and empowerment messaging regarding norms and attitudes towards gender-based violence (GBV), multi-media radio drama for social behavior change, the collection of survivor experience to inform SGBV/GBV services, and the collection of forensic evidence connected to the perpetration of SGBV. Thirty-one studies which otherwise would have been eligible for the evidence and gap map (EGM) were conducted in HIC (identified under ""Excluded Reviews""). None of the eligible studies reported results related to effectiveness of using ICT in a control setting, for the primary prevention of SGBV as an outcome, but rather reported on outcomes such as usability, secondary and tertiary prevention, feasibility, access to services and other outcomes primarily relating to the development of the interventions. Two studies identified IPV prevention as a measurable outcome within their protocols, but one of these had not yet formally published results regarding primary prevention as an outcome. The other study, while reporting on the protocol (and steps to adapt the ICT application, previously reported as effective in HIC contexts to a specific LMIC context), has not yet as of the date of writing this EGM, published outcome results related to the reduction of IPV. Of the four reviews identified as eligible, two are better characterized as either a literature review or case study rather than as traditional systematic reviews reporting on impact outcomes with methodologically rigorous protocols. Authors' Conclusions The evidence baseline for using ICT to prevent and/or respond to SGBV against women and children in LMIC is nascent. Promising areas for future study include: (1) how ICT can contribute changing gender and social norms related to SGBV and primary prevention; (2) mobile phone applications that promote safety and security; (3) mobile technology for the collection and analysis of survivors' experience with SGBV response services; and (4) digital tools that support the collection of forensic evidence for SGBV response and secondary prevention. Most striking is the paucity of eligible studies examining the use of ICT in connection with preventing or responding to SGBV against children. In light of the exponential increase in the use of ICT by children and adolescents, even in LMIC, greater attention should be given to examining how ICT can be used during adolescence to address gender norms that lead to SGBV. While there appears to be interest in using ICT for SGBV prevention and/or response in LMIC, other than several ad hoc studies, there is little evidence of if, and how effective these interventions are.

Assessment of the Implementation of Policy on Anti-Sexual Harassment in a Nigerian University,"Fasanmi, Success Ayodeji; Seyama, Sadi","Sexual harassment in universities undermines gender equity, safety, and learning. This study assessed the level of implementation of the anti-sexual harassment policy and the influence of implementation of the policy on gender protection of students and staff of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Nigeria. The study was hinged on the feminist theory. The feminist theory considers the plight of any person or people not just women, with a view to destabilizing systems of power and oppression, especially in an academic environment as in this context. The study adopted cross sectional survey research design. The population comprised of 450 students and 200 members of staff (100 teaching and non-teaching staff each) making a total of 650 participants, using a stratified random sampling to ensure proportional representation from the 10 selected faculties. Data was collected using questionnaires and gathered data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results identified gaps in initial awareness and understanding of the anti-sexual harassment policy among students and staff which constituted a setback for the implementation. It was equally noted that the policy development process lacked inclusivity, and implementation activities were perceived as insufficient. Since the implementation process was faulty, the policy has not been able to significantly achieve gender protection on the Campus. The students had uncertain views on the policy's impact, while staff had mixed opinions. The study recommended the need to strengthen policy implementation by way of improving communication channels, transparency, stakeholders' involvement, and monitoring while punitive measures must be enforced when necessary.",2024,,Research in Social Sciences and Technology,9,2,281-301,3123159382; EJ1440809,,,#568,Fasanmi 2024,"",""
Unsettling Tradition: Exploring Intersections of Campus Hazing and White Supremacy,"Allan, Elizabeth J; Gillon, Kathleen E; Beatty, Cameron C; Salinas, Cristobal, Jr; Kerschner, David J","Hazing--a form of interpersonal and community violence often minimized and normalized as tradition--can negatively impact students, undercut university missions, and contribute to harmful campus environments.

In this work, we report the creation process, production, and reception of the short 360° video entitled 'Women in Science.' This movie maps and portrays female researchers' situation in physics at the University of Sao Paulo, a representative subset of the Brazilian physics community. The 360° movies are a novel way of storytelling, attracting public attention, and increasing the empathy caused by immersive experiences. The plots were based on interviews and surveys that embodied the female researcher's experiences over distinct career phases and levels. Challenges concerning the work environment, peer relationships, and the balance between work and personal life have been covered in the movie. All of them emerged in the descriptive analysis as effects that can influence women's career paths and affect their production capacity. This paper summarizes and discusses the scenes and the creative choices over the whole film production. It also reports the movie exhibition and dissemination processes by online streaming video platforms and public sessions with Virtual Reality (VR) gadgets. Based on the attendees' spontaneous response, it is possible to conclude that the movie brought contributions and promoted discussions on gender-related issues in the academic environment.

Yet, 2-year institutions have few resources dedicated to the prevention of and response to sexual violence. Advances in technology, including mobile apps, have provided additional avenues to easily disseminate prevention and response information to college students.

"Reaction Is Not Enough: Decreasing Gendered Harassment in Academic Contexts in Chile, Hong Kong, and the United States","Jackson, Liz; Muñoz-García, Ana Luisa","In diverse academic spaces around the world, sexual and gendered harassment is increasingly recognized as a problem. High-profile cases continue to emerge that underscore how gendered harassment is normalized in elite research contexts. In this article, Liz Jackson and Ana Luisa Muñoz-García analyze three recent policy cases for decreasing sexual and gendered harassment. These cases involve three levels of analysis and three cultural contexts. The first is that of the higher education community in Chile; the second is the University of Hong Kong; and the third is the Philosophy of Education Society, an international academic society based in North America. In each case we analyze how sexual and gendered harassment has been (1) conceptualized, (2) responded to, and (3) contextualized. Through their analysis of these cases, Jackson and Muñoz-García invite readers to reflect on practical and philosophical recommendations for moving forward antiharassment policies and programs, seen broadly.",2019,,Educational Theory,69,1,17-33,2461148392; EJ1228704,https://doi.org/10.1111/edth.12357,,#592,Jackson 2019,"",""
"The Smiling Philosopher: Emotional Labor, Gender, and Harassment in Conference Spaces","Jackson, Liz","Conference environments enable diverse roles for academics. However, conferences are hardly entered into by participants as equals. Academics enter into and experience professional environments differently according to culture, gender, race, ethnicity, class, and more. This paper considers from a philosophical perspective entering and initiating culturally into academic conferences as a woman. It discusses theories of gender and emotional labor and emotional management, focusing on Arlie Hochschild's foundational work, and affect in gendered social relations, considering Sara Ahmed's theorization of the feminist killjoy and the affect alien. It applies these lenses to explore problematic experiences of women initiates at conferences. The paper proceeds with a theoretical discussion of gender, emotional labor, and affect. Then the paper discusses women academics' experiences generally and at conferences, including educational research conferences, with reference to relevant higher education research as well as anecdotal evidence, relating these experiences to the theories.

The Extent and Nature of Bullying in a Christian School,"Hazeltine, Brian C.; Hernandez, David A.","Bullying is a problem that has been studied in schools worldwide, but there is little research on bullying within Christian schools, a dearth which may stem from the assumption that Christian schools teach character traits that are inimical to bullying.

Guided by social identity theory, which allowed for a focus on moral and character development, this study examined the extent and nature of bullying among 347 students in Grades 3 through 10 in a Christian school. Research questions addressed differences in bullying behaviors related to gender, grade, division, and the number of years a student has attended a Christian school. Data were analyzed from responses to the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire. One-way analysis of variance, chi-square, and ""t"" tests indicated statistically significant differences in bullying behaviors based on gender, division, and years attending the school. Results indicated that girls were bullied more frequently than boys and by means of exclusion, rumors, sexual comments, and cyberbullying. Boys were more likely to bully than girls, and boys bullied primarily in physical ways and used racial comments more often than did girls. Bullying decreased from elementary to high school grades.

Are outness and community involvement risk or protective factors for alcohol and drug abuse among sexual minority women?,"Feinstein, Brian A.; Dyar, Christina; London, Bonita","Sexual minority women (SMW) are at increased risk for substance abuse compared to heterosexual women. Two psychosocial factors that have been implicated in SMW’s substance abuse are outness and LGBT community involvement, but findings have been mixed as to whether these are risk or protective factors. One possible explanation is that they may have different consequences for subgroups of SMW (lesbians, bisexual women, and queer women). While being open about one’s sexual orientation and involved in the community may be protective for lesbians, discrimination against bisexual women may lead these same factors to contribute to substance abuse for bisexual women. It is unclear how these associations will operate for queer women, given limited research on this subpopulation. The current study examined whether sexual identity moderated the associations between outness and community involvement with alcohol and drug abuse. We also examined whether perceived discrimination would help explain why these associations may be different for subgroups of SMW. A sample of 288 self-identified SMW (113 lesbians, 106 bisexual women, and 69 queer women) completed an online survey. Higher outness was associated with higher alcohol and drug abuse for bisexual women, but not for lesbians or queer women. Similarly, higher community involvement was associated with higher drug abuse for bisexual women, but not for lesbians or queer women. Among bisexual women, the association between community involvement and drug abuse was mediated by perceived discrimination. Further, the association between outness and drug abuse was mediated by both community involvement and perceived discrimination. Findings demonstrate that outness and community involvement function as risk factors for substance abuse for bisexual women, in part due to their associations with discrimination.

Lind, Eric J. Gutierrez, Dorothy J. Yamamoto, Michael F. Regner, Sherry A. McKee and Jody Tanabe (Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 2017[Apr][1], Vol 173, 92-98). In the originally published article, figures appeared in the incorrect order. Corrected figures are presented in erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2017-14661-013[/rid]). Background: Sex differences in brain structure and clinical course of substance use disorders underscores the need to include women in structural brain imaging studies. The NIH has supported the need for research to address sex differences. We evaluated female enrollment in substance abuse structural brain imaging research and the methods used to study sex differences in substance effects. Methods: Structural brain imaging studies published through 2016 (n=230) were evaluated for number of participants by sex and substance use status and methods used to evaluate sex differences. Temporal trends in the numbers of participants by sex and substance use status were analyzed. We evaluated how often sex effects were appropriately analyzed and the proportion of studies that found sex by substance interactions on volumetric measures. Results: Female enrollment increased over time, but remained significantly lower than male enrollment (p =0.01), with the greatest bias for alcohol and opiate studies. 79% of studies included both sexes; however, 74% did not evaluate sex effects or used an analytic approach that precluded detection of sex by substance use interactions. 85% of studies that stratified by sex reported different substance effects on brain volumes. Only 33% of studies examining two-way interactions found significant interactions, highlighting that many studies were underpowered to detect interactions. Conclusions: Although female participation in substance use studies of brain morphometry has increased, sex disparity persists. Studying adequate numbers of both sexes and employing correct analytic approaches is critical for understanding sex differences in brain morphometric changes in substance abuse.

Differences by sexual minority status in relationship abuse and sexual and reproductive health among adolescent females,"McCauley, Heather L.; Dick, Rebecca N.; Tancredi, Daniel J.; Goldstein, Sandi; Blackburn, Samantha; Silverman, Jay G.; Monasterio, Erica; James, Lisa; Miller, Elizabeth","Purpose: Little is known about adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) and related sexual and reproductive health among females who either identify as lesbian or bisexual or engage in sexual behavior with female partners (i.e., sexual minority girls [SMGs]). Methods: Baseline data were collected from 564 sexually active girls ages 14–19 years seeking care at eight California school-based health centers participating in a randomized controlled trial. Associations between ARA, sexual minority status and study outcomes (vaginal, oral, and anal sex, number and age of sex partners, contraceptive nonuse, reproductive coercion, sexually transmitted infection [STI] and pregnancy testing) were assessed via logistic regression models for clustered survey data. Results: SMGs comprised 23% (n = 130) of the sample. Controlling for exposure to ARA, SMGs were less likely to report recent vaginal sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], .51; 95% confidence interval [CI], .35–.75) and more likely to report recent oral sex (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.38–2.92) and anal sex (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26–2.46) compared with heterosexual girls. Heterosexual girls with ARA exposure (AOR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.07–7.59) and SMGs without ARA exposure (AOR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.01–4.50) were more likely than nonabused heterosexual girls be seeking care for STI testing or treatment than heterosexual girls without recent victimization.

Does the factor structure of military sexual stressors in men correspond to women’s? A confirmatory factor analysis using the Sexual Harassment Inventory,"Reddy, Madhavi K.; Murdoch, Maureen","Objectives: Unwanted sexual stressors experienced by military men and women are associated with a host of negative physical and mental health problems. Government officials are making it a priority to put a stop to these unwanted sexual experiences. However, the measure typically used measures sexual stressors much better for women than for men. The purpose of the present study was to test the factor structure of an alternative measure, the Sexual Harassment Inventory (SHI), to examine whether sexual stressors experienced by men correspond to women’s experiences. Methods: We used three preexisting datasets in which the SHI was used to assess active and former military members’ sexual stressor experiences. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis to identify women’s response patterns and a confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether men’s response patterns corresponded to women’s. Results: Findings showed that the SHI has evidence of factorial validity in female service members and adequate, but not exceptional, factorial fit for male service members.

"Explaining mental health disparities for non-monosexual women: Abuse history and risky sex, or the burdens of non-disclosure?","Persson, Tonje J.; Pfaus, James G.; Ryder, Andrew G.","Research has found that non-monosexual women report worse mental health than their heterosexual and lesbian counterparts. The reasons for these mental health discrepancies are unclear. This study investigated whether higher levels of child abuse and risky sexual behavior, and lower levels of sexual orientation disclosure, may help explain elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety among non-monosexual women. Participants included 388 women living in Canada (Mean age = 24.40, SD = 6.40, 188 heterosexual, 53 mostly heterosexual, 64 bisexual, 32 mostly lesbian, 51 lesbian) who filled out the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories as part of an online study running from April 2011 to February 2014. Participants were collapsed into non-monosexual versus monosexual categories. Non-monosexual women reported more child abuse, risky sexual behavior, less sexual orientation disclosure, and more symptoms of depression and anxiety than monosexual women. Statistical mediation analyses, using conditional process modeling, revealed that sexual orientation disclosure and risky sexual behavior uniquely, but not sequentially, mediated the relation between sexual orientation, depression and anxiety. Sexual orientation disclosure and risky sexual behavior were both associated with depression and anxiety. Childhood abuse did not moderate depression, anxiety, or risky sexual behavior. Findings indicate that elevated levels of risky sexual behavior and deflated levels of sexual orientation disclosure may in part explain mental health disparities among non-monosexual women. Results highlight potential targets for preventive interventions aimed at decreasing negative mental health outcomes for non-monosexual women, such as public health campaigns targeting bisexual stigma and the development of sex education programs for vulnerable sexual minority women, such as those defining themselves as bisexual, mostly heterosexual, or mostly lesbian.

Exploring mechanisms of racial disparities in intimate partner violence among sexual and gender minorities assigned female at birth,"Whitton, Sarah W.; Lawlace, Margaret; Dyar, Christina; Newcomb, Michael E.","Objective: Sexual and gender minority people of color (SGM-POC) report higher rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) than White SGM, adding to growing evidence that people holding multiple stigmatized social identities are at particular risk for adverse experiences. We aimed to identify mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in IPV among SGM, focusing on childhood experiences of violence, structural inequalities, and sexual minority stress. Method: 308 SGM assigned female-at-birth (AFAB; 82 White, 133 Black, 93 Latinx; age 16–31) self-reported on minor psychological, severe psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and three proposed mechanisms: childhood violence (child abuse, witnessing interparental violence), structural inequalities (economic stress, racial discrimination), and sexual minority stressors (internalized heterosexism, anti-SGM victimization, low social support). Indirect effects of race on IPV victimization via hypothesized mechanisms were estimated using logistic regression with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. Results: Compared to White participants, Black participants were 2.5–7.03 times more likely to report all eight IPV types; Latinx participants were 2.5–4.8 times more likely to experience four IPV types. Univariate indirect effects analyses indicated that these racial/ethnic disparities were partially explained by higher economic stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and childhood violence experiences (for Black and Latinx participants) and lower social support (Black participants). In multivariate models, the most robust indirect effects were through racial/ethnic discrimination and childhood violence. Conclusions: Findings underscore the need for policy and interventions aimed at preventing IPV among SGM-POC by targeting factors that contribute to IPV disparities in this group, particularly racial/ethnic discrimination and family violence.

Nearly half of those claims represented sex‐based harassment. The #MeToo movement has shined a spotlight on the pervasiveness of harassment across sectors and institutions. A 2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine indicates that 58 percent of women in academic institutions, for instance, have experienced some form of sexual harassment. In this article, the authors propose a three‐part framework to establish a culture of zero tolerance of sexual harassment. The framework helps academic and other institutions prevent sexual harassment, protect victims from risks of reporting harassment, and set accountability measures to demand justice. The utility of the framework is twofold. First, administrators can apply it as a tool to audit institutional attitudes toward sexual harassment. Second, leaders can apply it as a corrective tool to prevent permissive organizational climates that allow sexual harassment to be perpetuated.

Fear of sexual victimization in metaverse: A comparison of adolescent and adult female users,"Park, Soyoung; Kim, Jiwon","Metaverse platforms have gained worldwide popularity in recent years. This increase in popularity has also heightened safety concerns, as virtual sexual assault against children and the youth is on the rise. The issue of sexual abuse in the metaverse is becoming increasingly controversial due to the gaps in the current regulatory framework that result from the uncertain consequences of such virtual crimes. Drawing on an online survey of female users of Zepeto (n = 343), a metaverse social network platform where users interact with others while creating personalized avatars and virtual spaces, this study aims to explore how female users interpret the risk of sexual harassment in Zepeto, examining the triggers of emotional distress and behavioral change that result from such risk assessments by users. It investigates how these interpretations and responses vary depending on their sense of presence and engagement in the virtual environment and identification with their avatars and how all these processes differ between adolescent and adult female users.

Data were from a nationally representative survey investigating sexual violence among adults living in Ireland (n = 3120). Descriptive statistics and regression analysis investigated the characteristics of female versus male perpetrated sexual abuse. Approximately 6% of all the victims of child sexual abuse in the sample were abused by a lone female, which represents 1.5% of the overall adult population. Analyses indicated that male and female perpetrated abuse differ mainly in terms of the demographic characteristics of the perpetrators and victims: female perpetrators are more likely to be younger, and are more likely to abuse male victims and older children and adolescents (9–17 years), compared with male perpetrators. In addition, female perpetrators are less likely to be a stranger to the victim and in a position of authority, compared with male perpetrators. Treatment services should be particularly tailored for female perpetrated abuse, as the dynamics between the victim and perpetrator are likely to be different to male perpetrated abuse.

Gender moderates the influence of psychosocial factors and drug use on HARRT adherence in the context of HIV and childhood sexual abuse,"Wilson, Sarah M.; Sikkema, Kathleen J.; Ranby, Krista W.","This study aimed to examine gender moderation within a stress and coping model of HIV medication adherence in adults with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Sequelae of CSA, including negative coping, psychological distress, and drug use, interfere with adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). These obstacles to adherence are likely moderated by gender. Gender may particularly influence the mediational effect of drug use on adherence. Participants included 206 adults living with HIV/AIDS and CSA. Categorical/continuous variable methodology in a structural equation modeling framework was used to test a multigroup model with women and men. Gender significantly moderated several effects in the model. For women, the effect of psychological distress on HAART adherence was mediated by drug use and the effect of drug use on viral load was mediated by HAART adherence. Among men, drug use did not significantly impact adherence. Since gender appears to moderate the effect of drug use on medication adherence, it is particularly important to address drug use within the context of HIV disease management in women with a history of CSA. Further, interventions to increase HAART adherence should take trauma history, gender, and drug abuse into account when assessing efficacy.

"Inferring sexual interest in different types of relationships: Effects of gender, alcohol, and attitudes","Terrett, Isabelle M.; Anderson, Ryan C.","Although many researchers have documented men’s tendency to interpret individual’s behaviours more sexually than do women, few have considered how perceived sexual interest differs depending on the male–female relationship. This study addresses this gap in a diverse sample of six-hundred participants who viewed one of six vignettes depicting a short interaction between a male and a female actor (targets) where relationship type and alcohol presence were experimentally manipulated. Unexpectedly female participants perceived more sexual interest (from observations of both male and female targets) than males did. Participants rated more sexual interest in the actors who were in the casual dating and long-term dating conditions, compared to the friendly condition. Male and female actors were generally perceived to be equally sexually interested, but when gender role and rape myth attitudes were controlled for, the female actor was perceived to be more sexually interested than the male actor (by both male and female participants). Surprisingly, participants did not perceive more sexual interest when alcohol was present in the interaction compared to when it was not. These findings suggest that while contextual factors can affect perceptions of sexual interest, gender role and rape myth attitudes should also be considered.

Data analysis was inspired by a qualitative approach of thematic analysis. Emergent themes from the interviews were identified and coded using NVivo software, while SPSS software was useful to generate descriptive statistics in order to characterise the data set based on its properties. Key findings include the dearth of reporting cases of sextortion and its laws; persistence of patriarchal system; gender income inequality and an increase in the unemployment rate as the main causes of sextortion. The decline of victims’ economic status; psychological and health problems; an increase of gender inequality and domestic violence; a decrease of productivity and credibility; and deterioration of various human rights were among the main consequences of this phenomenon.

"Negative and interactive effects of sex, aging, and alcohol abuse on gray matter morphometry","Thayer, Rachel E.; Hagerty, Sarah L.; Sabbineni, Amithrupa; Claus, Eric D.; Hutchison, Kent E.; Weiland, Barbara J.","Chronic alcohol use is associated with declines in gray matter (GM) volume, as is the normal aging process. Less apparent, however, is how the interaction between aging and heavy alcohol use affects changes in GM across the lifespan. There is some evidence that women are more vulnerable to the negative effects of alcohol use on GM than men. In the current study, we examined whether localized GM was related to measures of alcohol use disorder (e.g., AUDIT score) in a large sample (N = 436) of participants, ages 18–55 years, with a range of disease severity, using both voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) and surface‐based morphometry (SBM). We also explored whether GM associations with alcohol use disorder (AUD) severity are moderated by sex and age. Results showed significant negative associations between AUD severity and GM volume throughout temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes. Women showed more negative effects of alcohol use than men for cortical thickness in left orbitofrontal cortex, but evidence for increased vulnerability based on sex was limited overall. Similarly, a specific age by alcohol use interaction was observed for volume of right insula, but other regional or global interactions were not statistically supported. However, significant negative associations between heavy alcohol use and GM volumes were observed as early as 18–25 years. These findings support that alcohol has deleterious effects on global and regional GM above and beyond age, and, of particular importance, that regional associations emerge in early adulthood.

Neurodevelopmental disorders and subsequent risk of violent victimization: Exploring sex differences and mechanisms,"Ghirardi, Laura; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf; Pettersson, Erik; Sariaslan, Amir; Arseneault, Louise; Fazel, Seena; D'Onofrio, Brian M.; Lichtenstein, Paul; Larsson, Henrik","Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) are associated with experiences of victimization, but mechanisms remain unclear. We explored sex differences and the role of familial factors and externalizing problems in the association between several NDs and violent victimization in adolescence and young adulthood. Methods: Individuals born in Sweden 1985–1997, residing in Sweden at their 15th birthday, were followed until date of violent victimization causing a hospital visit or death, death due to other causes, emigration, or December 31, 2013, whichever came first. The exposures were diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and other NDs. We used three different Cox regression models: a crude model, a model adjusted for familial confounding using sibling-comparisons, and a model additionally adjusted for externalizing problems. Results: Among 1 344 944 individuals followed, on average, for 5 years, 74 487 were diagnosed with NDs and 37 765 had a hospital visit or died due to violence. ADHD was associated with an increased risk of violent victimization in males [hazard ratio (HR) 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.43–2.70) and females (HR 5.39; 95% CI 4.97–5.85). ASD and ID were associated with an increased risk of violent victimization in females only. After adjusting for familial factors and externalizing problems, only ADHD was associated with violent victimization among males (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.06–1.51) and females (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.21–2.36). Conclusions: Females with NDs and males with ADHD are at greater risk of being victim of severe violence during adolescence and young adulthood. Relevant mechanisms include shared familial liability and externalizing problems. ADHD may be independently associated with violent victimization.

Not hardwired: The complex neurobiology of sex differences in violence,"Niehoff, Debra","Behavior is the product of a brain shaped by a dynamic interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This neuroplasticity facilitates adaptation but can also lead to behavioral pathology when individuals with inherent vulnerabilities are exposed to dysfunctional environments, particularly early in life. Differences in the frequency and intensity of violent behavior in men and women may reflect underlying differences in brain structure, function, or connectivity that result from such interactions. This perspective provides a brief overview of research on sex differences in the neural circuitry mediating emotion, stress responses, and a specific gene–environment interaction, all of which may contribute to sex differences in violence.

Political differences in american reports of sexual harassment and assault,"Jose, Rupa; Fowler, James H.; Raj, Anita","Political ideology has been linked to beliefs regarding sexual harassment and assault (SH&A). Using data from the January 2018 Stop Street Sexual Harassment online poll (N = 2,009), this study examined associations of political identity and political ideology with self-reported experiences of being the victim of SH&A. SH&A experiences were coded into four mutually exclusive groups: none, non-physically aggressive harassment, physically aggressive harassment, or sexual assault. Sex-stratified logistic regression models assessed associations of interest, adjusting for participant demographics. Among women, more conservative political ideology was negatively associated with reports of sexual assault, odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.74, 0.98]. Among males, more conservative political ideology was negatively associated with reports of physically aggressive sexual harassment (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = [0.73, 0.98]), and greater Republican affiliation was negatively associated with reports of sexual assault (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.99]). Conservative and Republican women and men are thus less likely to report more severe forms of SH&A, which may explain differences in beliefs on these issues.

Profiles of intimate partner violence and their differential association with gender hostility among men seeking help,"Patterson-Beaumont, Kayla; Daspe, Marie-Ève; Péloquin, Katherine; Godbout, Natacha; Lafontaine, Marie-France; Savard, Claudia; Brassard, Audrey","Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrated by men has been associated with men’s hostility toward women (HTW). However, no study that has examined HTW has considered every main form of IPV as well as the severity of the acts perpetrated. The purpose of the present study was to identify distinct profiles of IPV perpetration based on the severity of physical, psychological, and sexual IPV and coercive control acts and to examine potential differences in HTW between the resulting profiles in a sample of 969 men seeking help for anger management or domestic violence. In addition, given the association previously found between HTW and IPV perpetration in women, we also investigated whether hostility toward men (HTM) could also be linked to men’s profiles of IPV perpetration. The results of the latent profile analysis suggested four profiles of IPV perpetrators: minor psychological IPV and severe control, severe IPV and control, minor IPV and control, and no/minor psychological IPV. Results also indicated significant differences between the profiles in terms of both HTW and HTM. Specifically, greater HTW was observed among the profiles characterized by the highest proportion of physical IPV perpetration, whereas greater HTM was observed among the profiles characterized by the highest proportions of severe coercive IPV. Findings will contribute to guide intervention strategies tailored to these different subgroups of men.

Sex- and dose-dependent abuse liability of repeated subanesthetic ketamine in rats,"Schoepfer, Kristin J.; Strong, Caroline E.; Saland, Samantha K.; Wright, Katherine N.; Kabbaj, Mohamed","Rationale: Subanesthetic ketamine (KET) elicits rapid, robust, but transient antidepressant effects. KET's antidepressant actions can be augmented and maintained for a longer duration when repeatedly delivered. However, KET is recreationally abused, raising long-term treatment safety concerns. Women are more likely than men to seek treatment for depression, escalate from casual to compulsive drug use, and are more sensitive to antidepressants. Similarly, female rodents are more sensitive than males to KET's rapid antidepressant-like behavioral effects; dose-response thresholds in these assays equal 2.5 and 5.0mg/kg (i.p.), respectively. This suggests the utility of preclinical rodent models in optimizing sex-differential KET therapy protocols and minimizing adverse drug reactions. Objectives: Here, we assessed behavioral and biochemical correlates of abuse liability following six serial KET treatments on alternating days at three subanesthetic, antidepressant-like doses (2.5, 5.0, or 10mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male and female rats. A potential role for ΔFosB-mediated transcription in the nucleus accumbens is outlined in the context of KET-mediated locomotor sensitization. Results: Antidepressant-like threshold doses (2.5, 5.0mg/kg KET) failed to evoke a conditioned place preference in all animals, but only males positively responded to a higher dose (10mg/kg). Behavioral sensitization to 5.0 or 10mg/kg KET's locomotor-activating effects was established in both sexes, and females' sensitized response to 5.0mg/kg was greater than males'. KET-induced hyperlocomotion positively correlated with ΔFosB protein expression in the nucleus accumbens. rAAV-ΔJunD inhibition of ΔFosB-mediated transcription in the accumbens failed to block locomotor sensitization to 10mg/kg KET. Conclusions: These data suggest that in rats, six alternating-day treatments with 2.5mg/kg KET do not induce apparent behavioral signatures of abuse liability despite accumulation of ΔFosB protein in the accumbens. Additionally, females are more sensitive than males to KET's locomotor-stimulant properties, both acutely and after repeated treatments. More studies are needed to determine brain regions and neural mechanisms responsible for KET-induced behavioral adaptations and to extrapolate these data to inform sex-dependent strategies for long-term KET therapy protocols for depression.

For ICSS studies, electrodes were implanted in the medial forebrain bundle and rats trained to press for electrical stimulation over a range of frequencies (56–158 Hz, 0.05 log increments) under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule, and the potency (0.32–3.2 mg/kg, 10min pretreatment) and time course (3.2. mg/kg, 10–180 min pretreatment) of MDMA effects were determined. For in vivo microdialysis, rats were implanted with bilateral guide cannulae targeting the NAc, and the time course of MDMA effects (1.0–3.2 mg/kg, 0–180 min) on DA and 5HT was determined. MDMA produced qualitatively similar effects in both sexes on ICSS (both increases in low ICSS rates maintained by low brain-stimulation frequencies and decreases in high ICSS rates maintained by high brain-stimulation frequencies) and microdialysis (increases in both DA and 5HT). The duration and peak levels of both abuse-related ICSS facilitation and increases in NAc DA were longer in females. MDMA was also more potent to increase 5HT in females.

Sex differences in poly-victimization among youth experiencing homelessness prior to substance use treatment,"DiGuiseppi, Graham T.; Ring, Colin R.; Rice, Eric R.; Davis, Jordan P.","Background: Poly-victimization is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and youth in substance use treatment. To date, studies have not examined poly-victimization among these two intersecting populations. Objective: To examine heterogeneity in lifetime victimization experiences among youth reporting homelessness at substance use treatment entry; identify demographic predictors of victimization class membership; and associations between victimization and clinical characteristics at treatment intake. Participants and setting: 1270 adolescents and young adults reporting past 90-day homelessness in a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Methods: Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and logistic regression were used to examine heterogeneity in poly-victimization experiences, and associations with demographics and clinical characteristics for males and females. Results: Four victimization classes emerged for males, and five victimization classes emerged for females. The prevalence of victimization and trauma characteristics were higher for females, except physical victimization, which was higher for males. Age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status were related to poly-victimization class membership, but not consistently across classes. Compared to low or single victimization classes, youth in the poly-victimization class had higher odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and exchange sex (among females); Poly-victimization class membership was not associated with duration of recent homelessness or substance use disorder diagnoses, when compared to low/less complex victimization. Conclusion: High rates of lifetime victimization were found for YEH in substance use treatment, with rates generally higher among females.

Sex differences in substance abuse treatment adherence in the United States,"Bornstein, Kristin; Longinaker, Nyaradzo; Bryant-Genevier, Marthe; Terplan, Mishka","Background and Aims: There are sex differences regarding the frequency and patterns, barriers to care, and consequences of drug abuse. However, it is unclear if and how these factors influence substance abuse treatment (SAT) adherence. This study investigates whether sex is an independent predictor of SAT adherence controlling for treatment modality using national-level data. Design: Analysis used secondary cohort data comparing adherent and nonadherent SAT discharges by sex. Further comparisons examined the influence of SAT modality (ambulatory, rehabilitation, or detoxification) controlling for demographic characteristics using logistic regression. Setting: Data were obtained from the Treatment Episodes Data Set—Discharges, 2006 to 2008, a publicly available deidentified administrative data set that tracks admissions into all SAT facilities that receive federal funding. Participants: To maintain independence, this study was limited to first-time Treatment Episodes Data Set—Discharges episodes. Measurements: The primary outcome was defined dichotomously as adherence to SAT (completed or transferred to another program) and nonadherence (all other reasons for discharge). Findings: From 2006 to 2008 there were 1,779,248 primary SAT episodes (66% male). A total of 61% of these ended in adherence with minimal differences observed between sexes in adjusted analyses (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.01).

The present study investigated sex differences in the relationship between violence exposure and the neural processes that underlie emotion regulation. In the present study, 200 participants completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure in which cued and non-cued threats (i.e., unconditioned stimuli) were presented during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Violence exposure was previously assessed at four separate time points when participants were 11–19 years of age. Significant threat type (cued versus non-cued) × sex and sex × violence exposure interactions were observed. Specifically, women and men differed in amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus reactivity to cued versus non-cued threat.

Methods: Information on gender harassment, sexual harassment and support by colleagues were derived from the biannual Swedish Work Environment Survey 1999-2013, a representative sample of the Swedish working population (N=64 297). Information on LTSA as well as demographic and workplace variables were added from register data. Relative rates of LTSA the year following the exposure were determined using modified Poisson regression. Results: Monthly to daily exposure to gender harassment was a risk factor for prospective LTSA among women [rate ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.05] and men (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10). Monthly to daily exposure to sexual harassment was also a risk factor for LTSA among women (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10) and men (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13). Exposure to sexual or gender harassment once in the last 12 months was not associated with LTSA. There was no support for an interaction between either of the exposures and support from colleagues in relation to LTSA. Conclusions: Sexual harassment and gender harassment appear to contribute to a small excess risk for LTSA among women and men. For both kinds of offensive behaviors, the pervasiveness appears to be important for the outcome. The role of support by colleagues was inconclusive and needs further investigation.

Sexual orientation and gender identity victimization among young adults in the New York City metropolitan area: The P18 cohort study,"LoSchiavo, Caleb; Halkitis, Perry N.; Kapadia, Farzana","Sexual and gender minority populations are significantly more likely to experience verbal and physical victimization in young adulthood. These analyses examine the types, contexts, and sources of lifetime sexual orientation and gender identity victimization (SGV) in a diverse sample of sexual minority men (SMM) and transgender women as well as the extent to which experiences of SGV vary among subgroups of the population. Cross-sectional data were collected as part of a study of sexual health, mental health, and HIV examined through the lens of syndemic production in young SMM. Measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics as well as the types, sources, and contexts of physical assault and verbal harassment due to actual or perceived gender or sexuality. Verbal harassment was more prevalent in the sample than physical assault (44.5% vs. 11.6%). Schools or sports teams and neighborhoods were the most common contexts for verbal and physical SGV. Strangers were the most frequent perpetrators of SGV, followed by family and peers. Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in SGV based on race, education, perceived familial SES, sexual identity, and borough of residence. In multivariate analyses, race, SES, sexual identity, and borough of residence were significant predictors of verbal SGV. Findings suggest that SGV experiences are not uniform in sexual minority young adults, and thus prevention and care must be targeted. Understanding the multiple identities of sexual minority young adults who experience greater levels of victimization can allow for policy and interventions to best support those at risk. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement—The perpetration of physical and verbal victimization on sexual minority young adults creates psychosocial conditions that compromise the well-being of individuals and the entire population. However, experiences of victimization are not uniform across the intersecting identities of sexual minority young adults. This necessitates an understanding of how these experiences vary, creating more burden in some segments of the population and, in turn, informing targeted implementation of prevention and counseling strategies.

Since the last 10 months, it is dominating over the whole world. Till now there is no vaccine or treatment against it. Therefore, every day a huge number of people are being infected and dying due to COVID-19. While it has far-reaching effects on people worldwide, its impacts are particularly pronounced to certain segments, such as girls and women. However, during a humanitarian crisis (e.g., war and conflict, disease outbreaks, pandemic, famine), girls and women are especially considered as vulnerable due to gender inequality. Thus, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women has not stopped or reduced. Everyday so many women and girls are raped and sexually harassed, which are now top news for media and press. Even in the literature, several studies are available on violence against women and girls amid COVID-19 worldwide. Hence, sexual assault against COVID-19- positive patients are not addressed in literature till date. Actually, it is not normal that any mentally fit people can imagine that a COVID-19-positive patients can be raped in the current situation, but surprisingly a few rape incidents on COVID-19-positive patient were reported in India, which are available in press and in social media.

The associations of everyday and major discrimination exposure with violence and poor mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Raj, Anita; Chatterji, Sangeeta; Johns, Nicole E.; Yore, Jennifer; Dey, Arnab K.; Williams, David R.","Research on discrimination and risks for violence and mental health issues under the pandemic is notably absent. We examined the relative effects of perceived everyday discrimination (e.g., poorer service, disrespectful treatment in a typical week) and major experiences of race-based discrimination (e.g., racial/ethnic discrimination in housing or employment at any point in the lifetime) on experiences of violence and the PHQ-4 assessment of symptoms of depression and anxiety under the pandemic. We analyzed state-representative cross-sectional survey data from California adults (<I>N</I> = 2114) collected in March 2021. We conducted multivariate regression models adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, income, and disability. One in four Californians (26.1%) experienced everyday discrimination in public spaces, due most often to race/ethnicity and gender. We found that everyday discrimination was significantly associated with past year physical violence (single form Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 5.0, 95% CI 2.5–10.3; multiple forms AOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–5.8), past year sexual violence (multiple forms AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4–4.4), and mental health symptoms (e.g., severe symptoms, multiple forms AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6–6.7). Major experiences of race-based discrimination (reported by 10.0% of Californians) were associated with past year sexual violence (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.8) and severe mental health symptoms (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2–6.2). Non-race-based major discrimination (reported by 23.9% of Californians) was also associated with violence and mental health outcomes Everyday discrimination, more than major experiences of discrimination, was associated with higher risk for violence and poor mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Non-race-based forms of major discrimination independently were also associated with these negative outcomes.

The consequences of alcohol-involved sexual victimization in male and female college students,"Kehayes, Ivy-Lee L.; Hudson, Amanda; Thompson, Kara; Wekerle, Christine; Stuart, Heather; Dobson, Keith; Krupa, Terry","Alcohol intoxication is often involved for both victims and perpetrators of sexual victimization. Yet, alcohol-involved sexual victimization research has mainly focused on female victims, excluding male victims. The current study addresses gaps in the literature by focusing on sex differences in the emotional harms (anxiety and depression symptomatology) experienced by sexual victimization victims when either the perpetrator or victim was drinking. Five-hundred-and-ten undergraduate drinkers (153 male; 357 female) participated. Models included two dichotomized predictors that occurred during participants’ first year of university (sexually victimized when the victim was drinking, sexually victimized by someone who was drinking), and two emotional outcomes (anxiety, depression). Age was controlled in all path analyses and sex was examined as a moderator. When predictors were examined in separate models, both predictors were associated with increased anxiety but not depression. These effects were significantly stronger among men. When both predictors were entered simultaneously, individuals who were victimized by someone drinking displayed increased anxiety, and this relationship was stronger among men than women victims. Being victimized when drinking was no longer associated with anxiety, consistent with prior findings that post-traumatic distress may be minimized when a trauma occurs while the victim is intoxicated. Results highlight the impact sexual victimization can have for both male and female victims, and point to the need for evidence-based policies to prevent emotional second-hand alcohol harms among male and female students alike.

The doorway effect: Stories of feminist activism and survival in the neoliberal university,"Mackinlay, Elizabeth; Lipton, Briony","A doorway is an entrance into a space. A gateway that denotes passage and movement. In the contemporary university, doors separate, connect, and demarcate belonging and exclusion. In our experiences as academics and in our qualitative interviews with academic women at universities across Australia, there are many accounts of the liminality of doorways and of doors being closed literally and metaphorically. Closed doors speak to a lack of transparency and a blind eye to inequality and discrimination in academia, as well as an absence of connectedness and solidarity in a highly competitive and critical neoliberal work environment. What happens in these academic entrance ways in neoliberal times? Drawing on critical autoethnography and the writings of Virginia Woolf and Helene Cixous, this paper uses the spatial metaphor of doorways as symbolic structures to describe the dissonance between academics and institutions as well as between individuals. In this paper the neurological and cultural phenomenon of 'the doorway effect' is employed as an allegory of forgetting to highlight the way the individualisation of thoughts and feelings diverts attention away from institutional accountability on issues of gender inequalities in Australian higher education.

The effect of prototypical #MeToo features on the perception of social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment,"Kessler, Andrea Melanie; Kennair, Leif Edward Ottesen; Grøntvedt, Trond Viggo; Bjørkheim, Ida; Drejer, Idun; Bendixen, Mons","The #MeToo movement has to a large degree addressed a specific type of sexual harassment, focusing on quid pro quo over hostile environment type sexual harassment. Prototypical #MeToo features include male over female actor; superior over subordinate actor; repeated over single case harassment; private over public settings; personal over general targets and sexualized over non-sexualized physical contact. We predict that these prototypical #MeToo features that gained attention during the campaign will increase peoples’ perception of which social-sexual behaviors are considered to be sexual harassment. Predictions were tested in a sample of 489 Norwegian participants (66% women). The results suggest that men tend to rate female actions as less harassing than male actions, while women did not make such a difference. We also observed a bias toward prototypical types of sexual harassment, as people perceive these more as sexual harassment compared to less prototypical but equally harmful types.

Unsolicited pics and sexual scripts: Gender and relationship context of compliant and non-consensual technology-mediated sexual interactions,"Courtice, Erin Leigh; Czechowski, Konrad; Noorishad, Pari-Gole; Shaughnessy, Krystelle","Technology-mediated sexual interaction (TMSI) refers to any partnered interaction that involves sending or receiving self-created, sexually explicit content using communication technology (e. g., sexting, cybersex). Most research on TMSI assumes that experiences are desired and consensual. However, it is likely that some people do not desire all their TMSI experiences but consent to them anyways (compliance), or experience non-consensual TMSIs. People also engage in TMSIs with different types of partners. According to the traditional sexual script (TSS), other-gender attracted women and men's non-consensual TMSI experiences should differ overall and depending on the relationship context of the experience. The goal of this study was to examine the role of sexual scripts in other-gender attracted women and men's non-consensual and compliant TMSI experiences with committed romantic partners (CRPs), known non-partners (KNPs), and strangers (Ss). Women (n = 331) and men (n = 120) completed an online survey with questions about lifetime prevalence of experiencing seven types of compliant and non-consensual TMSIs in each relationship context. Results of mixed ANOVAs revealed significant interactions: overall, more participants reported compliant TMSI with CRPs. More women than men had received a non-consensual TMSI from someone they were not in a committed relationship with, and more men than women reported sending non-consensual TMSIs to a stranger. Tests of unpaired proportions suggested that the prevalence of sending and receiving non-consensual TMSIs was discordant in the KNP and S contexts: both women and men received more non-consensual TMSIs from KNPs and Ss than the other-gender reported sending. Our findings suggest that gendered sexual scripts are evident in some, but not all, aspect of other-gender attracted women and men's compliant and non-consensual TMSI experiences.

Finding valid tools to measure race-based discrimination, a form of racism, is necessary to accurately assess the effectiveness of programs aimed to reduce those experiences. Objectives Our objective was to evaluate measurement invariance of a race-based discrimination scale by gender among a sample of youth (ages 13–19) from historically marginalized groups and to assess associations of race-based discrimination with sexual violence victimization and perpetration. Methods We used pooled cross-sectional baseline data from two sexual violence prevention programs from 2015 to 2019.

The #MeToo movement has raised awareness regarding sexual harassment, abuse, and assault in the workplace to historical highs. Concurrently, the movement has stimulated a greater interest in understanding forces in the workplace which hinder or promote the advancement of women. Insight into the types of experiences that women have in corporate, academic, nonprofit, and government workplaces, as well as how these experiences have and will be shaping career and life choices is critical to expanding understanding. Our hope is that such renewed interest and expanding insight will lead to useful revelations regarding how, where, and when women experience hostile, unwelcoming, or otherwise difficult working conditions that ultimately lead them away from engineering, into other roles whether they remain in the workforce or exit it altogether. Engineering, with its historically stubborn gender gap, is of particular interest to researchers as the cultures, habits, and behavioral patterns that underlie many engineering work environments may limit how the participation of women at all levels can be broadened and improved.

Factors associated with intimate partner economic violence against female micro-entrepreneurs in Peru,"Asencios-Gonzalez, Z.; Vara-Horna, A.; McBride, J.B.; Santi-Huaranca, I.; Chafloque-Cespedes, R.; Diaz Rosillo, A.","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the prevalence of economic violence against women, specifically in formal sector micro-firms managed by women in Peru, a key Latin American emerging market. Additionally, the authors have identified the demographic characteristics of the micro-firms, financing and credit associated with women who suffer economic violence. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, a structured questionnaire was administered to a representative sample nationwide (357 female micro-entrepreneurs). Findings - The authors found that 22.2 percent of female micro-entrepreneurs have been affected by economic violence at some point in their lives, while at the same time 25 percent of respondents have been forced by their partner to obtain credit against their will. Lower education level, living with one’s partner, having children, business location in the home, lower income, not having access to credit, not applying credit to working capital needs, late payments and being forced to obtain credit against one’s will were all factors associated with economic violence. Furthermore, the results showed a significant correlation between suffering economic violence and being a victim of other types of violence (including psychological, physical or sexual); the highest correlation was with serious physical violence (r=0.523, p<0.01). Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is that the authors measured economic violence only in terms of misappropriation or theft of funds from the business, but not in terms of exacting control over economic resources, which can be a way of depriving the micro-entrepreneur of her autonomy in the management of the business. Practical implications - The authors hope that the findings and conclusions reported here might open a renewed debate among academia, financial service providers, micro-firms, civil society and the public sector, providing a conceptual framework and a starting point to design effective, integrated and inter-sectoral prevention efforts. Social implications - The authors recommend that efforts to reduce intimate partner violence be strengthened, taking into account the issue of gender inequality. It is not sufficient that social policy solely be designed to eliminate violence.

Using the modified Social Ecological Model for Young Women’s Vulnerability to HIV Infection, the study investigates the contextual and broader structural factors, their interactions within and across multiple levels, and how they influence the sexual behaviors of individual young women in ways that increase their vulnerability to contracting HIV. The objectives of the study are: 1) Evaluate individual-level factors associated with sexual risk-taking behavior, specifically having unprotected sex, among young women ages 15–35 years; 2) Describe contextual and broader structural factors that make young women vulnerable to HIV-related risky sexual behaviors, and assess how these contextual factors interact with individual-level factors in ways that perpetuate high levels of HIV infection; and 3) Re-examine the connection between poverty and other economic factors to risky sexual behavior and vulnerability in the context of high HIV transmission among young women. The study used mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, combining household surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews.Household survey results show that risky sexual behavior i.e., having sex without a condom, is still high (over 48%) among the unmarried young women ages 15–35 years. Engagement in unprotected sex increased by age, with young adults reporting more unprotected sex encounters than adolescent girls. Those with primary or some secondary education were at an increased risk of having unprotected sex. Surprisingly, women with tertiary education were at higher risk of engaging in unprotected sex than those who had completed secondary education. Negative binomial regression analyses show that women with no employment and those with part-time employment were at an increased risk for unprotected sex compared to those with low paying but stable employment. These findings on education and HIV risk call for a careful reexamination of the link between higher education and HIV vulnerability to inform policy. Education policies and interventions need to focus on curricula that incorporate entrepreneurial skills at different educational levels from primary to college. Keeping girls in school under the protective eye of parents, guardians and teachers is key in reducing exposure to unprotected sex among young girls.Findings from the qualitative analysis revealed that sociocultural and structural factors, including social norms (premarital sex as taboo, early marriage pressures, subornation of girls and women), youth unfriendly HIV services (e.g., long waiting times, rude and unprofessional clinic staff), high unemployment rates, sexual harassment, exploitation by male employers, and discrimination were key factors perceived to drive risky sexual behavior in relation to HIV contraction among young women. The findings show that while many young women, especially those with children, engaged in risky transactional sexual behavior to meet basic needs, many younger women, including college-level ones, did so to meet materialistic wants and to fit-in with peers.Widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) caused complacency among young people. HIV was no longer perceived as life threatening due to ARVs, which prevent progression into full-blown AIDS, morbidity and death. In fact, some young women were more scared of getting pregnant than contracting HIV. We suggest that efforts to reduce new HIV infections among young women and young men should target individual risk perception, and balance HIV treatment and prevention messages.Findings reveal a complex mix of dynamic and interacting factors operating at different levels that create context specific sexual behavioral risk socioscapes that sustain or accentuate the high rates of new HIV infections among the young women. Using a Social Ecological Model for Young Women’s Vulnerability to HIV as a guiding framework, we contend that efforts for addressing the high HIV infections among young women, including sexual behavioral change interventions, economic empowerment programs, should not only aim at individual women but also target factors operating at the sociocultural and structural levels.

Gender Diversity of Graphics Conference Leadership,"Jacobson, Alec","Non-male identifying researchers, including women and non-binary individuals, are underrepresented in leadership roles within computer graphics conferences.

The goal of the following data collection is to provide grounded statistics to inform future decision making. Recognizing even small successes from the past may inspire and accelerate future improvement. The academic community's recent failure to sufficiently address sexual harassment and malevolent behavior from members of our community (e.g. [Obr 2023]) is an urgent reminder to improve.

Integration of Gender Equality in the Trafsaf Erasmus + Project,"Petrovic, A.R.; Gospic, N.M.; Arsic, N.B.; Lindov, O.S.","Globally, when accessing and driving in public transport vehicles, women have a problem with fear, experiences of sexual harassment and violence. Women's daily trips are very different from those made by men. These factors make a woman more vulnerable, as standard public transport companies do not consider these characteristics enough. The safe public transport option also helps increase the number of women in economic activities. The way of traveling determines the type of work or shift that the woman will accept. Mobility provides women with financial strength and independence, and currently access to safe public transport, both in Sarajevo Canton and throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it can be said that it is not at a satisfactory level in the region, so urgent actions need to be taken. The concept for the implementation of gender equality within the Erasmus + TRAFSAF project, modeled on EU projects, is that all project partners, both those coming from the segment of higher education and NGOs, keep gender statistics and that measures to promote enrollment must be provided.

WPS has removed a few barriers and expanded opportunities, but it is a pacing challenge to implement worldwide. Recognizing the importance of WPS to U.S. national interests, the Biden-Harris administration is attempting to advance WPS Strategy Lines of Effort (LOE). More recently, President Joe Biden established the Gender Policy Council (GPC) in 2021 to emphasize the importance of gender equality and to incorporate WPS principles in current policies, action plans, daily operations, and national partnerships. This paper will argue that the current administration needs to move faster to advance the following LOEs: 1) participation in decision-making and peacebuilding, 2) protection of human rights, 3) improving internal capabilities, and 4) creating partnership engagement. Out of these four LOEs, it is especially important to consider efforts taken, significant challenges, and viable recommendations on the way forward in LOEs one, two, and four.

Understanding female STEM faculty experiences of subtle gender bias from microaggressions perspective,"Yang, Yang Lydia; Carroll, Doris Wright","Research has repeatedly discussed the lack of women in many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. It has been suggested that the ""chilly climate"" feeling unwelcomed or discriminated-pushes women away from STEM fields. This leads to many women leave STEM fields at multiple stages, thus creating the ""leaking pipeline"" phenomenon. The experiences of women who remained and are established in STEM fields are under examined. This study used microaggressions theory to understand STEM women's experiences in academia. This study examined the degree to which women faculty in STEM disciplines experience subtle gender bias and whether such experiences differed based on their ranking, position track, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants were 57 women who were instructional, clinical, and/or research faculty in a broad range of STEM disciplines from a Midwestern land grant university. Subtle gender bias was measured by two instruments, which consisted of 29 items and asked the extent to which participants agreed with statements regarding gender-based microaggression events on a 7-point scale. The instruments included three aspects/factors of gendered microaggressions: (1) Sexual Objectification, (2) Silenced and Marginalized, and (3) Assumptions of Inferiority. Participants were asked to identify their position title, position track, age, and ethnicity. The scores on three aspects/factors of gendered microaggressions were calculated by averaging across items that loaded on each factor with the range of 1-7, with higher scores indicating higher frequency of the experience being asked. On Sexual Objectification, 25% of the participants who responded agreed they either experienced stereotypes of women or were objectified on their physical appearance. On Silenced and Marginalized, 40% of those who responded agreed they were either ignored in a professional setting or had been challenged regarding their authority. Similarly, on Assumptions of Inferiority, 25% of the participants who responded agreed they experienced being told women's work would be inferior to men's work or being told she was too assertive or sassy. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggested that women faculty differed in gendered microaggressions experiences based on their ranking, position track, age, and ethnicity. This study provided a greater understanding of how women faculty perceive and encounter gender-based microaggressions in various STEM fields. The results contribute to gender equity issues for the STEM disciplines where women are under-represented and under-valued. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",2016,,,2016-June,,,,,,#710,Yang 2016,"",""

An Exploration of SETA in Cyber Bullying to Reduce Social Harm & Juvenile Suicide,"Squillace, Joseph; Hozella, Zakkary; Cappella, Justice; Sepp, Andrew","Cyberbullying is direct action harassment that negatively impacts everyone involved. As a societal concern, cyber-attacks and cyberbullying as a threat remains largely unsolved. Due to the challenging nature of the growing intersectionality between perpetrators, victims, and society, cyberbullying disproportionately affects marginalized individuals and adolescent age children, and continues to have a detrimental impact on juvenile victims, their friends, families, and academic institutions. As a threat, cyberbullying has become weaponized by attackers to target and inflict maximum pain and suffering on victims based on a variety on individualistic differences, including varying social identities, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, and social status. To ensure attack success, the bully in a cyber-attack (cyberbullying) will introduce a series of prolonged, continuous procession of abuse designed to inflict adverse effects on the physical, psychological, and mental health of the victim.Long-term abuse suffered as a direct result of a cyberbullying attack has led to irreparable mental health concerns, challenges in classroom and work activities, victim self-harm, and tragically suicide, regardless of victim age. This unfortunate realization highlights the need for more work to be done to protect our youth. Moreover, the continued misidentification, misclassification, and incorrect definition of what is a cyberbullying attack has led to inadequate and inefficient implementation of effective training solutions and prevention policies to designed to combat cyberbullying concerns, leading to a significant negative impact on victims' overall mental health, well-being, and quality of life. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,,,,477-480,,10.1109/AIIoT58121.2023.10174526,,#716,Squillace 2023,"",""

Graduate engineering students changing labs due to experiences of bias,"Bahnson, M.; Wyer, M.; Cass, C.; Kirn, A.","This WIP research paper describes the experiences of engineering graduate students (EGSs) who changed labs following experiences of bias in graduate engineering education. Experiences of bias may contribute to EGS leaving the field of engineering. As part of a larger multiphase research project to explore the influence of bias on EGS engineering identity (EI), qualitative interviews (n = 30) were conducted exploring EGSs’ experiences of bias. These interviews engaged participants in discussions about their social and personal identities (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity) and explored their perceptions of and experiences with bias. This study focuses on four participants who discussed changing research labs in response to experiences of bias. This paper describes data from these participants as it relates to their experiences of bias, lab change, and differences in their new labs, highlighting the nature of bias experiences and their pervasive effects. Participants described experiences of bias leading them to change their research lab. They reported experiences with advisors, peers, and other faculty that made them feel unwelcome in engineering as a field due to their race or gender. Feelings of not belonging in a lab led this sample of EGS to change labs in an attempt to remain in engineering while removing themselves from negative experiences. We argue that institutions should provide opportunities, understanding, and guidance for students to change labs, and briefly discuss how this might be accomplished. Overall, we offer a perspective that has not been explored in the engineering education literature – specifically, changing labs as an alternative to dropping out or leaving the field in response to experiences of bias.",2019,/,,,,5 pp.,,10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028483,,#720,Bahnson 2019,"",""
Creating a gender-inclusive mining industry: Uncovering the challenges of female mining stakeholders,"Kansake, Bruno Ayaga; Sakyi-Addo, Georgette Barnes; Dumakor-Dupey, Nelson Kofi","The global mining industry is male dominated. In the US, women constitute 13% of the mining workforce and 16% of mining related college programs. Similar trends exist globally. Efforts are being made by educational institutions, mining companies and professional organizations to attract women to the industry to achieve a gender inclusive industry. Such efforts have yielded minimal dividends partly due to insufficient reliable data on challenges confronting female miners. To provide empirical data to guide such efforts, we undertook a survey to understand the reasons for low female participation in the industry with participants from Ghana, USA, Ireland, Canada and other countries. The survey sought to identify challenges faced by female mining stakeholders and availability of support facilities for handling these challenges. Open and closed ended questionnaires were administered through online platforms. The responses were analyzed quantitatively using summary statistics and qualitatively using thematic analysis. About 38% of the respondents expressed satisfaction with their current jobs. The high dissatisfaction rate stems from lower salaries compared to male counterparts (29%), gender-based discrimination (53%), sexual harassment (37%) and sexual demands during hiring (17%). The key hindrances to a gender inclusive mining sector have been grouped into seven themes including discrimination, harassment, gender ideologies, and lack of support.

Promoting an inclusive lab culture through custom in-person trainings within an engineering department,"Volpatti, Lisa R.; Rodby, Kara; Singh, Gurleen Kaur; Kaushal, Bianca; Adams, Kelley Marie; Hammond, Paula T.; Rankin, Sarah","Creating diverse, inclusive, and respectful environments is the #1 recommendation of the 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on 'Sexual Harassment of Women' [1]. To accomplish this goal, the report suggests that academic institutions cater their training to specific populations, use qualified, in-person trainers, and instruct participants how to intervene. These recommendations motivated a chemical engineering department at a technical institute to develop a custom in-person training program in collaboration with the Title IX and Bias Response (T9BR) and the Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) offices. The in-person trainings, entitled 'Promoting a Professional and Inclusive Lab Culture,' were mandatory for all laboratory groups in the department, including faculty, staff, and trainees. To promote discussion and interaction within the context of individual lab cultures, training sessions were small (~20 participants) and grouped lab members together. The trainings were facilitated by members of the T9BR and VPR offices and covered aspects of a culture (including values and beliefs, verbal expressions, and behaviors), contexts of power, methods of intervening, and resources/support. The 120-minute sessions included presentation, interactive activities, and realistic example scenarios customized to the department with the goal of promoting respectful work behavior. Approximately 480 individuals participated in the training, representing 33 lab groups in a total of 28 sessions held over the course of 8 months. Exit survey results indicate that 95% of participants felt there was a good mix of presentation and interactivity and 93% felt that the content was neither too basic nor too advanced.

Virtual scenarios include digital characters that reproduce human actions. Generally, these characters are modeled as males and restricted roles are assigned to females. Our objective is to evaluate how the character gender of a victim in a scenario created to practice the cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol (CPR) affects performance of student nurses. Methods: Three virtual scenarios with cardiac arrest victims modeled as males or females were assigned to 41 students of the Nursing Faculty to practice the CPR protocol. We evaluated student performance with respect to the time to remove clothes, the time to perform the CPR maneuver, and the hands position for CPR. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and Mann-Whitney U were used to test primary outcome measures in the experimental design of victim character sex (male vs. female) and student sex (men vs. women). Results: The analysis performed did not find statistically differences in time to remove clothes or in time to start CPR. With respect to hands placement we also did not find significant difference in any of the cases. Conclusion: Nurse student actions are not influenced by the character gender of the victim.

The membership's experiences of inclusion, belonging, professional opportunities, discrimination, microaggressions, racism, and harassment in their professional lives are presented. Methods and Materials: The ethics-reviewed survey was distributed in English and French to full members of COMP. Participants responded to questions covering demographics and professional climate. Simple descriptive statistics were used to measure frequency of responses. Data pertaining to impressions on the climate within the profession were compared using nonparametric statistical tests. Results: The survey was distributed to 649 eligible members; 243 (37%) responded, and 214 (33%) provided full response sets. From the full response sets, findings showed that in general, age, highest academic degree, and racial and ethnic distribution trends of medical physicists were comparable with previously collected data and/or the Canadian population. The experiences of respondents relating to harassment in the workplace and perception of climate are reported and provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of interventions or training programs. In the workplace, fewer women (58%) reported having professional opportunities compared with men (70%). The survey also found that 17% of respondents (most of whom were women) directly or indirectly experienced sexual harassment in the workplace within the past 5 years. Finding that 23% of survey respondents identified as having a disability is a valuable reminder that accommodations in the workplace are necessary for more than 1 in every 5 medical physicists working in clinics. Conclusions: This study provided insight into the diversity and experiences of medical physicists in Canada. The majority of respondents had positive perceptions about their professional environment.

"A queer of color challenge to neutrality in undergraduate stem pedagogy as a white, cisheteropatriarchal space","Leyva, L.A.; Mcneill, R.T.; Duran, A.","Higher education research has documented that racism and cisheteropatriarchy overlap to shape barriers and support opportunities for undergraduate queer and trans* students of color (QTSOC). However, research specific to STEM pedagogical practices (e.g., curricular design, classroom instruction, student support) is missing from this literature, which can provide discipline-specific insights on affirming classroom practices for this population. Reform in undergraduate STEM curriculum and instruction has largely focused on supporting all students, which upholds the guise of neutrality while leaving unchallenged the interlocking functions of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy. As a response to the JWM themed issue's call for reimagining STEM higher education research, this position paper proposes a queer of color research agenda to generate alternative approaches for undergraduate pedagogy that disrupt the violence of neutrality in STEM. Our agenda makes a twofold contribution. First, we extend research on racism and misogyny in undergraduate STEM classrooms by exploring how cisheteropatriarchy informs variation in racially minoritized students' experiences of pedagogical practices when considering minoritized gender and sexual identities.

"Differences in family climate and family communication among cyberbullies, cybervictims, and cyber bully-victims in adolescents","Buelga, S.; Martinez-Ferrer, B.; Cava, M.-J.","Scientific studies on family factors related to the main cyberbullying roles are still scarce. The present study analyzed family climate and parent-adolescent communication in the four roles involved in cyberbullying: cybervictims, cyberbullies, cyberbully-victims, and non-involved adolescents. The study had two main objectives: (1) to analyze the differences in family climate (cohesion and conflict) and communication patterns with the mother and father (open, avoidance, and offensive) among the four roles, controlling the variables sex and academic grade; and (2) to determine the predictive weight of these family variables in the roles involved in cyberbullying. A battery of instruments was applied to 1062 adolescents from 12 to 18 years old. The results revealed that the cyberbully-victim profile had the lowest quality family climate and family communication patterns. In addition, family conflict predicted the role of cyberbullies, and non-open communication with the mother and avoidant communication with the father predicted the role of cybervictim. Finally, these family variables together (conflict and non-open and avoidant communication) predicted the role of cyberbully-victim.

The Relationship between Cyberbullying and Mental Health among University Students,"Ali, S.I.; Shahbuddin, N.B.","Background: The term 'cyberbullying' is linked to traditional bullying, and both refer to oppression. This study aimed to determine the overall effects of cyberbullying on mental health among university students of various ages, and to investigate the extent to which victims (students) directed less attention and focus towards their academic achievement. Methods: The participants in this study were 326 male and female students from King Faisal University in the Al-Ahsa Governorate. The researchers in this study employed the descriptive correlative approach. Results: The study's findings revealed that there were substantial variations in the categories of sex, academic specialty (medical and non-medical students), and family economic status, in relation to cyberbullying surveys. In addition, there was a significant negative relationship between cyberbullying and mental health. Conclusions: It is highly recommended that, in order to prevent cyberbullying, people of all generations need to be made aware of it via specific programs in different public areas, for example, in schools, colleges, and malls, and on social media.",2022,/,Sustainability,14,11,6881 (14 pp.),,10.3390/su14116881,,#732,Ali 2022,"",""
KeyNote: A girl in the man-on-the-moon program: Camaraderie and discrimination in the Apollo era,"Hornstein, Rhoda Shaller","The author reported for duty 51 years ago, in the summer of 1968, to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, one month after graduating with honors from the University of Maryland. Her position was entry level Aerospace Technologist (AST), within the Data Operations Branch of the Manned Flight Planning and Analysis Division. Her duties included the testing and development of the Goddard Real Time System (GRTS) to assure operational readiness for Apollo missions, beginning with Apollo 7. Her role in Apollo 11 was to operate the GRTS to record radar data from the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN) tracking sites and use this data to update the orbit and send out acquisition messages to the MSFN. The author's fondest memory of the Apollo program, especially Apollo 11, was that, with less than one year of Government service, she had the opportunity to work among the ""giants"" of NASA to contribute to the success of something that had never been done before. The awe and wonder of Apollo continued past the moon landing in 1969, through the entire program, including the Apollo-Soyuz Test Program in 1975. The ""Apollo Mentality"" guided the author through 46 years at NASA, encompassing the highs of camaraderie and the lows of discrimination. The camaraderie lasted one year until a manager asked why she was not pregnant. Thus began the discrimination, more specifically gender harassment. This paper addresses how the ""girl"" accommodated the conflicting behaviors through the lens of the ""Apollo Mentality"" during her NASA tenure.

"Building community, providing scholarships, developing leaders: Recruiting and retaining underrepresented students in engineering and computer engineering departments (WIP)","Crick, Kent A.; Seipel, Matthew T.; Larson, Lisa M.; Shelley, Mack","The underrepresentation of women and people of color in engineering is well documented in the literature [1]. Women constitute 47% of the overall workforce but only 28% of jobs in science and engineering belong to women. This deficit is particularly noticeable in the fields of computer science and engineering as women comprise just 26% of the computer science workforce and hold only 15% of engineering positions. This gender divide begins to emerge at the undergraduate level, as women earn only 19% and 18% of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering and computer science, respectively [2]. It has been hypothesized that these deficits of women in engineering fields have resulted from social marginalization. Specifically, Flam [3] argued that women experience a chilly climate when entering male-dominated fields. In such a climate, women receive direct and indirect messaging that their gender could be an obstacle to success in the work environment, which causes them to feel unwelcome. In such a climate, women often doubt whether they will be fully included, valued, and respected in the field despite their abilities [4], [5]. Further, women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors report notable levels of gender bias and sexual harassment within the context of their work [6]. Among women in STEM majors, experiences of STEM-related gender bias have been found to be related negatively to their career aspiration and motivation to pursue vocational opportunities in STEM [6]. In addition to messages of being unwelcome in the field, women in STEM fields have also been shown to encounter benevolent sexism (e.g., protective paternalism or gender differentiation) from their male peers [7]. This form of sexism has been linked with lower grade point averages (GPAs) in STEM courses [7]. These findings highlight the impact the academic climate can have on underrepresented students pursuing careers in STEM fields. Because GPA represents a primary achievement measure that carries important implications for one's academic trajectory, efforts to enhance representation of women and people of color in STEM fields can be evaluated using GPA. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",2020,,,2020-June,,Abet; Engineering Unleashed; et al.; Gradescope; IEEE Xplore; Keysight Technologies,,,,#735,Crick 2020,"",""

One purpose of the current study was to examine possible sex differences in perceptions of the prevalence of cybervictimization experiences. The current study also examined whether cybervictimization accounted for additional variance in depression beyond traditional victimization and if social support would buffer the associations among traditional and cyber victimization and depression. Young men and women did not report significantly different rates of cybervictimization. Cybervictimization was significantly related to depression above and beyond that of traditional victimization. Social support was negatively related to depression. However, there was no moderating role of social support. The results of this study highlight the significant impact that traditional and cyber victimization may have on college students' well-being.

Using Virtual Reality to Assess the Efficacy of a Motivational Interviewing Intervention to Increase Bystander Behaviors,"Grandgenett, Hanna M.","Bystander interventions, which train witnesses to intervene to diffuse potentially risky sexual situations, are a common sexual assault prevention approach on college campuses. Current bystander intervention trainings are typically conducted in group sessions involving education about how to recognize and intervene in response to sexual risk situations. Although successful in changing knowledge and attitudes about sexual assault prevention, these programs have mixed success in changing actual bystander behaviors. Furthermore, the majority of bystander trainings are evaluated with self-report measures, which are subject to several limitations such as social desirability bias and inaccurate recall. The present study addressed these limitations by using self-report measures and virtual reality technology to evaluate a new, motivational interviewing (MI) intervention for increasing bystander behaviors to prevent sexual violence. Fifty-seven young adult community members were randomly assigned to complete a motivational interviewing intervention—Motivate-the-Bystander (MTB)— or an assessment only control condition. A series of regression models was utilized to examine whether participants who completed MTB displayed increases in self-reported bystander attitudes, efficacy, and behaviors, along with observed bystander behaviors in our virtual house party (i.e., Bystander in Sexual Assault Virtual Environment; BSAVE). This project also examined whether participant factors (i.e., gender, rape myth acceptance, alcohol use) moderated the efficacy of the intervention on bystander outcomes. Findings indicate that, compared to control participants, participants who completed MTB displayed increases in self-reported bystander attitudes, efficacy, and behaviors. Furthermore, the positive relations between MTB and self-reported bystander attitudes and efficacy were weakened to the extent that participants more strongly endorsed rape myths. Unexpectedly, experimental condition was not related to their observed bystander behaviors in the virtual environment. Knowledge gained from this study may enhance the development of bystander programs, as the study suggests promise for an individualized, motivational interviewing bystander intervention to improve bystanders’ attitudes and behaviors. Findings also underscore the need for additional research on the unique measurement constraints of different bystander measures (e.g., self-report, virtual reality).

Operationalizing gendered transportation preferences: A psychological framework incorporating time constraints and risk aversion,"Shirgaokar, Manish","The negative outcomes of ingrained gender socialization are evident in many contemporary societies. For example, women spend more time on home care and child rearing tasks than men do. A key impact of gender-based roles, hence, is larger time constraints for women compared to men. Additionally, in some countries women are exposed to daily sexual harassment during day-to-day travel. With the maturing of a middle class in the emerging economies, however, women are gaining financial independence. This has translated to gender-specific travel preferences, which remain understudied. I ask: how do gender-based preferences about time constraints and risk aversion express themselves in the travel choices of young adults? The research relies on purposive sampling where 154 participants at various stages of their young adult lives were recruited for 21 gender-separated focus groups. The sample includes graduate students and early/mid-career professionals in Mumbai. The aim was to explore reasons for differences in the travel behaviors of middle-class, college-educated, professional women and men. Relative to the larger population, this demographic group is less likely to have differences in travel preferences by gender. Yet the evidence suggests that time limitations and physical safety are experienced and expressed differently by each gender. For example, women speak more about safety than about time. I propose a psychological framework to expand transportation research by systematically investigating and incorporating such gendered travel preferences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Transport Policy,75,,10-18,,10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.12.010,,#740,Shirgaokar 2019,"",""

Documents retrieval for qualitative research: gender discrimination analysis,"Alatrista-Salas, H.; Hidalgo-Leon, P.; Nunez-del-Prado, M.","Gender discrimination is an act of exclusion or differential treatment towards a person due to its sex. This phenomenon has been studied in qualitative research by seeking to analyze and to describe the reality and context of discrimination. Qualitative researchers use a collection of documents such as surveys, interviews among another source. These large full textual documents tend to be unstructured from a Data Science point of view. These data are often complex and tend to show similar information between documents. Nevertheless, the process of selecting relevant information is manual, generating difficulties in categorizing and analyzing relevant piece of information, such as victim’s surveys. The main reason in this processing is the use of tools to simplify the task of information selection and to perform it efficiently. This article proposes two methods based on the TF-IDF measure to search documents in a corpus. Our findings show that other methods such as, LSA (Latent Semantics Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) consume a lot of memory, and have a low effectiveness extracting meaningful words than relying on TD-IDF only.

Behind the Counter: Exploring the Motivations and Barriers of Online Counterspeech Writing,"Ping, K.; Kumar, A.; Ding, X.; Rho, E.","Current research mainly explores the attributes and impact of online counterspeech, leaving a gap in understanding of who engages in online counterspeech or what motivates or deters users from participating. To investigate this, we surveyed 458 English-speaking U.S. participants, analyzing key motivations and barriers underlying online counterspeech engagement. We presented each participant with three hate speech examples from a set of 900, spanning race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and disability, and requested counterspeech responses. Subsequent questions assessed their satisfaction, perceived difficulty, and the effectiveness of their counterspeech. Our findings show that having been a target of online hate is a key driver of frequent online counterspeech engagement. People differ in their motivations and barriers towards engaging in online counterspeech across different demographic groups. Younger individuals, women, those with higher education levels, and regular witnesses to online hate are more reluctant to engage in online counterspeech due to concerns around public exposure, retaliation, and third-party harassment. Varying motivation and barriers in counterspeech engagement also shape how individuals view their own self-authored counterspeech and the difficulty experienced writing it. Additionally, our work explores people's willingness to use AI technologies like ChatGPT for counterspeech writing.

Empowering Engineering Students as Allies Through Dedicated Classroom Instruction,"Abrams, Lisa; Jayakumar, Adithya; Sheppard, Lucille; Kramer, Amy; Calbert, Toni M.","Women* and other minoritized groups experience an unwelcoming environment in higher education [1-5]. This is particularly acute in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields, where students have reported experiencing both explicit and subtle biased behaviors by faculty, administrators and fellow students [6-12]. The behaviors include stereotypical comments about women and other minoritized students' abilities, microaggressions, sexist humor, etc. Studies have shown that such behavior can lead to negative cognitive effects which in turn can affect student retention and graduation rates [13-15]. The aim of this paper is to document the progression and results of efforts undertaken at The Ohio State University to make the climate more welcoming for minoritized students in the College of Engineering (COE) by offering a course that encourages ally development. Ally development involves training people in the dominant social group and helping them understand the inequities placed on those in the minority [16-17]. This is especially crucial to have in engineering, where on average, the percentage of women receiving a bachelor's degree in the United States is 20.9%. Similarly, the percentage of Hispanic students receiving a bachelor's degree in the United States is 11.4%, Black/African American students is 4.2%, Native American students is.3%, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students is.2% [18]. Ally development, based on the framework created by Broido [19] hypothesizes that engaging students from the dominant group as allies to promote equity in engineering is an innovative strategy for creating a positive climate for minoritized students - and, in turn, ALL students - a factor that influences their retention and graduation rates [20-21]. This initiative started as an informal cohort in 2015-2016 -training students, who identify as men, to be allies for other students. The primary focus of the cohort was on gender. This cohort met weekly to learn about power, privilege, bias, and microaggressions. The participants then developed and implemented outreach activities in the university community. Taking the positive aspects of the cohort, a semester-long course was developed and offered every semester for undergraduate men students around the cohort concepts. Shortly thereafter a complementary class, for students who identify as women, was developed with similar topics as well as additions including confidence and empowerment. In Autumn 2018 the men and women's courses were rebranded as ""Inclusive Leadership"" courses with topics including personal brand, strengths, values, identity, power, privilege, bias, and microaggressions. The focus extended beyond gender to include race, sexual orientation, physical ability, and other categories of social identity. Gender non-binary students had the opportunity to choose between either of the two courses. In Autumn 2019, the courses' enrolled students were limited to new first year engineering students who self-selected to take part in a pilot ""Inclusive Leadership Cohort"". Students in this cohort took the Inclusive Leadership Course concurrently with the first two required engineering courses in their first two semesters at The Ohio State University. Due to COVID, in Autumn 2020, the courses went back to being open to all undergraduate engineering students. Finally, for the Spring of 2021, a single non-gender specific course was offered for the first time. This paper documents the perceived impact on the students who took the courses, lessons learned in each stage of the initiative, and the initial progress on the first non-gender specific Inclusive Leadership Course offered in Spring 2021. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",2021,,,,,,,,,#747,Abrams 2021,"",""
The portia hypothesis: Mechanical engineering student perceptions of qualifications,"McCue, Leigh S.","The Portia Hypothesis, named for Shakespeare's Portia in The Merchant of Venice who disguises herself as a man so as to be able to participate in legal proceedings, postulates that individuals with masculine first names are more likely to be successful in legal professions. Various studies have demonstrated this effect in hiring for legal (Coffey & McLaughlin, 2009), musical (Goldin and Rouse, 1997), academic psychology (Steinpreis et al, 1999), and STEM fields (Moss-Racusin et al, 2012; Davidson, 2015) amongst others (Acosta and Callahan, n.d.). Racial discrimination has been similarly demonstrated in resume reviews (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003; Oreopoulos, 2011; Turczynski, 2019). Racial and/or gender bias is apparent in letters of recommendation (Dutt et al, 2016; Schmader et al, 2007; Trix & Psenka, 2003), awarding of research grants (Ginther et al, 2011), standards of competence (Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997), performance evaluations (Sackett, 1991), and hiring (Georgi, 2000; Sagaria, 2002). Students are victims of these biases, resulting in stereotype threat potentially effecting field selection (Storage et al, 2016), classroom performance (Keller, 2007), and creating a perception amongst some students that they need to whiten their resumes (Kang et al, 2016) to be competitive in their job search. At the same time, students continue to propagate these biases. As noted in a recent Physics Today article on student evaluations of teaching (SETs), The degree of disparity varies by discipline, course, level, institution, and other factors, but across the board, SETs penalize women, underrepresented minorities, nonnative English speakers, and older and physically less attractive instructors of both sexes, (Feder, 2020). It is therefore of great interest to better understand the conscious or unconscious biases present in modern day students with respect to race and gender. Through understanding the biases of current students, one can better anticipate the intervention needs of the future workforce. For example, a recent study of nursing and psychology students identified an implicit bias against overweight individuals which enabled identification of possible nursing curricular revisions, such as teaching future nurses about the experiences of obese patients and methods to communicate evidence-based recommendations for weight loss without stigmatizing patients, (Waller et al, 2012). Study of engineering student race and gender biases prior to entering the workforce will help inform educational interventions that may be taken to mitigate long-term effects of such biases on the workforce of the future. With that in mind, and to frame a classroom discussion on diversity and inclusion, students in a required senior-level Mechanical Engineering course at George Mason University were provided one of two resumes to review. The two resumes contained either a typically female or male first name but were otherwise identical. When asked to provide both quantitative and qualitative assessment of qualifications of the two candidates, participating students gave the female resume lower quantitative marks and honed in on non-technical and language skills more so than they did in their evaluations of the male candidate. This paper presents the findings of this initial study and outlines a path toward a more comprehensive look at gender-bias in engineering student perceptions of qualifications. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",2020,,,2020-June,,Abet; Engineering Unleashed; et al.; Gradescope; IEEE Xplore; Keysight Technologies,,,,#748,McCue 2020,"",""

Personal Injury Assessment in the Setting of Road Traffic Accidents. Contribution to Older Adults and Children's Medico-Legal Evaluation,"da Cunha Diniz, Flavia","General introduction:Road traffic accidents (RTA) represent a severe problem with a high health, social, legal, and economic impact on victims, their families, and society as a whole. RTA produce millions of deaths worldwide annually, and the RTA’s non-fatal injuries victims have significant short- and long-term consequences, affecting their functionality and quality of life. The posttraumatic personal injury assessment (PIA) is a relevant moment of intervention in these cases. In addition to contributing to the fair and proper repair of damages (from a legal perspective), it also contributes to health promotion. Health promotion occurs through the perception, by the victims and their family members, that justice has been done, as well as through the medico-legal expertise contribution ensuring the victim’s rehabilitation and family, social and professional, or training reintegration (according to the case). However, there are several situations where PIA is particularly complex, and guidelines are unavailable. An example of these cases is the assessment at the extreme of age: in older adults and children.Objectives:This study has the general objective of producing evidence on the differences and specificities of posttraumatic outcomes in non-fatal RTA cases of older adults and children, aiming to better guide personal injury assessment (PIA) in these cases and to contribute to the elaboration of future guidelines in each age group. The specific objectives are, for victims of non-fatal RTA: (a) to analyse the temporary and permanent outcomes, considering the victim’s age group and sex, using Portuguese medico-legal rules for PIA; (b) to analyse the differences between older adults and young- and middle-aged adults populations; (c) to analyse the differences between children and young- and middle-aged adult populations.Material and methods: Three retrospective studies were conducted using convenience samples based on medico-legal reports of PIA cases in civil law related to RTA victims performed in a Portuguese insurance company. The database for each of the studies was prepared by the physician who supervised this investigation and who performed most of the expertise. For the studies, three age groups were considered: (a) children (64 years). In the first study, a total population of 667 individuals was used. For the second and third studies, samples from young- and middle-aged adults were matched with samples from older adults (n=239) and children (n=114), respectively, considering the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Generally, the inclusion criteria were the following: (a) final medical-legal report about RTA victims, with the causal link between the trauma and the damage established; (b) executed at a healthcare unit of a Portuguese insurance company; (c) occurred between 2018 and 2020; and (d) performed by three selected physicians, with specialisation in forensic medicine and a high experience in PIA, to assure data reliability. The three-dimensional methodology was used to describe the permanent consequences and to quantify the severity of sequelae in the Inventory for Handicap Assessment. The rules of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal were followed to quantify the damage’s temporary and permanent parameters.

"The early career, gender, and diversity actions within the LHCb Collaboration (poster)","Sciascia, Barbara; Rademacker, Jonas","Numerous surveys of modern particle physics indicate that the discipline is still largely a male pursuit, and one in which women and other marginalised groups continue to face discriminatory practices. The fraction of female particle physicists reduces with each career stage. Early career particle physicists face precarious employment conditions with serial short term contracts, long working hours, the frequent need to relocate, and little prospect for a permanent academic position. There are indications that these employment conditions add to the gender-imbalance in the field, but clearly, this problem directly affects both male and female early career scientists. The LHCb experiment has, as the first (and so far only) LHC experiment, created a dedicated office for Early Career Gender and Diversity (ECGD) The ECGD office's role is to to advise the management on ECGD matters; provide a point of contact for anybody experiencing any kind discrimination, bullying or harassment; collate regular statistics and other relevant information related to gender and, where appropriate, other ECGD matters; organise regular open meetings where ECGD matters are discussed. We report on our first year of experiences as the first ECGD officers in the LHC's first ECGD office. Amongst the pitfalls of such an office is the potential of being perceived as either inconsequential, or as an external body that is a source of new rules and complications. We will highlight the strategies we adopted in an attempt to circumnavigate these pitfalls, aiming to be (and be seen as) an integral part of LHCb, working with the entire collaboration to achieve an environment in which all members can thrive. We will also discuss a few highlights of our programme in that year, including well-attended plenary meetings at LHCb weeks on topics such as ""mentoring"", ""(m/p)aternity leave"", ""sexual harrassment"", ""careers inside and outside HEP"" - and the implementation of a mentoring scheme. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).",2016,,,Part F128556,,,,,,#754,Sciascia 2016,"",""
Changes in undergraduate engineering college climate and predictors of major commitment: Results from climate studies in 2008 and 2015,"Fitzpatrick, Mary E.; Romero, Manuela; Sheridan, Jennifer","This paper presents results of two cross-sectional investigations of educational and interpersonal climate in a college of engineering at a large mid-western university. In 2008 and in 2015 we deployed a survey (""Project to Assess Climate in Engineering"") to undergraduate engineering students. In each survey year, just over 1000 eligible students participated and responded to items contributing to scales rating their professors, teaching assistants, college resources, confidence (self-efficacy) in engineering, student interactions, perceptions of engineering, and commitment to an engineering major. Participants were also asked about experiences of being singled-out based on race or gender, hearing gender or racial stereotypes expressed by faculty or students, sexual harassment and racial harassment. Scale means and some individual items were analyzed for differences by demographic group, and were compared to data collected by the same institution in 2008. Results revealed significant differences in attitudes and experiences from 2008 to 2015 for the entire sample and within demographic groups. For example, experiences of stereotyping and being singled-out due to gender or race were reported at higher rates across all groups in 2015 compared to 2008, while engineering self-efficacy, ratings of professors and student interactions were lower. To investigate the influence of demographic and scale factors on commitment to major, we formed regression equations for each survey year. In 2015, perceptions of engineering, engineering self-efficacy and professor ratings predicted commitment to major. Regression results differed significantly in 2008 and 2015. Among other findings, while underrepresented minority and international status negatively influenced commitment to major in 2008, neither underrepresented minority nor international status had a significant influence on commitment to major in our 2015 sample. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",2016,,,2016-June,,,,,,#755,Fitzpatrick 2016,"",""
Students' and professionals' responses to sexist comments in engineering,"Powell, Beth A.; Wolfe, Joanna","Although there is evidence that most women with long-term careers in STEM will face some form of sexism, there is little research on how to handle such behaviors. Some situations require intervention by those with authority, some can be confronted directly by individuals, and still others should be ignored. To better understand how students and faculty should respond to sexist comments made by one student to another, we interviewed engineering students, professionals, and faculty, asking them to respond to two different real-life scenarios containing sexist comments. We found that three-fourths of professionals and over one-third of students had experienced inappropriate behaviors that could be labeled as sexist. Furthermore, we found major differences in how students and others perceive particular behaviors. For instance, while close to half of professionals and faculty perceived a sexual joke as ""completely inappropriate,"" most students indicated that they would either ignore the comment or joke back because the speaker was not serious and had no malicious intent. By contrast, students were more inclined to confront a comment that most professionals perceived as a minor irritation and not worth the effort of responding. Our findings also indicate that faculty members were both concerned about students encountering inappropriate sexist behaviors and confused about what to do. We did find evidence, though, that sexual harassment training can help faculty respond more effectively to such situations. The faculty at one campus that mandates harassment training every two years were more likely than others to take action and were much more aware of HR policies and proper professional expectations. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.",2015,,,122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Making Value for Society,122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Making Value for Society,,,,,#756,Powell 2015,"",""
A mobile ultrasound system for majority detection,"Hewener, Holger; Risser, Christoph; Brausch, Lukas; Rohrer, Tilman; Tretbar, Steffen","Human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a problem worldwide and the proportion of underage victims is significant. To identify the minority of a person, the measurement of bone age using X-ray imaging is the gold-standard procedure. Beside several technical and judicial problems like radiation, this technique still requires medical diagnosis and limits the acceptance and practicability. Existing ultrasound systems for bone age determination evaluate changes of speed of sound through bone showing unreliable results for majority determining. In this work a mobile ultrasound system for the purpose of fast and reliable majority determination is developed and clinically evaluated using machine learning for classification without the need of a physician trained for age determination. In women, the complete fusion of the distal growth plate in ulna and radius bones correlates with reaching the age of 18. The existence of this growth plate is measured using the developed mobile multichannel ultrasound system. Its main parts are a low cost and low power FPGA, a fully integrated 8 channel transceiver and a WIFI module for data transfer to a mobile device. A pair of ultrasound array transducers (4 elements with 11x11 mm aperture each, 1 MHz center frequency) is positioned and moved up to 15 mm for reflection and transmission measurements through the forearm resulting in measurements of multiple paths through an existing growth plate leading to more robust results. The detection of growth plate existence was done using machine learning approaches. Different types of artificial neural nets were used. The system has been evaluated successfully in a clinical study with 149 women at Saarland University Medical Center. Classical signal processing analyzing the change of ultrasound signals during transducer movement over the growth plate showed that a difference between underage and legal age women is contained in the data, but classification had to be done using machine learning methods. The best performance for binary majority classification was achieved using a ResNet with an F1 score of approximately 84 % showing the capabilities of the setup. Currently, a multi-center study started to increase the number of data used for training the artificial neural nets, improving these results further while adapting the technology even to male subject groups. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,,2019-October,,502-505,,10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8925868,,#757,Hewener 2019,"",""

Cyberbullying aggressors among Spanish secondary education students: an exploratory study,"Buelga, S.; Cava, M.J.; Musitu, G.; Torralba, E.","Purpose – This paper aims to explore the prevalence rate of adolescents engaging in aggressive behaviours towards their peers using the Internet and mobile phones, while examining the duration and intensity of this cyberbullying, and to analyse differences in cyberbullying behaviours based on gender and age (academic grades). Research on cyberbullying indicates that it is a global problem that is increasing dramatically among adolescents. Design/methodology/approach – The sample was composed of 1,415 Spanish adolescents of both sexes (760 boys and 655 girls) between 12 and 17 years old (M = 13.9 years old; SD = 1.4). Findings – The results indicated that the cyberbullying prevalence among adolescents in the past year was 32 per cent. Likewise, the data suggest that boys and students in their fourth year of secondary education (15-17 years old) perpetrated cyberbullying on their peers more than girls and students in lower grades. Research limitations/implications – The results presented in this research should be interpreted with caution due to its cross-sectional nature; a longitudinal study with measurements at different times would help to confirm the results observed here. On the other hand, in this study, the adolescents’ responses were obtained through self-reports and, although they could be subject to social desirability effects and biases, as indicated by Flisher et al. (2004), the reliability and validity of adolescent self-reports in the measurement of risk behaviours were quite acceptable. Practical implications – It is of crucial importance to develop educational strategies designed to favour the responsible use of the new technologies. In many cases, children and adolescents are not aware of psychological and legal consequences that their cyber-aggressions can have on themselves, on the victims and on their families and social environment. Social implications – The authors feel that this research may contribute to clarifying some crucial issues related to the growing problem of cyberbullying that affects adolescents in many countries of the world. As the present research deals with aspects of interactive technology and smart education, the authors believe that the findings reported in the manuscript would be of interest to potential readers of this Journal. Originality/value – This paper is an original perspective on cyberbullying aggressors among secondary education students in a Spanish context.",2015,/,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,12,2,100-15,,10.1108/ITSE-08-2014-0025,,#760,Buelga 2015,"",""

"Defining Harassment in Academic Engineering: A Study of Student, Faculty, and Staff Perceptions","Hedayati-Mehdiabadi, Amir; Moschella-Smith, Elizabeth A.; Htun, Mala","In recent years, the adverse impacts of harassment on career outcomes of women and racial minorities in academic engineering has been increasingly recognized. The way individuals define harassment has important implications for designing prevention programs and the ability of the engineering community to recognize and address this issue. This paper explores how undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty and staff in engineering define harassment in response to open-ended questions. The study is based on semi-structured individual interviews from 102 participants at two research universities in the United States. To build a comprehensive understanding of harassment, content analysis was used to identify themes in participants' responses. We also explored whether and how participants associate harassment with their own identity (e.g., gender, race). Participants recognized three overarching types of harassment: sexual (e.g., unwanted sexual attention), identity-based (e.g., race, gender), and general (i.e., neither sexual nor identity-based). Participants revealed a spectrum of behavioral indicators, including offensive language (e.g., comments, jokes), discrimination, and disrespectful behaviors. Whereas women and men perceived similar behaviors as indicators of harassment, the types of harassment were somewhat related to their social identity and status at the university (e.g., student, faculty). The implications of the findings for future research and practice are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",2022,,,,,,,,,#765,Hedayati-Mehdiabadi 2022,"",""

Gender-based violence in higher education and research: A European perspective,"Bosco Damous, Licia; Guillope, Colette","The gender gap in science is intrinsically linked to gender-based violence in academia. Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination against women that occurs in an academic environment, and it often takes the form of sexual harassment. Some European countries, such as France, Italy, and Ireland, have solid legal systems in place to address sexual harassment in academia. However, as the report of the European Research Area and Innovation Committee Standing Working Group on sexual harassment points out, not all European countries have legislation in this area, or if they do, it is often ineffective. While national surveys generally show that it is difficult to prevent or combat sexual harassment in universities, practices related to corporate social responsibility could be used to start the conversation about the social responsibility of universities to fight against sexual harassment, which is reflected in this article. © 2021 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

Sex Differences in the Ability to Predict and Treat Opiate Abuse.,"Chartoff, E.","Due to improved battlefield medicine, the majority of Soldiers who are wounded survive and treated with prescription opioid painkillers. This award has two goals: to test a novel means (Distress Intolerance) of predicting risk for prescription opioid abuse, and to test a pharmacological compound (CRF receptor antagonist) for prevention of prescription opioid abuse and addiction. We use male and female rats that were exposed to an experimenter-administered regimen of escalating-dose morphine (or saline) injections. This design allows us to be sensitive to sex differences, which exist in human drug abusers, and it allows us to determine if a model of physician-prescribed opioids alters vulnerability to subsequent abuse. In this second year of funding we have completed the first goal and have begun testing the changes to the self-administration paradigm we obtained IACUC and ACURO approval for. Specifically, for Aim 2, we are now going to test the effects of the CRF receptor antatonist antalarmin on escalation of oxycodone intake in a long-access self-administration paradigm. To date, we found that certain measures of Distress Intolerance (e.g., warm water tail flick latency and acoustic startle response) in drug-nave rats were significantly correlated with the amount of oxycodone rats self-administered during the acquisition phase. After completion of Aim 1,we found that prior morphine experience in males, but not females, increased oxycodone self-administration. In conclusion, our findings suggest 1) Distress Intolerance measures can be taken before deployment and used to help decide whether a Soldier would be at risk for developing an opioid use disorder, and 2) prior exposure to, and withdrawal from, a regimen of opioids (administered in a manner akin to a prescription in people) increases vulnerability of males, but not females, to increased addiction-like behavior.",2018,11/,,,,15p,,,,#770,Chartoff 2018,"",""
Examining Risk of Workplace Violence in Canada: A Sex/Gender-Based Analysis,"Lanthier, Stephanie; Bielecky, Amber; Smith, Peter M.","Objectives Workplace violence (WPV) is a serious issue, resulting in significant negative health outcomes. Understanding sex/gender differences in risk of WPV has important implications for primary prevention activities. Methods Utilizing two waves of the Canadian General Social Survey on Victimization (N = 27,643), we examined the likelihood of WPV, and sub-categories of WPV, for women relative to men. Using a sex/gender analytical approach, a series of logistic regression models examined how the associations between being a woman and each of the outcomes changed upon adjustment for work and socio-demographic characteristics. Results After adjustment for work hours, women were at more than twice the risk of WPV compared to men (odds ratio = 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.52-2.95). Adjustment for work characteristics attenuated, but did not eliminate this risk. Differences in associations were observed across sub-categories of violence, with adjustment for work characteristics attenuating sex/gender differences in physical WPV, but having minimal impact on sex/gender differences in sexual WPV. Conclusions Work characteristics explain a substantial proportion of the sex/gender differences in risk of physical WPV. However, even after adjustment for work characteristics, women still showed an elevated risk relative to men for almost all types of violence (as defined by nature of the violence, sex of the perpetrator, and relationship to the perpetrator) examined in this study.

This paper highlights recent research on women EE faculty members at four-year research institutions for those who have an interest in studying women faculty in academic settings. This qualitative study found that women EE faculty members face an alienating, isolated and sometimes hostile work environments. These findings were evident in work processes such as collaboration, networking and mentoring which women EE faculty members faced explicit and implicit bias. Nearly all women EE faculty members experienced emotional harassment while a third experienced physical or sexual harassment in the department or with the promotion and tenure process. Although work-life balance and support from other women could be a positive aspect, sometimes these experiences paralleled the negative department environment. Such work environments can have lasting repercussions for women personally and professionally and negatively impact their experiences with the promotion and tenure process.

Department Climate and the Effect on the Promotion and Tenure Process for Women Faculty Members in Electrical Engineering,"Maynen, Dawn Marie","Women faculty members have an important place in universities in the United States and are without question an elite group of highly educated professionals (Chilly Collective, 1995). Nonetheless, the number of women faculty members represented in all professorial ranks of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields remains disproportionately low (Chilly Collective, 1995; Yoder, 2017). In 2017, Yoder (2017) found the mean percentage of women tenured/tenure-track faculty in all engineering disciplines was 16.9%. That same year, only 14.2% of women faculty members in electrical engineering (EE) were tenured/tenure-track (Yoder, 2017). Moreover, women faculty members in STEM continue to be concentrated in the lower academic ranks, advance slowly through the academic positions and are paid less than male colleagues. These trends are particularly evident in traditional male-dominated academic disciplines such as EE. The underrepresentation and lack of progress of women in STEM can be attributed to factors such as the institutional or department climate and the promotion and tenure process. Studies have examined the effects of institutional climate, promotion and tenure and department climate independently from one another, but have not examined relationships among these factors.The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the effects that institutional and departmental climate, as well as the promotion and tenure process, have on women faculty members experiences in EE departments. Examining the experiences of women faculty members in a specific department, such as electrical engineering, is crucial to understanding the department climate and the promotion and tenure process. The interviews of seven women faculty members from five institutions were utilized in this study. Two contextual themes were identified. Next, seven major themes were explored: collegial and supportive environments, collaboration and networking, mentoring, bias, harassment, and the process of and equity with the promotion and tenure process. Two other themes, work-life balance and support of other women emerged from the interviews providing a final perspective on being women faculty members in an EE department. Significant findings of the study were that women faculty members in EE perceive their environment as collegial at times and isolating and non-supportive at other times. Women had few opportunities to collaborate, and networking and mentoring relationships were often formed outside the EE department and the university. Another finding was women faculty members reported that explicit and implicit bias existed in their departments. Almost all women experienced emotional harassment while less than half experienced physical or sexual harassment. Finally, most faculty members believed the guidelines for promotion and tenure were fair equitable, but women were held to a higher standard. These accounts provide important insights into how women faculty members in EE department experience interactions among institutional climate, departmental climate and the promotion and tenure process.

Beyond the Sex Doll: Post-Human Companionship and the Rise of the ‘Allodoll’,"Langcaster-James, M.; Bentley, G.R.","The increasing market for realistic sex dolls has led to heated debate about future relationships with these entities and whether they could lead to an increasing objectification of women or possibly encourage abuse. However, limited academic research has been carried out on the topic, and little is known about the motivations and experiences of those who purchase and use sex dolls. Therefore, we conducted a mixed methods study of 83 participants, accessed through online doll forums, who completed a 22-item, semi-structured questionnaire. The majority were heterosexual, white, employed, middle-aged males; just over half were not in a current relationship, and approximately half lived alone. A thematic analysis revealed a high prevalence of non-sexual, post-human companionship dynamics between dolls and their owners, as well as reservations by doll owners about future robotic developments. In light of these findings, we suggest a new term, ‘allodoll’, which more accurately reflects the broader, non-sexual relationships of these doll owners, and could broaden the scope of future research. Although sex doll forums may be biased towards certain types of doll users, our findings may allay some of the fears of the more detrimental consequences of sex doll use.",2018,12/,Robotics,7,4,62 (20 pp.),,10.3390/robotics7040062,,#777,Langcaster-James 2018,"",""
Sex and gender role differences in occupational exposures and work outcomes among registered nurses in correctional settings,"Ghaziri, Mazen El; Dugan, Alicia G.; Zhang, Yuan; Gore, Rebecca; Castro, Mary Ellen","Background and context: The correctional environment exposes registered nurses to unique occupational health hazards including, but not limited to, an increased risk for workplace violence. Gender role expectations regarding femininity and masculinity may influence occupational exposures and outcomes differently. Risk comparisons between male and female registered nurses working in correctional settings, have been minimally examined. With the proportion of male registered nurses working in corrections higher than that of nurses working in other healthcare sectors, and with the increasing number of males entering the nursing workforce in general, it is important to characterize and understand occupational exposures and outcomes of male and female registered nurses, especially those working in correctional settings. Purpose/objectives: This paper aims to describe and compare sex and gender role differences in occupational exposures and work outcomes among correctional registered nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey using Qualtrics was administered to registered nurses working in a northeastern correctional healthcare system between June and October 2016. The survey was composed of 71 items from the CPH-NEW Healthy Workplace All Employee Survey, Assessing Risk of Exposure to Blood and Airborne Pathogens and General Health Survey, Bem Sex Role Inventory-Short Form (BSRI-SF), and the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised. Results: Of 95 registered nurse participants, 75% were female with the highest percentage identified as belonging to the feminine group (37%), while the highest percentage of male participants were identified as belonging to the androgynous group (33%). Females worked primarily on the first shift, while males tended to work the second and third shifts (P 95%) reported being at risk for workplace violence and having been victims of workplace violence perpetrated by an inmate.

Implementation of a sexual harassment workshop targeting female engineers,"Volpatti, Lisa Rae; Bodnar, Cheryl A.; Byland, Lauren M.","While sexual harassment (SH) of women in male-dominated fields was the focus of much research after the publication of Catharine MacKinnon's 1979 book, Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination, investigations within this field have become much less frequent in the past decade. Nevertheless, SH continues to be considered an important obstacle in the retention and success of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The workshop developed and implemented as described in this study helped educate female engineering students on how to recognize situations that could be construed as SH through the provision of a range of ""What if..."" scenarios. More importantly, it provided strategies to help female engineering students cope with SH through learning from the experiences of professional panelists with expertise in this area. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), the overall impression of the workshop according to participants who took the evaluation survey was 4.74. Moreover, 100% of the survey participants felt that the workshop met their expectations. Furthermore, questions pertaining to perceived informational needs relative to SH were included in a survey administered to all graduating engineering students of a mid-Atlantic university. Almost half of survey respondents indicated that SH was an issue of concern, and 35% felt that more information on how to identify and cope with SH should be available to them as they enter the workforce, indicative of the need to continue offering workshops such as the one described in this study. By sharing the details and positive results of this inaugural workshop, we hope to instill confidence and provide the support necessary to recognize and address sexual harassment. In this way, we aim to increase the retention and general welfare of female engineers in both academic and industrial workplaces. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.",2014,,,,,Dassault Systemes (DS); et al.; Kaplan; National Instruments; NCEES; Quanser,,,,#779,Volpatti 2014,"",""
Replicable methodology for the creation of anti-harassment policies for independent aerospace student groups as exemplified by the case of TECSpace,"del Barco-Leon, Maria Fernanda; Cordero-Araya, Hellen; Ramos-Con, Patricia; Rodriguez-Delgado, Carlos; Dittel-Tortos, Valeria; Araya-Chacon, Carmen; Ramirez-Arana, Sofia; Mora-Chacon, Maria Francini","Around the world, independent groups and organizations of undergraduate students related to aerospace endeavors are on the surge, especially in emerging countries. These groups face particular challenges, one of them is the lack of existing policies and bylaws that preside over their members and endeavors. This occurs because they are usually focused mainly on specific goals such as engineering, education and outreach. As such, other important aspects of managing an organization tend to be left behind. This is a problem because it generates a susceptible environment for conducts of discriminatory harassment of different types such as sexual, gender and sexual orientation-based harassment. However, the importance of these kinds of policies and bylaws is often overlooked by independent organizations. The biggest reason being that nowadays, almost every organization, university and company has a harassment policy. Most of the current undergraduate students have never been part of an organization that lacks these relevant policies and therefore cannot foresee the problems that come with their inexistence. This paper will document the case of TECSpace, an independent aerospace engineering student group from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR) where it was found that about 10% of the organization's members had experienced gender discrimination. To address this problem a methodology was developed by TECSpace members, psychologists and lawyers from the Gender Equality Office of the ITCR. This methodology was thought to be replicable with the objective that other independent organizations that do not have resources, such as gender equality offices or expert's support, can create their own harassment policies. This methodology is open and democratic, meaning that it involves most, if not all, members of the organization through focus groups. It consists of several steps which include existing policy revision, definition of the organizing team, characterization of the organization's community, focus groups consultancy, data systematization, policy definition, results divulgation and incorporation of the policy to the organization. These steps will be explained in detail with guides and templates to facilitate their application. This methodology is the first developed specifically for independent aerospace student groups. In Latin America, TECSpace is the only group of this nature that has a harassment policy and bylaws. The implementation of these policies allows for better and more efficient organizational culture, working environments and promotes diversity in the aerospace sector, which translates to better results for the organization's main objectives whether they are engineering, education or outreach. © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Investigating Knowledge Translation Dynamics for a Multi-Agency Response to Gender-Based Abuse,"Donnellan, Claudine; Corcoran, Niall; Cannon, Matthew","Domestic, sexual, and gender-based abuse (DSGBA) is a complex societal issue with implications for individuals, families, and communities. According to the World Health Organisation, violence remains a pervasive problem, affecting one in three women globally. Addressing this complex issue requires the coordinated efforts of all agencies involved in the intervention and prevention of DSGBA. Despite shared goals, these agencies predominantly operate independently, resulting in the development of their own knowledge bases. Recognising the negative implications of agencies developing isolated knowledge bases for service users and society, this Action Research study adopts an integrated knowledge translation approach to investigate the knowledge production and transfer processes among multi-agency practitioners and academics engaged in the DSGBA field. The study introduces a virtual community of practice (vCoP) as a dynamic knowledge management system, aiming to evaluate its effectiveness in facilitating knowledge translation and bridging the research-to-practice gap. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative and qualitative measures to explore knowledge transfer dynamics. Surveys, focus groups, interviews, user metrics, and content analysis provide a comprehensive understanding of community participation and interaction within a vCoP. Beyond traditional analysis methods, this study incorporates natural language processing techniques to uncover patterns, themes, and sentiments, facilitating the knowledge translation process. By extracting and translating insights from the vCoP discussion forums, the research aims to produce actionable resources such as best practices, academic papers, and policy guidelines, bridging the research-to-practice gap. The study aims to contribute a framework for implementing multi-agency vCoP, offering insights that could be adapted and applied in similar contexts. In addition, it seeks to address knowledge production and translation issues by fostering improved collaboration between academia and practitioners. The enhanced understanding of knowledge transfer dynamics within the DSGBA vCoP has the potential to influence positive change in decision-making processes and best practices, leading to more effective interventions and services combatting DSGBA. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

The Gender Gap in STEM and Computer Science Jobs: A Study Investigating Job Abandonment Rates of Women in Computer Science,"Stevenson, Monica L.","The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative research study was to investigate the experiences of women in the field of computer science to gain a better understanding of the obstacles that prevent them from enjoying lengthy successful careers in the field. This research study sample represented 10 women from various parts of the country holding many titles but sharing the common denominator of working in the field of computer science. Women participating in this study provided valuable insight into the challenges that many women face within the field of computer science and STEM as a whole. Atkinson’s Expectancy Value Theory (EVT) served as the theoretical basis for this study. Data was gathered by way of personal interviews that were conducted by phone. As a result of these interviews five major themes were developed: (a) Role models, (b) Mentoring, (c) Training opportunities, (d) Lack of support, and (e) Sexual harassment. Mentoring was suggested as a recommendation for practice. Recommendations for future research included (a) an ethnographic study following girls and women over a progressive period of time to better understand how developmental experiences impact decisions to pursue STEM fields, (b) a qualitative study to explore schools and universities who have achieved success in STEM programs for girls and women to understand the nuances involved in creating diverse programs, and (c) a qualitative study involving the families of successful women in STEM to better understand their perceptions and the roles they played in providing support.

In this qualitative evidence synthesis, our aim is to understand social and structural barriers and how they hinder MSM’s and TGW’s access to HIV testing services in sub-Saharan African countries. We searched four selective databases (PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL complemented with Google Scholar) for qualitative studies, published in English between January 2005 and December 2023, generated 1507 articles, of which 22 were included. Thematic synthesis was conducted for data synthesis. This led to five barriers that hinder HIV test uptake among MSM and TGW, which included: non-availability of tailored HIV testing services, stigma, lack of trust among service providers, sexual and physical violence, and criminalization of same sex relationship. To navigate these social and structural barriers and cope with fears of discrimination and criminalization, MSM and TGW engaged into riskier behaviors, including avoiding HIV testing, non-disclosure, or relying on informal or alternative sources of HIV testing. Decriminalization of same-sex relationship and peer-led HIV testing services were noted to address structural barriers, including stigma and poor access, and subsequently increase the participation in HIV testing services.",2025,,Journal of Homosexuality,72,2,245-271,3145989254,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2024.2320237,,#784,Thapa 2025,"",""
"“It’s a joke, not a dick. So don’t take it too hard”: online sexual harassment in Indian universities","Dey, Adrija","Recently, while there has been some attention to the issues online harassment in higher education, the impacts of online sexual harassment have been lost within the broader focus. There is negligible research looking at these specific experiences within Indian universities. To address this gap, this paper explores three different but interconnected forms of online sexual harassment—image-based sexual abuse, online chat rooms, and trolling in the context of Indian universities. Following the works of Liz Kelly (1987) and Clare McGlynn, Erika Rackley and Ruth Houghton (2017), this paper establishes the importance of understanding online sexual harassment as a continuum of other forms of offline sexual violence having physical, mental, and financial impacts on survivors, deeply affecting their sense of safety. In doing so, this paper attempts to develop a materialist understanding of online sexual harassment in Indian universities in turn demonstrating the confluence of India’s patriarchal and casteist society and an authoritarian state who use technology as a powerful disciplining tool to push women and queer people out of digital public spaces. This research attempts to establish that this disciplining and silencing of women and queer people are essential for the spread of both techno-capitalism and Brahmanical Hindutva nationalism.",2024,,Feminist Media Studies,24,8,1830-1846,3131666291,https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2023.2266150,,#785,Dey 2024,"",""
“Finding My Worth as a Sexual Being”: A Qualitative Gender Analysis of Sexual Self-Concept and Coping in Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse,"Guyon, Roxanne; Fernet, Mylène; Couture, Stéphanie; Tardif, Monique; Cousineau, Marie-Marthe; Godbout, Natacha","Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is likely to have impacts on adult survivors’ sexuality, particularly on their sexual self-concept. However, little is known about how survivors cope with CSA-related sexual impacts, including sexual self-concept impairments. Thus, this study aimed to examine the interplay between sexual self-concept and coping strategies in CSA survivors by (1) documenting the manifestations of their impaired sexual self-concepts; (2) identifying their strategies to cope with the sexual impacts of CSA; and (3) examining gender differences on sexual self-concept impairments and coping strategies. Content analysis was conducted on semi-structured interviews with 25 women and 26 men adult survivors of CSA recruited via social networks and victim support organizations. Analyses yielded three conceptual categories: (1) Developing an unconsolidated and unfavorable sexual self-concept following CSA; (2) Avoiding CSA-related sexual impacts and impaired sexual self-concept; (3) Approaching CSA-related sexual impacts with more authenticity. Men often managed their suffering and compensated for their impaired sexual self-concept by engaging in sexual dominance and over-investment, by accepting their sexual difficulties and relying on medication to overcome them. Women tended to restrict themselves and disconnect sexually to avoid suffering, complied with their partners’ sexual demands out of a sense of duty, prioritized sexual intimacy over orgasm, and seek professional help. Interventions with survivors should promote the development of approach strategies to cope with sexual difficulties, including self-concept impairments, and foster sexual authenticity.",2024,,Archives of Sexual Behavior,53,1,341-357,2915808411,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-023-02693-5,,#788,Guyon 2024,"",""
Sexual Harassment and Assault in Public Spaces: Individual Vulnerability and Contextual Risk Factors,"Peterson, Zoë D.; Carver, Dasha N.; Klann, Elyssa M.; Gesselman, Amanda N.; Akers, Brianna M.; Garcia, Justin R.","Prior research has demonstrated that sexual harassment in public spaces is common; however, little is known about the contexts or types of harassment that occur in different public venues.

Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation through Livestreaming in Indonesia: Unequal Power Relations at the Root of Child Victimization,"Tanaya, Ni Luh Tasya Prathisthita; Puteri, Ni Made Martini","Child sexual abuse and exploitation through livestreaming is a rising phenomenon of online child sexual abuse and exploitation in Indonesia. This phenomenon takes place in both offline and online spaces. Moreover, due to the active involvement of the viewers, these content viewers can also be considered as offenders. Thus, it is necessary to recognize this phenomenon as a crime against children, instead of merely a sexual act. By using a criminology perspective, this research explores the roots of this phenomenon, the impact on survivors, and the child protection system's actions against it. This qualitative study used secondary data analysis, derived from a total of nineteen Indonesian news articles as well as five cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse through livestreaming. Power relations theory by Michel Foucault is used to explain the power relations and victimization in this phenomenon. The analysis shows that unequal power relations between adults and children contribute to the phenomenon. The unequal power relations include how societies perceive children, victim-blaming, gender inequality, and the existing situation of the porn industry, which places the children in vulnerable positions. The child survivors in these case studies were found to experience multiple victimizations, including sexual abuse in real life and online in conjunction with economic victimization. These victimization processes are prolonged due to the fact that sexual content is rapidly shared by the offenders; thus, the situation can be described as chronic revictimization. Indonesian systems for protecting children against such crimes were found to be inefficient due to the absence of legal terminology to define child sexual abuse and exploitation through livestreaming and the lack of laws that can be used to punish the viewers.",2023,,Journal of International Women's Studies,25,3,1-14,2819704403,,,#790,Tanaya 2023,"",""
"Who Is to Blame? African Feminism, Human Rights, and Sexual Violence against Izintombi (Virgins) in South Africa","Ntuli, Goodness Thandi","This article highlights the intensifying prevalence of sexual violence in South Africa, which affects women including izintombi (virgins, also known as Zulu maidens). Ubuntombi (virginity) traditionally represented a typical identity marker of young-womanhood in the indigenous lives of Zulus. As an aftermath of colonialism and imperialism, the cultural importance of women's virginity faded into the past with only sporadic survival in some rural areas of South Africa. For some reasons, it was visibly revived together with virginity-testing as public events in the 1980s and 1990s. The practice of virginity-testing was criticized by some scholars, human rights and gender activists, who blamed it for promoting rape of the young women involved. The blame became an undeniably common phenomenon in the early 1990s due to the myth that having sex with a virgin cured HIV infection. However, this empirical study conducted in KwaZulu-Natal through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions found that izintombi (virgins) refuted the claim. Virgins felt that the 1990s myth could not still be the cause of sexual violence against them since South Africans received education concerning that myth. This study used a postcolonial feminist theoretical lens because the group under study were young women from a formerly colonized Zulu ethnic group. Controversies that surrounded the revival of ubuntombi (virginity) accompanied by virginity testing did not deter its rapid embrace by a number of contemporary izintombi (virgins) as their indigenous cultural practice, heritage, and identity. It is in the practice of this intended choice that izintombi face persistent threats of sexual violence against them. This is regardless of the guaranteed South African constitutional rights to equality and security stipulated in the Bill of Rights. Thus, this article also raises the question of who is to blame for the ubiquity of this violence and how it could be addressed without blaming the sufferers. It further underscores the need for intensified activism by African feminists, human rights activists, and gender activists against the pervasiveness of sexual violence that haunts izintombi.",2023,,Journal of International Women's Studies,25,3,1-13,2819696625,,,#791,Ntuli 2023,"",""

Lifetime sexual violence exposure in women compromises systemic innate immune mediators associated with HIV pathogenesis: A cross-sectional analysis,"Daniels, Jason; Aldous, Annette; Pyra, Maria; Yu, Xia; Juzumaite Monika; Jais Mariel; Simmens, Samuel; Murphy, Kerry; Taylor, Tonya N; Kassaye Seble; Benning Lorie; Cohen, Mardge H; Weber, Kathleen M; Ghosh, Mimi","Objectives:  Violence and HIV/AIDS syndemic highly prevalent among women impairs HIV prevention efforts. Prolonged exposure to violence results in physical trauma and psychological distress. Building on previous findings regarding genital immune dysregulation following sexual abuse exposure, we investigate here whether systemic changes occur as well.  Methods:  Using the Women’s Interagency HIV Study repository, 77 women were stratified by HIV serostatus and categorized into four subgroups: (1) no sexual abuse history and lower depression score (Control); (2) no sexual abuse history but higher depression score (Depression); (3) high sexual abuse exposure and lower depression score (Abuse); (4) high sexual abuse exposure and higher depression score (Abuse + Depression). Inflammation-associated immune biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, TGF-β, MIP-3α, IP-10, MCP-1, and Cathepsin-B) and anti-inflammatory/anti-HIV biomarkers (Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, Elafin, human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2), alpha-defensins 1-3, Thrombospondin, Serpin-A1, and Cystatin-C) were measured in plasma using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Within each HIV serostatus, differences in biomarker levels between subgroups were evaluated with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction. Spearman correlations between biomarkers were assessed for each subgroup.  Results:  Compared to the Control and Depression groups, Abuse + Depression was associated with significantly higher levels of chemokines MIP-3α and IP-10 (p < 0.01) and lower levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (p < 0.01) in the HIV-uninfected population. Human beta-defensin-2 was lowest in the Abuse + Depression group (p < 0.05 versus Depression). By contrast, among HIV-infected, Abuse and Abuse + Depression were associated with lower levels of MIP-3α (p < 0.05 versus Control) and IP-10 (p < 0.05, Abuse versus Control). Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was higher in both Abuse groups (p < 0.05 versus Control), while Elafin was lowest in the Abuse + Depression group (p < 0.01 versus Depression).

Neural correlates of cognitive control in women with a history of sexual violence suggest altered prefrontal cortical activity during cognitive processing,"Sinko, Laura; Regier, Paul; Curtin, Adrian; Ayaz Hasan; Childress, Rose, Anna; Teitelman, Anne M","Objective:  Women’s experiences of sexual violence can be not only psychologically and physically traumatizing but may also have lasting effects on brain functions, including cognitive control relating to the inhibition and processing of emotion. Thus, the purpose of this pilot study is to explore underlying neural correlates of sexual violence’s impact on cognitive control in women.  Methods:  Thirty women (aged 21–30 years) participants underwent a quantitative survey along with an affect-congruent Go-NoGo task. Prefrontal activity was monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, a portable neuroimaging technology. An analysis of variance tested for main effects of the condition (Go versus NoGo), group (sexual violence versus no prior sexual violence), and potential interactions.  Results:  Fifteen of 30 women reported a history of childhood (n = 5) and/or adult (n = 12) sexual violence. Those with sexual violence histories reported significantly higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, as well as increased impulsivity compared to their peers. Behavioral performance did not differ between the groups; however, functional near-infrared spectroscopy data revealed a significant (group × condition) interaction in Optodes 13 and 16. Women with histories of sexual violence had a significantly lower response during the “NoGo” condition and a heightened response during the “Go” condition, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Conclusion:  These results suggest altered prefrontal cortical activity during cognitive processing in women with a history of sexual violence, showing hypoactivity during response inhibition and hyperactivity to the positive stimuli.

"The #MeToo Movement, Sexual Violence, and the Law in Sweden","Carroll, Caitlin P","In the fall of 2017, the international #MeToo movement engulfed Sweden, a country known for its progressive politics and institutionalized commitment to gender equality. As in many other countries, women publicly disclosed experiences of sexual harassment and violence. The mass disclosures of sexual violence were seen as a ""shame"" for Swedish society, a country that has shaped an international image as a country committed to gender equality (TV4Nyheterna 2017; see also Martinsson et al. 2016). The #MeToo movement challenged the dominant perception of Swedish gender exceptionalism and clearly illuminated that ""yes, it happens in Sweden, #too"" (Nordberg 2017).I will analyze how the #MeToo movement unfolded in Sweden, particularly how the movement illuminated the paradox between gender equality and the continued vulnerability and sexual victimization of women. The high number of sexual violence incidents unearthed during the #MeToo movement in Sweden was framed as a stark contrast to the international image of Sweden (and its Nordic neighbors) as a ""gender-equal utopia"" (Fiig 2008). While a positive and active response to the movement from the government reveals the power of feminist activism in Sweden to influence legislating and policymaking, the use of defamation law against women who named individual offenders literally and symbolically silences survivors of sexual violence. The criticism directed towards anti-violence feminist activist movements like #MeToo—especially these legal consequences of speaking out against individual perpetrators—highlights a tension in Sweden between feminist activism and the law. I argue that the #MeToo movement and its aftermath in Sweden reveals how collective action against sexual violence can overcome strong resistance to feminist legal and social change, but fundamental barriers to speaking out against sexual violence remain.The data in this article come from forty-eight in-depth interviews I conducted with feminist anti-violence activists and rape crisis advocates, criminal justice professionals, political elites, and state bureaucrats during fifteen months of fieldwork from 2017–2019, in addition to a discourse analysis of parliamentary documents and news media sources focused on the #MeToo movement and political debates around sexual violence and the law.

Prevalence and Correlates of Sexual Violence Experienced by Young Adult Black Men Who Have Sex with Men,"Siconolfi, Daniel; Storholm, Erik D; Wilson, Vincent; Pollack, Lance; Rebchook Gregory M; Huebner, David M; Peterson, John L; Kegeles, Susan M","Men who have sex with men (MSM) experience high prevalence of sexual violence (SV), and SV has well-documented effects on health. Research gaps are especially evident for young Black MSM (YBMSM), who experience significant HIV disparities and syndemics, including multiple forms of violence victimization. We examined lifetime prevalence of SV (having been forced or frightened into sexual activity) in a cross-sectional sample of YBMSM (N = 1732), and tested associations of demographic, psychosocial, and structural factors using multivariable regression. YBMSM were recruited between 2013 and 2015 using modified venue-based time-location sampling (e.g., at bars and clubs) in Dallas and Houston, Texas. Approximately 17% of YBMSM experienced any SV in their lifetimes. SV was associated with high school non-completion (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.15–2.77), lower psychological resilience (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71–0.98), lifetime history of homelessness (OR 5.52; 95% CI 3.80–8.02), recent financial hardship (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.48–3.14), and recent transactional sex (OR 3.87; 95% CI 2.43–6.15). We also examined differences by age of SV onset (childhood versus adulthood). YBMSM with adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV may have been more ambivalent in reporting lifetime SV experience, compared to men with childhood-onset SV, and correlates differed by age of onset. Childhood-onset SV was associated with high school non-completion, lower levels of psychological resilience, history of homelessness, recent financial hardship, and recent transactional sex. Adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV was associated with greater depressive symptoms, history of homelessness, and recent financial hardship.

However, little is known about psychiatric and substance use disparities between gay and bisexual men who have experienced CSA. We recruited a purposive convenience sample in Boston and Miami, involving self-report and clinical interview data from 290 sexual minority men (M age = 38.0 years) who reported CSA, defined as unwanted sexual contact before 13 years of age with an adult or person five years older, or unwanted sexual contact between 13 and 16 years of age with a person 10 years older (or any age with the threat of force or harm). We compared those who self-identified as gay (n = 199) versus bisexual (n = 64) on demographic and structural variables (i.e., government benefits, unstable housing, and neighborhood crime) as well as psychiatric and substance use diagnoses. Across 15 unique diagnoses, three were more common in bisexual men than gay men in unadjusted models: bipolar disorder (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.01–8.34), obsessive compulsive disorder (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.01–4.88), and alcohol use disorder (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.03–3.38). Bisexual men were also more likely to meet criteria for “any substance use disorder” than were gay men (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.10–3.59).

SVSH research rarely focuses on graduate students, who occupy unique positions within university settings due to their multiple responsibilities (e.g., teaching, research, mentoring), including managing unequal power dynamics with mentors and advisors. As part of a larger qualitative study, we sought to better understand SVSH generally and, when applicable, experiences of SVSH among graduate students on three campuses. Our primary research questions were: (a) How graduate students understand SVSH on their campus and whether they are at risk, (b) How graduate students navigate power dynamics that position them to experience SVSH, and (c) What graduate student-centered solutions and improvements can make campuses safer, more equitable spaces for all students. To answer these questions, we conducted 21 in-depth interviews and 8 focus group discussions with a diverse group of graduate students across various graduate programs. Using grounded theory and implementing student-centered approaches to data collection and analysis, we identified multiple themes, including graduate students’ uncertainty regarding SVSH on campus; and how power relations with faculty, combined with distrust of university processes, keep many graduate students silent about SVSH.

Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment-Social Barricades and Implementation of Laws in Pakistan,"Deeba, Malieka Farah","Sexual harassment infringes the fundamental human rights of women. It restricts the most important segment of society from demonstrating their full potential and their right to work and attain equal opportunity. The quantum of this behaviour in a society can only be evaluated when women in general are fully aware of the nature of this behaviour and the legal protection available. Sexual harassment is an ambiguous term for many; when hearing of an incident of sexual harassment, many might not understand exactly what crime has been committed. Under which category does it fall? What if the complainant is lying? Pakistan has enacted special and general laws to fight the epidemic of sexual harassment. This article presents the appraisal and implementation of all the prevailing laws related to sexual harassment of women in Pakistan. It examines the hurdles, restraints, and resistance women have faced during the course of adjudication and determination of such matters due to various factors including social barricades that persist in this society. This qualitative and quantitative study examined whether the prevailing laws sufficiently cover the full nature, scope, and underlying themes of sexual harassment through implementation, by analyzing the procedures adopted at the time of implementations. I also explored whether sexual harassment is really a form of discrimination and what prevailing laws should entail to combat the practice and whether the law is generally accepted by the social community because of certain intrinsic differences.

To evaluate univariate analysis between sexual violence and physical violence as dependent variables and the assumed exposures as well as confounders, the models were built distinctly. The models included exposures of the questionnaire as independent variables. The exposure factors with a p value of less than 0.2 were moved into the multiple logistic regression models. The rates of sexual violence and physical violence were reported as 72.2% and 82.3% respectively.

Non-Consensual Sexual Contact at Electronic Dance Music Parties,"Palamar, Joseph J; Griffin Marybec","Non-consensual sexual contact in bars is common, but few studies have focused on the extent of this problem at electronic dance music (EDM) parties, which are growing in popularity. We aimed to estimate prevalence and correlates of non-consensual sexual contact among individuals who attend EDM parties in New York City (NYC). Adults (ages 18–40 years) entering EDM parties in NYC were surveyed in 2018 using time–space sampling. Participants (n = 1005) were asked whether they had experienced unwanted or uninvited sexual contact including unwanted groping, kissing, or touching at an EDM party. We estimate that 15.2% of EDM party attendees in NYC have experienced non-consensual sexual contact at such parties. The majority (62.5%) of those reported that it occurred 1–2 times and 49.1% were usually or always drunk or high during the encounter(s).

The findings show that negative comments depict rape as a sexual act against the victim’s will, whereas positive comments portray rape as sexual acts without the victim’s consent. Additionally, negative comments addressed expectation regarding “real men” and “real rape,” whereas positive comments emphasized gender equality in rape comprehension and victim treatment. Our discussion addresses the findings within the context of traditional gender roles and perceptions of “real” rape and presents implications for education and training.

What Money Can’t Buy: Different Patterns in Decision Making About Sex and Money Predict Past Sexual Coercion Perpetration,"Fannie Carrier Emond; Gagnon, Jean; Nolet, Kevin; Cyr, Gaëlle; Rouleau, Joanne-Lucine","Self-reported impulsivity has been found to predict the perpetration of sexual coercion in both sexual offenders and male college students. Impulsivity can be conceptualized as a generalized lack of self-control (i.e., general perspective) or as a multifaceted construct that can vary from one context to the other (i.e., domain-specific perspective). Delay discounting, the tendency to prefer sooner smaller rewards over larger delayed rewards, is a measure of impulsive decision making. Recent sexual adaptations of delay discounting tasks can be used to test domain-specific assumptions. The present study used the UPPS-P impulsivity questionnaire, a standard money discounting task, and a sexual discounting task to predict past use of sexual coercion in a sample of 98 male college students. Results indicated that higher negative urgency scores, less impulsive money discounting, and more impulsive sexual discounting all predicted sexual coercion. Consistent with previous studies, sexuality was discounted more steeply than money by both perpetrators and non-perpetrators of sexual coercion, but this difference was twice as large in perpetrators compared to non-perpetrators. Our study identified three different predictors of sexual coercion in male college students: a broad tendency to act rashly under negative emotions, a specific difficulty to postpone sexual gratification, and a pattern of optimal non-sexual decision making.

"Secondary Victimization of Sexual Minority Men Following Disclosure of Sexual Assault: ""Victimizing Me All Over Again...""","Jackson, Michelle A; Valentine, Sarah E; Woodward, Eva N; Pantalone, David W","The estimated prevalence of adult sexual assault among sexual minority men (SMM) is comparable to published estimates for women. Adult sexual assault is associated with low disclosure rates and poor physical and mental health in SMM. One potential negative consequence of disclosures is secondary victimization, whereby victims perceive disclosure recipients' reactions as victim-blaming or discriminatory and, therefore, retraumatizing. The published literature on secondary victimization among SMM is limited to the reporting of hate crimes and has not been extended to adult sexual assault, despite its high prevalence among SMM. Here, we explored the adult sexual assault disclosure experiences of 18 SMM through qualitative interviews (M age=42.4 years). We observed four themes: (1) secondary victimization behaviors by disclosure recipients; (2) the role of sexual orientation in disclosure experiences; (3) participants' own emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to secondary victimization; and (4) participants' perceptions about how disclosure influenced their long-term recovery process from adult sexual assault. Secondary victimization behaviors included dismissal, blaming, and attributing sexual assault to alcohol use or sexual orientation.

"Dangerous Spaces: Kenya's Public Universities as a Locus for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence – A Case Study of Egerton University, Njoro Campus","Wane, Njoki Nathani; Parsitau, Damaris Seleina; Nyokangi, Doris","According to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination ofViolence Against Women, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993, Gender Based Violence is defined as ""any act that is likely to result in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to an individual because of his/her gender, including threats, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in the public or private life.""According to the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), GBV is rooted in prescribed behaviors, norms, and attitudes based on gender and sexuality.[...]as an Institute, in 2015-2016, we handled weekly reports of case of GBV involving both male and female students, although females report more cases of GBV than males.According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, 15 percent ofadolescent girls who have had sexual intercourse have done so in exchange for money, gifts, or favours in the twelve months leading up to the survey (KNBS).",2017,,"Canadian Woman Studies, suppl.

"Studying Sexual and Gendered Violence Prevention in Higher Education: Local/Vertical, Global/Horizontal, and Power-Based Frames","Todorova, Miglena S","Instead of serving as a ""campus,"" these spaces signify social, political, and even sexual violence and danger that students do not experience within the university itself.[...]by asking about sexual violence on ""campus,"" we were imposing foreign epistemologies attached to hegemonic political and cultural power.[...]the university has protected these structures from collapse or radical change by maintaining policies, practices, and curriculum that are largely supportive of these structures and the sexual and gendered violence they produce.[...]it took nearly half a century and a provincial government regulation, initiated by a queer and femocrat Canadian Prime Minister in 2014-2015, to push the 45 publicly-funded colleges and universities in Ontario to start collecting and reporting data on sexual and gendered violence, and to implement sexual violence policies and prevention programs (see Ministry of the Status of Women 2015).A technology of inclusion without redistribution of power, nor safety from violence, is illustrated further by the related phenomena of nation-states becoming signatories to international treaties committed to eliminating violence against women in their societies.Since 1980, 185 states have signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; many states have since 1993 also supported the related UN Declaration to End Violence Against Women.",2017,,"Canadian Woman Studies, suppl.

Physical Appearance and Sexual Activity Mediate the Link Between Early Puberty and Sexual Harassment Victimization in Male Adolescents,"Skoog, Therése; Bayram Özdemir, Sevgi","Contrary to common belief, research shows that male adolescents are frequent targets of sexual harassment. According to some prior studies, early puberty puts male adolescents at a particular risk for being sexually harassed. In this cross-sectional study, we tested two competing explanations of the link between male pubertal timing and sexual harassment in early adolescence. The explanations were based on evolutionary and feminist theories. The sample included 704 seventh-grade Swedish male adolescents (M age=13.37, SD=.59). We found that looking more mature and being sexually active significantly mediated the link between pubertal timing and sexual harassment. The magnitude of the indirect effects did not differ significantly from each other. These findings largely replicate prior research for female adolescents, and they suggest that early pubertal timing is linked to victimizing sexual phenomena in early adolescence through young men's normative sexually mature appearance and sexual activities. Tolerance and respect for differences should be central components of interventions aimed at reducing sexual harassment among young people of any gender.",2016,,Sex Roles,75,7-8,339-348,1819311770,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0619-9,,#818,Skoog 2016,"",""
"Verbal, Physical and Sexual Abuse Status Against Operating Room Nurses in Turkey","Tekin, Yasemin Eda; Bulut, Hulya","This descriptive study investigated the verbal, physical and sexual abuse status against operating room nurses. Health care professionals work in stressful environments with managerial problems and abuse. This can negatively affect patient care, the institution and the health care system. Of the 575 nurses that work in the 32 hospitals where approval was granted from the Ministry of Health, 380 nurses consented to filling out the questionnaires and thus composed the sample for this study. The data obtained from this study was evaluated with the SPSS 15.0 program. Descriptive statistics were given as number, percentage, mean and standard deviation. The comparison of categorical data was done by the Khi-square test, and the comparison of continuous variables was done with the T Test. According to the data obtained from our study, the percentages of verbal, physical and sexual abuse were 84.5, 25.5 and 32.6 % respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the origin of all types of abuse was the physicians. Abused nurses stated that the abuse they were exposed to affected their relationship with that person, decreased their work performance and lead to thoughts of quiting nursing. Verbally abused nurses expressed that they solved the problem by talking with the person about their behavior and the physically abused expressed that they reported the event to the people of authority. Sexually abused victims reported that they tried to solve the problem by pretending it never happened. The most common physical disorders that abused nurses experienced were headache, fatigue, insomnia and stomach pain. While nurses who had the least years of experience were exposed to verbal abuse, nurses who had more experience were exposed to physical abuse. Also in our study, women were found to be most commonly exposed to verbal and sexual abuse, whereas men were commonly exposed to physical abuse. Recommendations were made based on the results of this research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2014,,Sexuality and Disability,32,1,85-97,1500659949,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11195-014-9339-7,,#819,Tekin 2014,"",""
