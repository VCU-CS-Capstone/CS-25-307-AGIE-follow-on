Gender Differences in Work-Life Integration Among Medical Physicists.,Paradis KC; Ryan KA; Schmid S; Moran JM; Laucis AM; Chapman CH; Bott-Kothari T; Prisciandaro JI; Simiele SJ; Balter JM; Matuszak MM; Narayana V; Jagsi R,"PURPOSE: To generate an understanding of the primary concerns facing medical physicists regarding integration of a demanding technical career with their personal lives. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 2019, we recruited 32 medical physics residents, faculty, and staff via emails to US medical physics residency program directors to participate in a 1-hour, semistructured interview that elicited their thoughts on several topics, including work-life integration. Standard techniques of qualitative thematic analysis were used to generate the research findings. RESULTS: Of the participants, 50% were women and 69% were non-Hispanic White individuals, with a mean (SD) age of 37.5 (7.4) years. They were evenly split between residents and faculty or staff. Participant responses centered around 5 primary themes: the gendered distribution of household responsibilities, the effect of career or work on home and family life, the effect of family on career or work, support and strategies for reconciling work-life conflicts, and the role of professional societies in addressing work-life integration. Participants expressed concern about the effect of heavy workloads on home life, with female respondents more likely to report carrying the majority of the household burden. CONCLUSIONS: Medical physicists experience challenges in managing work-life conflict amid a diverse array of personal and professional responsibilities. Further investigations are needed to quantitatively assess the division of work and household labor by gender in medical physics, particularly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this study's qualitative findings suggest that the profession should consider ways to address root causes of work-life conflict to promote the future success and well-being of all medical physicists, and perhaps women in particular.",2021,Sep-Oct,Adv Radiat Oncol,6,5,100724,,10.1016/j.adro.2021.100724,34278052,#5,Paradis 2021,"",""

Strategies for Achieving Gender Equity and Work-Life Integration in Physician-Scientist Training.,Ghosh-Choudhary S; Carleton N; Flynn JL; Kliment CR,"Substantial gender inequities persist across academic medicine. These issues are not new: Recent evidence still points to a chilly climate for women in academic medicine, including those in physician-scientist training. The discussion for how to address gender equity and issues of work-life integration typically centers around faculty and rarely includes trainees. The authors delineate specific strategies to address gender inequity in physician-scientist training by identifying key stakeholders for implementation and proposing areas to integrate these strategies with current training timelines. Strategies discussed include multiple-role mentoring, allyship training for trainees and faculty, early implementation of professional development sessions, incorporation of childcare and family-friendly policies, and additional policies for funding bodies to prioritize gender equity practices. The goal of this article is to equip trainees and the academic community with proactive strategies to create a more equitable environment for future generations of trainees in academic medicine.",2022,Apr,Acad Med,97,4,492-496,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000004246,34292189,#8,Ghosh-Choudhary 2022,"",""
"Gender Differences in Compensation, Mentorship, and Work-Life Balance within Facial Plastic Surgery.",Lafer MP; Frants A; Zhang Y; Wang B; Lee JW,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to identify gender differences in work-life balance, professional advancement, workload, salary, and career satisfaction among facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Survey. METHODS: American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) members were invited by email to respond to a confidential 25-question online survey. The survey had a response rate of 12%. There were a total of 139 participants; 23 participants were in training and 116 were either board-eligible or board-certified facial plastic surgeons. Collected variables included general demographics, personal life, academic involvement, career development, workload, and career satisfaction. RESULTS: Forty percent of participants were female. Fifty-nine percent of female participants were 25-35 years old compared with 15% of male participants. The majority of male participants were over 45 years old (63%) while only 19% of female participants fell into this age category (P < .0001). Women were more likely to be in a relationship with a physician (35% vs. 19%) or non-physician full-time professional (55% vs. 31%). The vast majority of men had children (89%) while only half of women (52%) had children. On average, women with children had fewer children than men (P < .0001). No gender difference was seen with respect to working full versus part-time (P = .81). Participants were equally satisfied with a surgical career regardless of gender. CONCLUSION: Although significant progress has already been made towards closing the gender gap, gender disparities remain both professionally and personally for facial plastic surgeons. With an increasing number of women in medicine, we should continue to strive to close the gender gap.

Race and Gender Disparities Among Leadership in Academic Family Medicine.,Adetoye M; Gold K,"As the United States moves closer to a majority-minority, and a nearly equal male to female population, we should see a similar shift in the composition of leadership in the workplace. Family Medicine, while attempting to close the gaps, continues to fall short in producing women and minority leaders. METHODS: The demographic traits of Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM) chairs in medical education institutions in the United States and Canada were analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of those in chair positions were male (67%) and White (53%) non-Hispanic. Male chairs have been in positions significantly longer than females (average 9 years and 6 years, respectively). There was also a significant difference between chairs in public versus private schools-public, that is, chairs at public institutions had a much longer average time of 9 years in current position compared with those in private institutions had an average of 5 years. While the comparison was not significant, 46% of those that self-reported as non-White held chair positions at private schools compared with 28% of those that self-reported as White. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of leadership pathways, women and underrepresented minorities continue to be underrepresented in these positions. Future research would benefit from a more extensive evaluation of different characteristics such as disability, gender identity and sexual orientation.",2022,Sep,J Am Board Fam Med,,,,,10.3122/jabfm.2022.AP.220122,36096662,#10,Adetoye 2022,"",""
The Gender Wage Gap Among Early-Career Family Physicians.,Sanders K; Jabbarpour Y; Phillips J; Fleischer S; Peterson LE,"PURPOSE: Numerous studies have documented salary differences between male and female physicians. For many specialties, this wage gap has been explored by controlling for measurable factors that influence pay such as productivity, work-life balance, and practice patterns. In family medicine where practice activities differ widely between physicians, it is important to understand what measurable factors may be contributing to the gender wage gap, so that employers and policymakers and can address unjust disparities. METHODS: We used data from the 2017 to 2020 American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) National Graduate Survey (NGS) which is administered to family physicians 3 years after residency (n = 8608; response rate = 63.9%, 56.2% female). The survey collects clinical income and practice patterns. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed, which included variables on hours worked, degree type, principal professional activity, rural/urban, and region. RESULTS: Although early-career family physician incomes averaged $225,278, female respondents reported incomes that were $43,566 (17%) lower than those of male respondents (P = .001). Generally, female respondents tended toward lower-earning principal professional activities and US regions; worked fewer hours (2.9 per week); and tended to work more frequently in urban settings. However, in adjusted models, this gap in income only fell to $31,804 (13% lower than male respondents, P = .001). CONCLUSION: Even after controlling for measurable factors such as hours worked, degree type, principal professional activity, population density, and region, a significant wage gap persists. Interventions should be taken to eliminate gender bias in wage determinations for family physicians.",2024,Mar-Apr,J Am Board Fam Med,37,2,270-278,,10.3122/jabfm.2023.230218R1,38740481,#11,Sanders 2024,"",""
Gender and early-career faculty disparities in hematology and oncology board review lecture series.,Syaj S; Al-Kraimeen L; Akhdar M; Abushukair H; Mohty R; Al Hadidi S,"Participation of women and early-career faculty in hematology and medical oncology board review lecture series has not been studied previously. We aimed to evaluate gender and early-career faculty disparities in hematology and medical oncology board review lecture series.

Data about the lecture topic, field, speaker's gender, years of experience, and the frequency at which the lecture was given by the speaker were collected. Of 386 speakers participating, 315 (81.6%) were ABIM (American Board of Internal Medicine)-certified. A total of 1,224 board review lectures were given in the studied period, of which 1,016 (83%) were given by an ABIM-certified speaker. Women constituted 37.7% of all speakers, with less than 50% representation in five out of six courses. Lectures discussing malignant hematology topics had the lowest proportion of women presenters (24.8%), followed by solid tumors (38.9%) and benign hematology lectures (44.1%). Faculty with more than 15 years since initial certification presented more than 50% of lectures. The median time from initial hematology or medical oncology certification to lecture presentation was 12.5 years and 14 years, respectively.

Gender Disparities in End of Life Care: A Scoping Review.,Wong AD; Phillips SP,"Objective: Traditional gender norms and expectations may disproportionately constrain in-home palliative care received by women. This scoping review aims to canvass and evaluate the literature on gender disparities in end of life care and explore relevant themes that could inform future research and practice. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, OVID, COCHRANE, and EMBASE was conducted using MeSH terms palliative care, palliative medicine, terminal care, or hospice care, combined with gender equity, sex factors, sexism, or gender disparities. Articles were limited to those in English (2010 to 2021), focusing on end of life care, gender roles, patients, and caregivers. Results: Of 624 articles identified, 15 met inclusion criteria for critical appraisal using the AMSTAR checklist for systematic reviews and NICE guidelines for quantitative and qualitative studies. Most studies were of poor to moderate quality. Thematic analyses identified 6 major themes related to gender disparities: living situation, symptom experience, care context, care preferences, caregiving, and coping strategies.

"Gender Differences in Authorship of Family Medicine Publications, 2002-2017.",Keller T; Wilson M; Chung K; Andrilla CHA; Evans DV; Cawse-Lucas J,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Representation of women in medicine is increasing, including in academic family medicine. Despite this, women continue to hold a minority of senior faculty and leadership roles. This study examines the trends of women first and senior authorship between 2002 and 2017 in five family medicine journals: Family Medicine, Journal of Family Practice, Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, Annals of Family Medicine, and American Family Physician. The study also examines gender congruence between first and senior authors and women's membership on editorial boards. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data on a total of 1,671 original articles published in the five family medicine journals in 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. We also examined the gender composition of the journals' editorial boards. RESULTS: Overall, women first authorship increased significantly from 32.6% in 2002 to 47.7% in 2017. There was no significant difference in women senior authorship or editorial board representation from 2002 to 2017. Both men and women senior authors partnered with women first authors significantly more over the 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: While there was a statistically significant increase in women first authors between 2002 and 2017, there is still a gap between women's authorship and editorial board representation and their representation within academic family medicine.

Experiences of Gender Inequity Among Women Physicians Across Career Stages: Findings from Participant Focus Groups.,Chesak SS; Salinas M; Abraham H; Harris CE; Carey EC; Khalsa T; Mauck KF; Feely M; Licatino L; Moeschler S; Bhagra A,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gender inequity in academic medicine persists despite efforts to the contrary. Even with increasing representation of women physicians in academic medicine, leadership positions and promotion to tenure are still not representative. This study describes the experiences of women physicians at various stages of their careers, uncovering current challenges and potential areas for improvement toward gender equity. METHODS: Three focus groups were conducted (n = 28) as part of a national professional development conference: Growth, Resilience, Inspiration, and Tenacity (GRIT) for Women in Medicine: GRIT. We thematically analyzed participant responses to assess perspectives on the impact of experiences, barriers to professional growth, opportunities for improvement, and definitions of success. RESULTS: The major issues the participants faced included subthemes of (1) systemic barriers to success, (2) implicit biases, (3) self-advocacy, and (4) burnout and stress. Solutions for issues that were discussed included (1) fostering supportive communities, (2) encouraging personal and professional development, and (3) the need for system-wide policy changes.

Examining gender bias in the feedback shared with family medicine residents.,Loeppky C; Babenko O; Ross S,"OBJECTIVES: Competency-based education places increasing emphasis on formative feedback to learners as part of the assessment process. We wished to determine if gender bias was present in the feedback shared with post-graduate medical trainees (residents) in a two-year family medicine residency program at a Canadian university. METHODS: We performed secondary data analyses of documented feedback (FieldNotes) extracted from the Competency-Based Achievement System database. Between 2012 and 2016, 464 preceptors (188 female (F); 276 male (M)) wrote in total 7316 FieldNotes for 192 residents (104 F; 88 M), forming four gender dyads. Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends in FieldNotes frequencies, competencies (Sentinel Habits; SH), progress levels (PL), and the use of adjectives (agentic/competency-based; communal/warmth-based) by preceptors in the FieldNotes. RESULTS: Male and female preceptors wrote on average 7 and 14 FieldNotes, respectively. Female residents received on average more feedback comments from female preceptors (7 notes) than from male preceptors (4 notes). The M-M and M-F resident-preceptor dyads had, respectively, the least and the most 'Stop, Important correction' FieldNotes in both the PGY1 and PGY2 groups. Although preceptors used agentic adjectives more frequently than communal adjectives overall, the F-M resident-preceptor dyad contained the highest proportion of communal adjectives and the lowest proportion of agentic adjectives. CONCLUSIONS: Residents would benefit from multiple opportunities for feedback from both male and female preceptors throughout their residency training.

Sexual Harassment and Gender Bias in Family Medicine: Divergent Experiences of Men and Women.,Sanders M; Fogarty CT; Russell HA; Fiscella K; Nofziger A; Naumburg EH; Rosenberg T; McDaniel SH,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Awareness of sexual harassment (SH), gender bias (GB), and gender discrimination (GD) has spread throughout popular culture and has been highlighted at universities across the United States. More nuanced data is needed to inform policies that address these issues. However, there are currently limited qualitative studies examining the nature of SH, GB, and GD in academic medicine, particularly family medicine. METHODS: In 2018, we conducted a series of gender-specific focus groups with faculty and residents in a department of family medicine (DFM) to understand their experiences with and responses to SH, GB, and GD. The focus groups were transcribed verbatim. We used immersion-crystallization and an adapted SH Experiences model to review the transcripts and identify patterns or themes during the immersion process. RESULTS: Participants identified the potential for patients, colleagues, faculty, and themselves as perpetrators and victims of SH, GB, and GD. Results suggested that GB was often implicit. SH was experienced verbally and physically. Women participants, especially, reported that both SH and GB occurred frequently and had lasting psychological effects. Gender, age, and position (faculty vs trainee) moderated SH and GB experiences. The effects seemed to be mediated by moral distress.

"Implicit gender-career bias in postgraduate medical training still exists, mainly in residents and in females.",Kramer M; Heyligers IC; Könings KD,"BACKGROUND: More and more female residents enter postgraduate medical training (PGMT). Meanwhile, women are still underrepresented in academic medicine, in leadership positions and in most surgical specialties. This suggests that female residents' career development may still be negatively impacted by subtle, often unconscious stereotype associations regarding gender and career-ambition, called implicit gender-career bias. This study explored the existence and strength of implicit gender-career bias in doctors who currently work in PGMT, i.e. in attending physicians who act as clinical trainers and in their residents. METHODS: We tested implicit gender-career bias in doctors working in PGMT by means of an online questionnaire and an online Implicit Association Test (IAT). We used standard IAT analysis to calculate participants' IAT D scores, which indicate the direction and strength of bias. Linear regression analyses were used to test whether the strength of bias was related to gender, position (resident or clinical trainer) or specialty (non-surgical or surgical specialty). RESULTS: The mean IAT D score among 403 participants significantly differed from zero (D-score = 0.36 (SD = 0.39), indicating bias associating male with career and female with family. Stronger gender-career bias was found in women (β(female) =0 .11; CI 0.02; 0.19; p = 0.01) and in residents (β(resident) 0.12; CI 0.01; 0.23; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide a solid basis for explicitly addressing implicit gender-career bias in PGMT. The general understanding in the medical field is that gender bias is strongest among male doctors' in male-dominated surgical specialties. Contrary to this view, this study demonstrated that the strongest bias is held by females themselves and by residents, independently of their specialty. Apparently, the influx of female doctors in the medical field has not yet reduced implicit gender-career bias in the next generation of doctors, i.e. in today's residents, and in females.",2021,May,BMC Med Educ,21,1,253,,10.1186/s12909-021-02694-9,33933035,#19,Kramer 2021,"",""
Domestic tethers: Gender differences in career paths and domestic responsibilities of top-research medical school graduates.,Hitti E; Hadid D; Khoury SJ; Tamim H; Makki M; Karam CM,"INTRODUCTION: Gendered differences in career paths of medical graduates persist globally. We aim to explore the impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of physicians by studying gendered differences in domestic burdens of physicians as well as differences in perceptions around the impact of domestic work on professional advancement. METHODS: A web-based survey including 38 questions was sent to all 3866 physician alumni of the top academic medical school in Lebanon. Data was collected between November 2018 and January 2019, with up to three invite reminders. Overall, 382 were included in the final analysis, 124 women (32%), 258 men (68%). RESULTS: The study had a response rate of 10.4%. Findings show that a greater percentage of men were married and had children (77.5% vs 62.1%, p = 0.004, 77.9% vs 51.6%, <0.001, respectively). Majority of both women and men held full-time positions (82.1% and 87.1%), having children however reduced the odds significantly [OR = 0.2, 95% CI: (0.1-0.6), p = 0.01]for women, while only older age reduced it for men (OR = 0.1,95% CI: (0.04-0.2), p<0.001]. Among full-time physicians, men and women spent similar time on professional activities (60.2hrs/wk vs 58.3hrs/wk, p = 0.32). Women spent more time on parenting and household work (23.5hrs/wk vs 10.4hrs/wk, <0.001; 8.9hrs/wk vs 6.0hrs/wk, p = 0.001, respectively). Women physicians' spouses contributed to 14.5 hours/week of total time on domestic activities whereas men physicians' spouses spent two folds more time on domestic activities (35.0 hours/week, P<0.001). Of physicians with children, a higher percentage of women than men reported that children prevented their career advancement or their participation in development opportunities (43.8% vs 15.9%, p<0.001; 50.0% vs 19.4%, p<0.001, respectively). A greater percentage of women than men scaled back their career after first child (31.3% vs 3.5%, <0.001). Of married/partnered physicians, fewer women than men reported their career took priority over their partner's when conflicts arose, (52.0% vs 86.0%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the heavier impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of women physicians than men physicians. Men are more likely than women to hold full-time positions in the early advancement defining phases of their careers. Full-time women shoulder more domestic work than men and experience more professional advancement concessions.

Influences for Gender Disparity in Academic Family Medicine in North American Medical Schools.,Chen ST; Jalal S; Ahmadi M; Khurshid K; Bhulani N; Rehman AU; Ahmad A; Ding J; Aldred TR; Khosa F,"Background Women physicians continue to comprise the minority of leadership roles in Academic Family Medicine (AFM) faculty across North American medical schools. Our study quantified the current state of gender disparity by analyzing academic position, leadership ranking, and research productivity. Methods We generated a database for 6,746 AFM faculty members. Gender and academic profiles were obtained for 2,892 academic ranks and 1,706 leadership roles by searching faculty listings enlisted in Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) and Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). To measure research productivity, we obtained bibliometric data: h-index, citations, and tenure from 2,383 faculty members using Elsevier's SCOPUS archives. Data analysis and h-index were formulated using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Results Our results indicated that women hold 46.11% (3,110/6,746) of faculty positions. The proportional composition decreased with increasing academic ranking (49.84% assistant, 46.78% associate, and 41.5% full professor). The same decreasing trend was demonstrated with leadership rank (57.14% minor leadership, 47.65% second-in-command, and 36.61 first-in-command). Compared to their gender counterparts, women in AFM demonstrated lower publication productivity as measured by citation number (p=0.04) and years of study (p=0.008).

Surgical career choices of medical students in China: does gender bias play a role?,Zhou L; Liu B; Fu W; Wu W; Wang Y; Ju P; Zhang X; Liu G,"BACKGROUND: Gender bias in career choices has always been a matter of great concern, including in the field of medicine. This study reports on the current situation in this regard in China, including the reasons for Chinese medical students' willingness to engage in surgical careers; investigates their accounts of gender bias; and analyzes the effect of gender bias on their surgical career choices. METHODS: This study invited medical students from Harbin Medical University to fill out a non-mandatory questionnaire on whether they had witnessed gender bias, their surgical career intentions, and factors influencing their career intentions. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between continuous variables. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare the differences between the categorical variables, the Kendall correlation coefficient (tau) was used to assess the correlation between the reasons rankings reported by gender, and a multiple regression analysis was conducted by logit model. RESULTS: A total of 643 students responded to the questionnaire. Of them, 63.76% expressed a willingness for a surgical career, with ""interest"" being a key driving factor (73.41%). Almost all respondents (96.27%) answered that there were more male leaders in the surgical departments they had rotated through or had contacted. Only a few respondents reported gender barriers influencing recruitment (32.19%). However, witnessing gender bias (recruitment of male required) was correlated to choice of surgical career (P < 0.05). Females were less willing to pursue a career in surgery if they had witnessed gender barriers in surgical recruitment. Male dominance also correlated to the choice of a surgical career (P < 0.1). Of the respondents, 53.19% believed that surgery was not suitable for females; among female respondents, this number was 56.12%, higher than for male respondents. When females think that the surgical profession is not suitable for them, it reduces the possibility of their pursuing a career in surgery. CONCLUSION: Most medical students were interested in surgical care. Witnessing gender bias decreases females' willingness to pursue a career in surgery. It is necessary to stimulate medical students' interest in surgery when formulating strategies to promote surgical career choices, as well as to reduce gender bias in surgery; in this way, females' surgical careers should be ensured.",2022,May,BMC Med Educ,22,1,378,,10.1186/s12909-022-03453-0,35581632,#23,Zhou 2022,"",""

Gender differences in scholarly productivity of early-career transfusion medicine physicians.,Ipe TS; Tanhehco YC; Booth GS; Adkins BD,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Promotion in academic medicine requires evidence of the creation and dissemination of scholarly output, primarily through peer-reviewed publications. Studies demonstrate that scholarly activity and impact are lower for women physicians than for men physicians, especially during the early stages of their academic careers. This report reviewed physicians' academic productivity after passing their Blood Banking/Transfusion Medicine (BBTM) subspecialty exam to determine if gender discrepancies exist. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was designed to determine trends in scholarly activity for women physicians versus men physicians in BBTM. Indexed publications were reviewed using iCite, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Portfolio Analysis tool, from 1 January 2017 to 1 December 2021, for BBTM examinees who passed the sub-speciality fellowship exam in the years 2016 through 2018. RESULTS: Overall, women physicians had statistically significant fewer total career publications (median 6 vs. 9 cumulative papers, p = 0.03). Women published at a lower rate after passing BBTM boards, which was not statistically significant (0.7 vs. 1.3 publications per year). Other statistically significant findings include fewer early-career BBTM women physicians were first authors compared with men physicians (p = 0.03) and impact as assessed by relative citation ratio was higher for men (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there are gender differences in scholarly productivity and impact on early-career BBTM physicians. Given that this cohort of BBTM physicians are early-career professionals, the significant difference in first authorship publications between women and men physicians is especially concerning. Publication metrics should be followed to ensure equitable research environments for early-career BBTM physicians.",2024,May,Vox Sang,119,5,490-495,,10.1111/vox.13606,38469683,#25,Ipe 2024,"",""
Postural control and balance self-efficacy in women with fibromyalgia: are there differences?,Muto LH; Sauer JF; Yuan SL; Sousa A; Mango PC; Marques AP,"BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a rheumatic disease characterized by chronic widespread pain and symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and depression. Postural instability is a debilitating disorder increasingly recognized as part of FM. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare postural control and balance self-efficacy in women with and without FM and verify the association of these variables with pain, symptom severity, and strength. DESIGN: Case-control study SETTING: Physiotherapeutic Clinical Research and Electromyography Laboratory Department of Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. POPULATION: Case-control study of 117 women ranging from age 35 to 60 years. Of these, 67 had FM. METHODS: Posture control was assessed with the modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance with patients in forceplates, balance self-efficacy with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, pain severity with the Visual Analog Scale, tender point pain threshold with digital algometry, symptom severity with the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, and lower limb strength with a dynamometer. RESULTS: Individuals with FM had impaired postural control showing increased speed of oscillation of the center of gravity (P=0.004) and decreased balance self-efficacy (P<0.001). They had moderate to excellent correlations of balance self-efficacy with pain (r=0.7, P<0.01), muscle strength (r=0.52, P<0.01), and symptom severity (r=0.78, P<0.10) compared with the control group. Correlation of postural control with the same variables was weak. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FM have impaired postural control and low balance self-efficacy that are associated with pain, muscle strength, and symptom severity. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Postural control and balance self-efficacy needs to be assessed in patients with FM and the treatment goals should be the improvement of postural control and balance self-efficacy.",2015,Apr,Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,51,2,149-54,,,24755776,#26,Muto 2015,"",""
"Elite career expectations of adolescents: Popularity, gender differences, and social divides.",Guo L; Hau KT,"INTRODUCTION: The supply of elite professionals is crucial for economic development, yet little is understood about the appeal and influencing factors of these careers among young people across different economies. It remains unclear whether adolescents in academically high-performing economies growingly expect emerging technological jobs in response to evolving workforce demands. METHODS: This research used the Programme for International Student Assessment 2000-2018 data in 24 high-performing educational systems to examine the two-decade trends in adolescents' expectations for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), medicine, law, business, and teaching careers. The popularity trend of these careers and the major impacts of gender, socioeconomic status, and academic ability were examined with multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: The findings indicated that developed economies such as Singapore, Canada, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom have successfully attracted a greater proportion of students to elite careers. In contrast, many high-performing Asian economies, such as Korea, Japan, and Taipei, have not. STEM and medical fields primarily drew students with high math abilities, whereas legal professions attracted those with superior reading skills. Although girls generally expected teaching and legal careers and boys expected STEM fields, social and gender differences have narrowed over the past decades. CONCLUSIONS: Many Western developed economies effectively attract a larger share of adolescents to STEM careers than their Asian counterparts. Although gender and social disparities persist, their impact has diminished. Effective human resource planning should be based on each country's unique trends and influencing factors to promote greater equality and inclusion in the workforce.",2024,Dec,J Adolesc,96,8,1805-1821,,10.1002/jad.12381,39041352,#27,Guo 2024,"",""
Gender Differences in Personal and Organizational Mechanisms to Address Burnout Among Family Physicians.,Eden AR; Jabbarpour Y; Morgan ZJ; Dai M; Coffman M; Bazemore A,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined how interventions designed to address physician burnout might impact female and male physicians differently. Our aim was to test whether there are gender differences in individual approaches to address burnout and/or in organizational support aimed at physician well-being. METHODS: An online survey was administered in 2019 to family physicians in California and Illinois who are either board certified by the American Board of Family Medicine, a member of their state Academy of Family Physicians, or both. Descriptive statistics and bivariate independence tests were performed for each personal step and organizational support to determine whether there was any gender difference. RESULTS: A total of 2176 family physicians (58% female and 42% male) responded to the survey. A total of 55% of female and 50% of male physicians were burned out. Female physicians were more likely to reduce work hours/go part time and to use domestic help; males were more likely to spend more time on hobbies. Only 8% reported taking no personal steps to address burnout. Male and female physicians reported similar types of organizational support aimed at physician wellness; yet, 20% reported that their organization did not provide any type of well-being support.

Perceptions of Gender and Race Equality in Leadership and Advancement Among Military Family Physicians.,Massaquoi MA; Reese TR; Barrett J; Nguyen D,"INTRODUCTION: There is increasing interest in assessing gender and race-based disparities in academic medicine and healthcare leadership in civilian medicine and the U.S. Military Health System. Approximately 15% of U.S. active duty service members are women, and racial minorities are 30% of the total active duty force. This study evaluates the following factors among uniformed services family physicians: gender and race representation in attaining early career leadership positions during training and 2 years postresidency; perceptions regarding leadership opportunities and career advancement. METHODS: Registered attendees (n = 300) of the 2016 Uniformed Services Academy of Family Physicians Annual Meeting were given a voluntary and anonymous online questionnaire. The main outcomes measured were early leadership assignments and perceptions about command/leadership support, gender roles in leadership assignment, confidence to achieve leadership goals, and being passed over for leadership positions. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of registered attendees completed the study questionnaire. Statistically significant results, adjusting for service, grade, race, and gender, were that non-Caucasian family physicians were less likely to be chief residents (odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.01-1.00) and less likely to have leadership positions within 2 years postresidency (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.91). Female family physicians were more likely to agree that gender has a role in assigning leadership positions (odds ratio 2.33, 95% CI 1.01-5.39). There were no differences in perceptions of command support for leadership; confidence in achieving desired leadership level; or in being passed over for leadership positions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important information about perceived gender and race equality among uniformed services family physicians. Key findings included that non-Caucasian military family physicians were less likely to attain junior leadership positions or be assigned to academic settings; and female respondents were more likely to agree that gender has a role in assignment of leadership positions.

"Gender Differences among Healthcare Providers in the Promotion of Patient-, Person- and Family-Centered Care-And Its Implications for Providing Quality Healthcare.",Lim SA; Khorrami A; Wassersug RJ; Agapoff JA,"The concept of ""patient-centered care"" (PCC) emphasizes patients' autonomy and is commonly promoted as a good healthcare practice that all of medicine should strive for. Here, we assessed how six medical specialties-pediatrics, OBGYN, orthopedics, radiology, dermatology, and neurosurgery-have engaged with PCC and its derivative concepts of ""person-centered care"" (PeCC) and ""family-centered care"" (FCC) as a function of the number of female physicians in each field. To achieve this, we conducted a scoping review of three databases-PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo-to assess the extent that PCC, PeCC, FCC, and RCC were referenced by different specialties in the medical literature. Reference to PCC and PeCC in the literature correlates significantly with the number of female physicians in each field (all p < 0.00001) except for neurosurgery (p > 0.5). Pediatrics shows the most extensive reference to PCC, followed by OBGYN, with a significant difference between all disciplines (p < 0.001). FCC remains exclusively embraced by pediatrics.

Framework for advancing equity in academic medicine and science: Perspectives from early career female faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Spencer S; Burrows C; Lacher SE; Macheledt KC; Berge JM; Ghebre RG,"Early-career female faculty, both physician scientists and basic researchers, have disproportionately experienced negative professional, financial, and personal consequences associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This career phase represents a critical time for establishing a network of mentors and collaborators, demonstrating professional independence, and balancing new teaching, research, and service duties while simultaneously navigating personal and familial responsibilities. Persistent gender inequality perpetuated by adherence to traditional gender roles place early-career women faculty at a further disadvantage. Women in academic medicine and research do not attain promotion, leadership positions, and other established markers of success at the same rate as their male counterparts.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of our work are to assess data on medical students' choice of surgical specialty in Italy to investigate if a gender-biased trend exists and to find the key points that influence the decision-making process when choosing a specialty, with a focus on Urology. DESIGN: Data about access to residency programs in 2017-2020 were analysed through descriptive statistics. Investigations concerning the decision-making process were carried through distribution of an online anonymous survey to Italian medical students. RESULTS: Urology was among the specialties with the lowest proportion of female residents in Italy in the last 4 years: 37 (29.4%) in 2017, 27 (21.4%) in 2018, 40 (26.7%) in 2019, and 57 (25.2%) in 2020. The total number of participants of the survey was 1409, of which only 341 declared being keen to pursue a career path in surgery. Out of the 942 students not interested in surgery, 46.2% females and 22.5% males indicated a ""sexist environment"" as one of the reasons. Overall, the main reason for medical students not choosing Urology is the lack of interest in the specialty. Furthermore, there is a different perception of Urology as a sexist environment between female (23.4%) and male (3.2%, p < 0.001) medical students, which may influence their decision-making process. CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, the prevalence of female medical graduates does not mirror the proportion of female doctors choosing a career in some surgical specialties, including Urology.

Gender difference in preference of specialty as a career choice among Japanese medical students.,Kawamoto R; Ninomiya D; Kasai Y; Kusunoki T; Ohtsuka N; Kumagi T; Abe M,"BACKGROUND: In Japan, the absolute deficiency of doctors and maldistribution of doctors by specialty is a significant problem in the Japanese health care system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors contributing to specialty preference in career choice among Japanese medical students. METHODS: A total of 368 medical students completed the survey giving an 88.2 % response rate. The subjects comprised 141 women aged 21 ± 3 (range, 18-34) years and 227 men aged 22 ± 4 (range, 18-44) years. Binary Logistic regression analysis was performed using specialty preferences as the criterion variable and the factors in brackets as six motivational variables (e.g., Factor 1: educational experience; Factor 2: job security; Factor 3: advice from others; Factor 4: work-life balance; Factor 5: technical and research specialty; and Factor 6: personal reasons). RESULTS: Women significantly preferred pediatrics, obstetrics & gynecology, and psychology than the men. Men significantly preferred surgery and orthopedics than the women. For both genders, a high odds ratio (OR) of ""technical & research specialty"" and a low OR for ""personal reasons"" were associated with preference for surgery. ""Technical & research specialty"" was positively associated with preference for special internal medicine and negatively for pediatrics. ""Work-life balance"" was positively associated with preference for psychology and negatively for emergency medicine. Among the women only, ""technical & research specialty"" was negatively associated with preference for general medicine/family medicine and obstetrics & gynecology, and ""job security"" was positively associated for general medicine/family medicine and negatively for psychology. Among men only, ""educational experience"" and ""personal reasons"" were positively, and ""job security"" was negatively associated with preference for pediatrics.

No studies have evaluated work-life integration and career satisfaction in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) or explored gender differences for these outcomes. This study aims to (1) compare work-life integration, career satisfaction, and burnout in women and men PEM physicians and (2) compare associated individual and occupational factors to distinguish modifiable factors. METHODS: We distributed an electronic survey to assess well-being parameters in PEM physicians. We assessed career satisfaction and work-life integration with single-item measures. We used a 2-item screen to measure burnout. We performed descriptive analyses, univariate analysis to compare gender differences, and multivariate logistic regression analysis for each outcome. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-nine PEM physicians participated, yielding a response rate of 50% (57% women; age range, 30-80 years). Overall satisfaction with work-life integration was 42.9%, with 34.3% of women reporting appropriate work-life integration, compared with 55.4% of men ( P = 0.001). Career satisfaction rate was 77.8%, with 71.6% of women reporting career satisfaction, compared with 86.1% of men ( P = 0.008). Burnout rate was 44.5%, with 53.7% of women reporting burnout compared with 33.7% of men ( P = 0.002).

This study aimed to examine the extent of gender disparities in career advancement and promotion among academic faculty in surgery and understand the influence of academic productivity. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using publicly available information from online faculty profiles of 18 large academic US general surgery residency programs. Gender equality was examined overall and as subgroups by career stage (late-, mid-, and early-career) to account for differences over time. Logistic regression identified factors associated with gender disparities. Mediation analysis examined if the gender difference in academic advancement was mediated by academic productivity. RESULTS: Of the 1467 faculty members, 388 (26.4%) were women. Gender disparity in academic advancement was observed in the early-career cohort (33.4% versus 23.8%, P = 0.006). Women in the early-career cohort were nearly 40% less likely to achieve academic advancement (odds ratio 0.62 [95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88]) and more than 50% less likely to have >30 publications (odds ratio 0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.32-0.63]) than men. The effect of gender was no longer significant once publication volume and fellowship training was incorporated into the model on multivariable regression. Mediation analysis showed that >30 publications mediated nearly 67% of the effect of gender on academic advancement in the early-career cohort.

Gender differences in sexual and reproductive health education in the family: a mixed methods study on Romanian young people.,Faludi C; Rada C,"BACKGROUND: The family is one of the key factors that can contribute to reducing the negative consequences of high-risk sexual behavior. This study examines the influence of parents' communication with children on issues of sexuality on sexual behavior. METHODS: The study is based on a mixed research design. In 2013-2014, 1,359 people aged 18-30 years were randomly selected from urban areas covering the main university centers of Romania, and they completed a questionnaire with 60 items regarding sociodemographic data, family, sexual behavior and health risks. Out of the initial sample, 60 participants agreed to participate in face-to-face interviews, using a thematic interview guide. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive inferential statistics, including binary logistic regression. The qualitative data were investigated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Exploring the issues of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) discussed with parents according to gender revealed that there was a greater concern in families to address issues of sexuality with girls. The manifestation of any form of sex education in the family was positively associated with a healthy sexual debut, both for women and men (χ2 = 7.759, χ2 = 7.866, p = 0.005). The results of the regression reinforced the idea that a lack of sex education in the family decreased the likelihood of a healthy sexual debut, both in women (OR: 0.668, p = 0.018) and in men (OR: 0.605, p = 0.013). In men, receiving information about sex at a younger age (OR: 0.335, p = 0.001) reduced the chance of a healthy sexual debut. Younger women and men were more likely than older women and men to experience a healthy sexual debut [odds ratio (OR): 1.861, p < 0.001 and OR: 1.644, p = 0.015, respectively]. Qualitative results revealed that SRH talks were generally initiated by young people, usually involved a parent of the same gender and often occurred after events in the sexual lives of young people (after first menstruation/after sexual debut). CONCLUSIONS: In designing health programs for adolescents and youth, the family should be involved in sex education. Modeling family sex education by gender can produce differentiated effects on the sexual debut of men and women.",2019,Aug,BMC Public Health,19,1,1103,,10.1186/s12889-019-7321-0,31412812,#40,Faludi 2019,"",""
Equity for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM: Graduate experiences and career plans in chemistry.,Stockard J; Rohlfing CM; Richmond GL,"Recent events prompted scientists in the United States and throughout the world to consider how systematic racism affects the scientific enterprise. This paper provides evidence of inequities related to race-ethnicity and gender in graduate school experiences and career plans of PhD students in the top 100 ranked departments in one science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) discipline, chemistry. Mixed-model regression analyses were used to examine factors that might moderate these differences. The results show that graduate students who identified as a member of a racial/ethnic group traditionally underrepresented in chemistry (underrepresented minorities, URM) were significantly less likely than other students to report that their financial support was sufficient to meet their needs. They were also less likely to report having supportive relationships with peers and postdocs. Women, and especially URM women, were significantly less likely to report supportive relationships with advisors. Despite their more negative experiences in graduate school, students who identified as URM expressed greater commitment to finishing their degree and staying in the field. When there was at least one faculty member within their departments who also identified as URM they were also more likely than other students to aspire to a university professorship with an emphasis on research. Men were significantly more likely than women to express strong commitment to finishing the PhD and remaining in chemistry, but this difference was stronger in top-ranked departments. Men were also more likely than women to aspire to a professorship with an emphasis on research, and this difference remained when individual and departmental-level variables were controlled.",2021,Jan,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,118,4,,,10.1073/pnas.2020508118,33431653,#41,Stockard 2021,"",""
"Gender Differences in Publication Productivity, Academic Rank, and Career Duration Among U.S. Academic Gastroenterology Faculty.",Diamond SJ; Thomas CR Jr; Desai S; Holliday EB; Jagsi R; Schmitt C; Enestvedt BK,"PURPOSE: Female representation in academic medicine is increasing without proportional increases in female representation at senior ranks. The purpose of this study is to describe the gender representation in academic gastroenterology (GI) and compare publication productivity, academic rank, and career duration between male and female gastroenterologists. METHOD: In 2014, the authors collected data including number of publications, career duration, h-index, and m-index for faculty members at 114 U.S. academic GI programs. RESULTS: Of 2,440 academic faculty, 1,859 (76%) were men and 581 (24%) were women. Half (50%) of men held senior faculty position compared with 29% of women (P < .001). Compared with female faculty, male faculty had significantly (P < .001) longer careers (20 vs. 11 years), more publications (median 24 [0-949] vs. 9 [0-438]), and higher h-indices (8 vs. 4). Higher h-index correlated with higher academic rank (P < .001). The authors detected no difference in the h-index between men and women at the same rank for professor, associate professor, and instructor, nor any difference in the m-index between men and women (0.5 vs. 0.46, respectively, P = .214). CONCLUSIONS: A gender gap exists in the number and proportion of women in academic GI; however, after correcting for career duration, productivity measures that consider quantity and impact are similar for male and female faculty. Women holding senior faculty positions are equally productive as their male counterparts. Early and continued career mentorship will likely lead to continued increases in the rise of women in academic rank.",2016,Aug,Acad Med,91,8,1158-63,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001219,27144993,#42,Diamond 2016,"",""

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1061 patients (of which 308 had no CCs and 753 of those had one or more CCs) recruited at primary health care centres and the Internal Medicine Clinic at Tartu University Hospital in Estonia. Data were collected during 2012-2014. The patient's age, self-reported smoking status, alcohol consumption (assessed by Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and body mass index were used as independent variables to predict the physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) of HRQoL (assessed by SF-36). RESULTS: Smoking had a negative association with both physical and mental components of HRQoL only in women with CCs. Further, the PCS of chronically ill women was negatively associated with the higher body mass index. Harmful drinking had a negative association with the HRQoL in all patient groups, except with the PCS in women with CC. Light alcohol consumption without symptoms of harmful use or dependency had a positive association with the physical and mental HRQoL in all patient groups, except with the MCS in women without CCs.

We sought to evaluate differences by sex in the supply, payments and clinical activity among FPs in Ontario. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using claims data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. We included all Ontario FPs who submitted claims from 1992 to 2018. We analyzed data using regression analyses for our outcomes of yearly number of FPs, payments, patient visits and distinct patients. RESULTS: The number of practising FPs increased from 10 370 in 1992 to 14 329 in 2018, with an annual increase of 155 female FPs and 13 male FPs. In 2018, male FPs outnumbered female FPs by 1159. Among male FPs, 32.7% worked less than 1 full-time equivalent (FTE) position, 18.1% worked 1 FTE and 49.2% worked more than 1 FTE, with little change over the 27-year study period. Among female FPs, the percentage of those who worked less than 1 FTE position decreased over time (58.6% in 1998 to 48.3% in 2015), those who worked 1 FTE was stable (22.2%-24.3%) and those who worked more than 1 FTE increased (18.7% in 1998 to 28.0% in 2017). Yearly payments were higher for male FPs than female FPs by 40%-60% overall and by 10%-20% in FPs who worked more than 1 FTE. For FPs who worked 1 FTE or less than 1 FTE, both sexes had similar payment amounts (from 2005-2018). For FPs who worked 1 FTE, female FPs were less likely to receive payments from fee-for-service after 2004, and had 550 fewer visits and 121 fewer patients annually than male FPs. INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, there are differences by sex in FP supply, payments, percentages of FTE groups, number of patient visits and number of distinct patients.

Women's Experiences of Promotion and Tenure in Academic Medicine and Potential Implications for Gender Disparities in Career Advancement: A Qualitative Analysis.,Murphy M; Callander JK; Dohan D; Grandis JR,"IMPORTANCE: Gender disparities in career advancement in academic medicine have persisted despite gender parity in medical school matriculation. Although numerous explanations for this gap exist, little is known about women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine. OBJECTIVE: To examine women's experiences of promotion and tenure in academic medicine to uncover mechanisms associated with the gender disparity in career advancement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, 52 in-depth, semistructured interviews with women academic medicine faculty members were conducted in 2019. The 52 participants were drawn from 16 medical schools across the US. Institutions were selected using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity of geography and ownership (private or public). Within institutions, purposive and snowball sampling were used to seek diversity with respect to respondents' degree type (MD, PhD, and MD and PhD), age, and career stage. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Data analysis was performed from March to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes and subthemes in participants' experiences of promotion and tenure. RESULTS: The 52 women in this study ranged in age from 34 to 82 years (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [10.7] years). Eighteen respondents (34.6%) held an MD, 4 (7.7%) held both an MD and PhD, and 30 (57.7%) held a PhD. Fourteen respondents (26.9%) were assistant professors at the time of the study, 8 (15.4%) were associate professors, and 30 (57.7%) were full professors. Four main themes within participants' experiences of promotion and tenure that pertain to gender inequities were identified: ambiguous or inconsistent criteria for promotion or tenure; lack of standard processes for reviewing applications and making decisions; vulnerability to malicious behavior of senior faculty, department chairs, and division chiefs; and women seeing men have different experiences of advancement.

Sex Differences Among Career Development Awardees in the Attainment of Independent Research Funding in a Department of Medicine.,Kalyani RR; Yeh HC; Clark JM; Weisfeldt ML; Choi T; MacDonald SM,"BACKGROUND: National data suggest that women are overall less likely than men to attain independent research funding. However, it remains unclear whether such sex differences are also observed in academic institutions that have integrated diversity in the workplace as a priority. METHODS: During 1999-2008, all National Institutes of Health (NIH) Career Development (K01, K08, or K23) awardees in the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine were identified to investigate differences in the attainment of independent funding by sex, including NIH Research Project Grant (R01) or equivalent awards, (U01, P01, P50), and any R award (also R03, R21, R34) through 2012. RESULTS: A similar number of men (n = 49) and women (n = 43) received a K award. There were no significant sex differences in attaining an R01/equivalent award or any R award. The median time to attaining the first R01/equivalent award was similar for men and women (5.6 vs. 5.3 years, p = 0.93). The actuarial rate of R01/equivalent award attainment at 10 years was 64% overall (56% among men vs. 74% among women; log-rank p = 0.41). For any R award, the rate was 72% overall (70% among men vs. 76% among women; log-rank p = 0.63). In Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree, and funding period, sex was not an independent predictor of R01/equivalent or any R award attainment. Interestingly, black race and/or Hispanic ethnicity significantly predicted any R award attainment (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.37).

Gender equity at last: a national study of medical students considering a career in rural medicine.,Kim C; Ngo H; Playford D,"BACKGROUND: The rural medical workforce internationally suffers from a significant imbalance between male- and female- identifying practitioners. Not only do male doctors outnumber female doctors, but additionally female doctors work fewer hours than their male counterparts. This has health implications for rural communities. In response, In Australia, Rural Clinical Schools (RCSs) are a national training strategy to increase the number of graduates entering the rural medical workforce. It has been observed that RCSs attract a greater number of female students than male students. However, the future work intentions of male versus female RCS students is not known. This paper therefore asked whether male and female RCS students have equivalent intent for future rural practice. METHODS: Participants were all students who attended RCSs from 2015 to 2017, who completed an exit survey that gathered data on demographic, experiential and intentional variables. Univariate analyses examined differences between the sexes. A multivariate model was constructed to determine the independent predictors for rural intention. RESULTS: There were 2017 respondents across the 3 years, of whom 937 identified as male, and 1138 identified as female. In univariate analysis, female-identifying students had significantly higher rural intention than male-identifying students. There were no other sex-based differences in age, rural background, overall perception of support, and overall excellence of clinical education whilst in RCS. However, in multivariate analysis, sex was not a significant predictor for rural work intention, whereas older age, rural background, and first preference for RCS were all predictive of increased rural intent, as expected from the literature. There were no differences between male and female students in their perceptions of the overall support and the clinical education provided by RCS. CONCLUSION: We conclude from this national study that sex is not an independent predictor for future rural work intention among RCS students. Considering the disproportionate number of female students entering RCS, this is reassuring for ultimately achieving rural workforce gender equity.",2020,Nov,BMC Med Educ,20,1,432,,10.1186/s12909-020-02355-3,33198731,#48,Kim 2020,"",""

We find that female faculty have significantly fewer distinct co-authors over their careers than males, but that this difference can be fully accounted for by females' lower publication rate and shorter career lengths. Next, we find that female scientists have a lower probability of repeating previous co-authors than males, an intriguing result because prior research shows that teams involving new collaborations produce work with higher impact.

Gender differences in the perception of quality of life during internal medicine training: a qualitative and quantitative analysis.,Kobayasi R; Tempski PZ; Arantes-Costa FM; Martins MA,"BACKGROUND: The higher level of participation by women in medicine may impact this profession's evolution due to gender differences perceived during medical school, after graduation and during residency. Gender differences regarding quality of life are associated with higher states of anxiety and depression among female physicians. We aimed to assess gender differences in the perception of quality of life with quantitative methods and to understand further, from the female residents´ point of view, the reasons that may influence the perception of quality of life using qualitative method. Resilience, empathy and daytime sleepiness were also scored. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study with first-year internal medicine residents to evaluate self-reported quality of life factors specific to medical residents (VERAS-Q), including empathy (Jefferson Scale of Empathy), resilience (Wagnild and Young Brief Resilience Scale) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Scale). We explored, from the female residents´ view which factors may influence the perception of quality of life using a focus group method. RESULTS: In our study, one hundred and nine residents completed the survey: 31 (28.4%) were female and 78 (71.6%) were male. Female residents exhibited significantly lower scores than those of male residents for quality of life in the domains of time management (30.3, females vs 41.1, males; p < 0.001), psychology (48.1, females vs 56.7, males; p < 0.01) and physical health (42.8, females vs 53.6, males; p < 0.05). Female residents also scored higher for daytime sleepiness (13.0, females vs 9.0, males; p < 0.001), with pathological scores for daytime sleepiness. No significant gender differences were found in the resilience or empathy scores. The focus group assessment revealed difficulty in concentration and knowledge acquisition, insecurity, feelings of loss, greater critical perception, self-doubt and difficulty in creating effective bonds to support the training period as the main factors involved in the lower perception of quality of life among the women.

Combining detailed career- and administrative register data on 976 Danish social scientists in Business and Management, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology (5703 person-years) that obtained a PhD degree between 2000 and 2015, we estimate gender differences in attainment of senior research positions and parse out how publication outputs, parenthood and parental leave contribute to these differences. Our approach is advantageous over previous longitudinal studies in that we track the careers and publication outputs of graduates from the outset of their PhD education and match this data with time-sensitive information on each individual's publication activities and family situation. In discrete time-event history models, we observe a ∼24 per cent female disadvantage in advancement likelihoods within the first 7 years after PhD graduation, with gender differences increasing over the observation period. A decomposition indicates that variations in publishing, parenthood and parental leave account for ∼ 40 per cent of the gender gap in career advancement, suggesting that other factors, including recruitment disparities, asymmetries in social capital and experiences of unequal treatment at work, may also constrain women's careers.",2024,Jun,Br J Sociol,75,3,322-346,,10.1111/1468-4446.13088,38549173,#51,Nielsen 2024,"",""

Male and female residents in postgraduate medical education - A gender comparative analysis of differences in career perspectives and their conditions in Germany.,Ziegler S; Zimmermann T; Krause-Solberg L; Scherer M; van den Bussche H,"Aim: This article focuses on the gender-specific career differences of residents in their postgraduate medical education in Germany. In particular the structural obstacles female physicians have to overcome during residency are investigated. Moreover, the study examines the position preferences of male and female physicians in the hospital and in how far occupational self-efficacy corresponds to the interest in a hospital leading position. Methods: The KarMed-Study's database consists of annual postal surveys throughout the entire residency of medical students, who were in their ""Practical Year"" in 2008/2009. Descriptive statistics and regression models were used in the analysis. Results: Male and female physicians differ in terms of their preferred work place (hospital, ambulatory care, others), hospital position and working hours. Female physicians prefer part-time work and rarely assume leading positions compared to male physicians. In addition, female physicians, especially those with children, need more time to complete their postgraduate training. Female physicians with children are burdened and disadvantaged more often than their female colleagues without children as well as male physicians in general (e.g. belated start and completion of residency, lower rate of doctorate titles, higher quota of part-time contracts, short-term employment contracts, and higher rates of residency interruption or termination). Besides gender and doctorate title, the occupational self-efficacy expectation has an influence on the preference of leading positions in hospitals. Respondents with a low occupational self-efficacy score are less likely to strive for leading positions with more responsibilities than those with a high score. Conclusion: The results demonstrate clear gender disparities in postgraduate training. Female physicians, especially those with children, are disadvantaged in various areas when compared with their male colleagues. In particular, the low rate of doctorate titles and the low score of self-efficacy expectation are associated negatively with the willingness to aim at leading positions in hospitals. Special measures and programmes should be developed for female physicians to counteract these differences.",2017,,GMS J Med Educ,34,5,Doc53,,10.3205/zma001130,29226221,#53,Ziegler 2017,"",""

METHOD: For 82 domestic academic radiation oncology departments, the authors identified current faculty and recorded their academic rank, degree, and gender. The authors recorded bibliographic metrics for physician faculty from a commercially available database (Scopus, Elsevier BV), including numbers of publications from 1996 to 2012 and h-indices. The authors then concatenated these data with National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding per Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools. The authors performed descriptive and correlative analyses, stratifying by gender and rank. RESULTS: Of 1,031 faculty, 293 (28%) women and 738 (72%) men, men had a higher median m-index, 0.58 (range 0-3.23) versus 0.47 (0-2.5) (P < .05); h-index, 8 (0-59) versus 5 (0-39) (P < .05); and publication number, 26 (0-591) versus 13 (0-306) (P < .05). Men were more likely to be senior faculty and receive NIH funding. After stratifying for rank, these differences were largely nonsignificant. On multivariate analysis, there were correlations between gender, career duration and academic position, and h-index (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of a successful career in academic medicine are multifactorial.

Social support coping style predicts women's cortisol in the laboratory and daily life: the moderating role of social attentional biases.,Sladek MR; Doane LD; Jewell SL; Luecken LJ,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social stress and associated coping responses can profoundly influence women's stress physiology and health. Implicit social attentional biases can also influence psychological and physiological stress responses. The purpose of this study was to explore whether a coping style characterized by greater use of social support predicts indices of cortisol activity in laboratory and daily life contexts among female university students. We hypothesized that the relation of this coping style to cortisol activity would be moderated by women's attentional biases. METHODS: Seventy-four women (M(age )= 19.44, range: 17.8-27.8, 64% White) completed an interpersonal stress task and an attentional bias task in the lab, along with a self-report coping inventory. Participants provided five saliva samples during the lab protocol, followed by three saliva samples per day for three consecutive weekdays. Outcome measures included cortisol response to lab tasks (AUCg), diurnal cortisol slope, diurnal AUCg, and cortisol awakening response (CARi). RESULTS: A coping style characterized by greater use of social support predicted lower lab AUCg and lower, flatter average diurnal cortisol slope for women with attentional avoidance compared to women with attentional vigilance (ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Responding to stress by using social support is linked to lower cortisol responses to social stress and diurnal cortisol activity for women with implicit avoidance of social threat cues.",2017,Jan,Anxiety Stress Coping,30,1,66-81,,10.1080/10615806.2016.1181754,27189781,#55,Sladek 2017,"",""
"Differences in Empathy Levels of Medical Students Based on Gender, Year of Medical School and Career Choice.",Tariq N; Tayyab A; Jaffery T,"OBJECTIVE: To measure mean empathy scores of Pakistani medical students and to explore any association of empathy scores with gender, medical school year and future career choice. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa College of Medicine, Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, during the academic year 2015-2016. METHODOLOGY: The student version of Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) was distributed to the students electronically via the student portal. Response that were completed in full were included in the study. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse student demographic data. The student score on the JSPE was reported as the mean (out of 7) of each item. Independent samples t-test was employed to check the significant differences between genders. Empathy score with advancing year of study was investigated using ANOVA. ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's test was used to study the relationship between career choice and empathy score. RESULTS: The response rate was 70.94%. The mean score was 4.51 ±0.69. Females obtained greater, but statistically insignificant (p=0.08) empathy score (4.58) as compared to the male students (4.45). No statistically significant difference was seen between scores on the survey across the five academic years (F=0.88, p=0.47). Students who selected medicine and allied as career choice showed a significantly higher empathy score than those who opted for surgery. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.78. CONCLUSION: There were low levels of empathy in Pakistani medical students. Students with interest in medicine and allied showed higher empathy scores compared to surgical or technical specialties.

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are frequently employed. In the current clinical investigation, we assessed the effects of sex on the safety and effectiveness of medications used to treat neuropathic pain. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis between 1 February 2021 and 20 April 2024, involving patients with neuropathic pain referred to the Ambulatory of Pain Medicine of ""Renato Dulbecco"" University Hospital in Catanzaro (Calabria, Italy). Patients over 18 years old with signs of neuropathic pain (Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questionnaire ≥ 4) were included. Exclusion criteria comprised patients with Alzheimer's disease; patients with nociplastic or nociceptive pain; and patients with neoplasms. Patients with fewer than two accesses to ambulatory care were excluded, as were those who did not sign the informed consent. Clinical data were collected from each enrolled patient and subsequently analyzed, considering clinical outcomes. Sex and gender differences in efficacy were estimated using multivariate linear modeling and propensity-score matching. Results: During the study, 531 patients were screened, and 174 were enrolled (33.5%, mean age 61.5 ± 13.1; 64 males and 110 females, mean age 60.6 ± 13.4 and 61.96 ± 13.0) in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only minor differences in treatment prescription were observed based on age, body mass index, and comorbidities. Smoking, sex, educational level, and body mass index did not induce a significant change in pain perception. Males required slightly higher, though not significantly, doses of drugs for pain control than females. The treatment was not significantly more effective for females than for males. Females did not exhibit a significantly lower number of adverse drug reactions compared to males. Conclusions: The current study found that there are no appreciable differences between the sexes when it comes to the treatment of neuropathic pain.",2024,Sep,J Clin Med,13,19,,,10.3390/jcm13195682,39407742,#57,Marcianò 2024,"",""
Osteopathic Medical Students Entering Family Medicine and Attitudes Regarding Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: Preliminary Findings of Differences by Sex.,Baker HH; Linsenmeyer M; Ridpath LC; Bauer LJ; Foster RW,"CONTEXT: Factors distinguishing osteopathic physicians from their allopathic counterparts include the use of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), application of osteopathic principles and practice (OPP), and a greater likelihood of entering primary care, specifically family medicine (FM). In the United States, the percentage of entering osteopathic medical students who were female rose from 14.3% in fall 1977 to 44.3% in fall 2015. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the perspectives of female osteopathic medical students as they relate to osteopathic distinctiveness. METHODS: Students at the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine who were eligible to participate in graduation exercises in 2014 or 2015 were asked to complete the school's standard Exit Survey. The research team chose 5 items from the survey to include in the current analysis. Sex had been self-identified at admission, and residency in first postgraduate year was categorized as FM or other specialty. Graduates entering a transitional year or traditional internship were removed from analysis. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted for 308 of the 375 students (82%) expected to graduate in 2014 or 2015. χ2 analysis found no difference by sex in the number of graduates entering FM residencies vs other specialties (P=.727). Statistically significant differences were found in 2 survey items: ""Use of OMT will enhance my practice"" (P=.005) and ""What emphasis do you believe OMT will have in your practice?"" (P<.001). Graduating female students responded more favorably to OMT on both items. For the latter item, 91.4% of female and 80.3% of male students indicated OMT would have at least some role in their practices. Sex differences remained after statistically controlling for entry into FM. CONCLUSION: Female graduating osteopathic medical students were more likely to report that OMT will have at least some role in their practices.

Gender income differences among general practitioners with compulsory services in early career stage in underdeveloped areas: evidence from a prospective cohort study in China.,Tang H; Li M; Zheng H; Zhang X; Liu X,"BACKGROUND: Gender equality and the gender income gap in medicine are long-standing global problems. Although gender-related differences have been widely studied in developed countries, they remain unclear in underdeveloped regions. In 2010, China initiated a national compulsory service program (CSP) to train qualified general practitioners in rural and remote areas. This study aimed to evaluate gender income differences for early career CSP and non-CSP (NCSP) graduates in underdeveloped areas. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted with 3620 CSP and NCSP graduates from four medical universities in Central and Western China. Baseline surveys and six follow-up surveys were conducted between 2015 and 2022. Incomes, including monthly mean income and proportion of performance-based income, were measured as the key outcome variables. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify the gender income gap. RESULTS: NCSP graduates had higher average monthly incomes than CSP graduates. In the seventh year after graduation, the average monthly income for NCSP graduates was 7859 CNY while was 5379 CNY for CSP graduates. After controlling for demographic characteristics, the gender monthly income gap for CSP graduates was expanded from the fourth year (3.0%) to the sixth year (5.9%) after graduation, and that for NCSP graduates was expanded from the fifth year (11.9%) to the seventh year (16.3%) after graduation. Regarding performance-based income, it was 58.9% for NCSP graduates and 45.8% for CSP graduates in the seventh year after graduation. After controlling for performance-based income proportion, the gender income gap was reduced from 5.9 to 4.0% in the sixth year after graduation for CSP graduates, and from 16.3 to 14.4% for NCSP graduates in the seventh year after graduation. CONCLUSION: An extensive and ever-increasing gender income gap exists among young doctors in the early stages of their careers in underdeveloped areas of China. The high proportion of performance-based income among men is one of the main explanations for the observed difference. A more explicit compensation system must be established to enhance support for female health workers.",2024,Jun,Hum Resour Health,22,1,45,,10.1186/s12960-024-00930-z,38937757,#59,Tang 2024,"",""
Professional Success and Gender in Family Medicine: Design of Scales and Examination of Gender Differences in Subjective and Objective Success Among Family Physicians.,Delgado A; Saletti-Cuesta L; López-Fernández LA; Toro-Cárdenas S; Luna del Castillo Jde D,"Two components of professional success have been defined: objective career success (OCS) and subjective career success (SCS). Despite the increasing number of women practicing medicine, gender inequalities persist. The objectives of this descriptive, cross-sectional, and multicenter study were (a) to construct and validate OCS and SCS scales, (b) to determine the relationships between OCS and SCS and between each scale and professional/family characteristics, and (c) to compare these associations between male and female family physicians (FPs). The study sample comprised 250 female and 250 male FPs from urban health centers in Andalusia (Spain). Data were gathered over 6 months on gender, age, care load, professional/family variables, and family-work balance, using a self-administered questionnaire.

"Knowledge translation in Africa for 21st century integrative biology: the ""know-do gap"" in family planning with contraceptive use among Somali women.",Ahmed AA; Mohamed AA; Guled IA; Elamin HM; Abou-Zeid AH,"An emerging dimension of 21(st) century integrative biology is knowledge translation in global health. The maternal mortality rate in Somalia is amongst the highest in the world. We set out to study the ""know-do"" gap in family planning measures in Somalia, with a view to inform future interventions for knowledge integration between theory and practice. We interviewed 360 Somali females of reproductive age and compared university-educated females to women with less or no education, using structured interviews, with a validated questionnaire. The mean age of marriage was 18 years, with 4.5 pregnancies per marriage. The mean for the desired family size was 9.3 and 10.5 children for the university-educated group and the less-educated group, respectively. Importantly, nearly 90% of the university-educated group knew about family planning, compared to 45.6% of the less-educated group. All of the less-educated group indicated that they would never use contraceptives, as compared to 43.5% of the university-educated group. Prevalence of contraceptive use among ever-married women was 4.3%. In the less-educated group, 80.6% indicated that they would not recommend contraceptives to other women as compared to 66.0% of the university-educated group. There is a huge gap between knowledge and practice regarding family planning in Somalia. The attendant reasons for this gap, such as level of education, expressed personal religious beliefs and others, are examined here. For primary health care to gain traction in Africa, we need to address the existing ""know-do"" gaps that are endemic and adversely impacting on global health. This is the first independent research study examining the knowledge gaps for family planning in Somalia in the last 20 years, with a view to understanding knowledge integration in a global world.

Is medical school culture conducive to women's academic success? a survey on faculty perceptions and experiences of gender equity,Shorey S.; ; Gan Y.-H.; Cavert M.S.; Archuleta S.,"BACKGROUND: In academic medicine, the lack of gender equity hinders the career progression of women academics. This can often affect scientific productivity and widen the gender gap that exists in this field. As such, this study aimed to understand how full-time faculty members in academic medicine perceive the climate for women academics and identify target areas for interventions supporting gender equity. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): This study adopted an embedded mixed-methods design. Data collection was done from November 2022 to January 2023, at the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Medicine. The participants comprised academic clinicians and non-clinician faculty members who were either currently employed full-time at the NUS School of Medicine or had recently resigned. They completed an adapted version of the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS) questionnaire, which assessed their perceptions of the faculty climate across four domains: equal access, work-life balance, freedom from gender bias, and supportive leadership. Quantitative findings were complemented by qualitative data gathered through open-ended survey questions. ANOVA and t-test were used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Compared to female participants (M = 140.0, SD = 57.9), male participants perceived greater gender equity (M = 158.7, SD = 62.9). Personal experiences of gender inequity were described by some female participants. Participants also raised various suggestions to improve work-life balance for both male and female faculty members, mitigate structural gender bias and increasing support for women faculty. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Female faculty members tend to have a less favourable view of the working climate for women in academic medicine, compared to their male counterparts. This might be attributed to differences in awareness of gender inequity and understanding of gender bias. Findings of this study provided further insight into the perceptions of faculty members regarding workplace gender equity and interventions that can be implemented to support them in their career.

First, the nature of institutionally recognized leadership positions was largely perceived as bureaucratic and disciplinary, which did not appeal to most participants. Second, women engaged in leadership roles that increased practice efficiency, improved working conditions, and added to their emotional labor-without remuneration. Third, women experienced a tension between work and family, but this did not impact their long-term career goals-which remained focused on patient care or lower-level leadership positions. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Increasing the number of women in leadership positions can be achieved through innovative leadership models that prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and work-life balance.

Genetic and Environmental Influences on Perceived Stress in South Korean Twins,Jo G.; ; Hur Y.-M.,"Researchers have proposed that culture significantly influences perceived stress (PS). To date, however, twin studies on PS have been conducted mostly in western, individualistic cultures, which demonstrate that PS due to controllable (personal) life events is more heritable than PS due to uncontrollable (network) life events. This study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental influences on PS in South Korean twins. South Korea practices a dominant collectivist culture. In total, 1372 twin individuals (mean age = 22.4 +/- 2.5 years) completed an online survey on PS, which consisted of the scales, Friendship, Academic Stress, Future Career, Family Conflicts, and Family Financial Difficulties (FFD). Friendship, Academic Stress, and Future Career can be considered PS due to personal life events, and Family Conflict and FFD, PS due to network life events. The general sex-limitation model-fitting analysis revealed the absence of qualitative or quantitative sex differences in genetic and environmental influences. Specifically, additive genetic influences were predominant for Friendship (63%), Academic Stress (67%), and Future Career (57%) for both sexes, with the remaining variance attributable to nonshared environmental influences. In contrast, shared environmental influences were largest for Family Conflict (47% for both genders) and FFD (64% for males, 63% for females) with no significant genetic effects. Despite known cultural differences in the means and variances of PS, South Korean twins exhibited significant genetic effects in PS due to personal life events and large shared environmental effects in PS due to network life events, which is similar to western samples.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s), 2024.",2024,/,Twin Research and Human Genetics,27,3,163EP  - 168,2032061316,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/thg.2024.21,38699817,#67,Jo 2024,"",""
How Early Career Family Medicine Women Physicians Negotiate Their First Job After Residency,Koempel A.; ; Filippi M.K.; Byrd M.; Bazemore E.; Siddiqi A.; Jabbarpour Y.,"Background: Nested within a growing body of evidence of a gender pay gap in medicine are more alarming recent findings from family medicine: a gender pay gap of 16% can be detected at a very early career stage. This article explores qualitative evidence of women's experiences negotiating for their first job out of residency to ascertain women's engagement with and approach to the negotiation process. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We recruited family physicians who graduated residency in 2019 and responded to the American Board of Family Medicine 2022 graduate survey. We developed a semistructured interview guide following a modified life history approach to uncover women's experiences through the transitory stages from residency to workforce. A qualitative researcher used Zoom to interview 19 geographically and racially diverse early career women physicians. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo software following an Inductive Content Analysis approach. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Three main themes emerged from the data. First, salary was found to be nonnegotiable, exemplified by participants' inability to change initial salary offers. Second, the role of peer support throughout residency and early career was crucial to uncovering and rectifying salary inequity. Third, a pay expectation gap was identified among women from minority and low-income households. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): To rectify the gender pay gap in medicine, a systems-level approach is required. This can be achieved through various levels of interventions: societally expanding the use of and removing the stigma around parental leave, recognizing the importance of contributions not currently valued by productivity-based payment models, examining assumptions about leadership; and institutionally moving away from fee-for-service systems, encouraging flexible schedules, increasing salary transparency, and improving advancement transparency.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American Board of Family Medicine.

A Shadow of Doubt: Is There Implicit Bias among Orthopaedic Surgery Faculty and Residents Regarding Race and Gender?,Gilbert S.R.; ; Torrez T.; Jardaly A.H.; Templeton K.J.; Ode G.E.; Coe K.; Patt J.C.; Schenker M.L.; McGwin G.; Ponce B.A.,"BackgroundOrthopaedic surgery continues to be one of the least diverse medical specialties. Recently, increasing emphasis has been placed on improving diversity in the medical field, which includes the need to better understand existing biases. Despite this, only about 6% of orthopaedic surgeons are women and 0.3% are Black. Addressing diversity, in part, requires a better understanding of existing biases. Most universities and residency programs have statements and policies against discrimination that seek to eliminate explicit biases. However, unconscious biases might negatively impact the selection, training, and career advancement of women and minorities who are underrepresented in orthopaedic surgery. Although this is difficult to measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) by Project Implicit might be useful to identify and measure levels of unconscious bias among orthopaedic surgeons, providing opportunities for additional interventions to improve diversity in this field.Questions/purposes(1) Do orthopaedic surgeons demonstrate implicit biases related to race and gender roles? (2) Are certain demographic characteristics (age, gender, race or ethnicity, or geographic location) or program characteristics (geographic location or size of program) associated with the presence of implicit biases? (3) Do the implicit biases of orthopaedic surgeons differ from those of other healthcare providers or the general population?MethodsA cross-sectional study of implicit bias among orthopaedic surgeons was performed using the IAT from Project Implicit. The IAT is a computerized test that measures the time required to associate words or pictures with attributes, with faster or slower response times suggesting the ease or difficulty of associating the items. Although concerns have been raised recently about the validity and utility of the IAT, we believed it was the right study instrument to help identify the slight hesitation that can imply differences between inclusion and exclusion of a person. We used two IATs, one for Black and White race and one for gender, career, and family roles. We invited a consortium of researchers from United States and Canadian orthopaedic residency programs. Researchers at 34 programs agreed to distribute the invitation via email to their faculty, residents, and fellows for a total of 1484 invitees. Twenty-eight percent (419) of orthopaedic surgeons and trainees completed the survey. The respondents were 45% (186) residents, 55% (228) faculty, and one fellow. To evaluate response biases, the respondent population was compared with that of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons census. Responses were reported as D-scores based on response times for associations. D-scores were categorized as showing strong (>= 0.65), moderate (>= 0.35 to < 0.65), or slight (>= 0.15 to < 0.35) associations. For a frame of reference, orthopaedic surgeons' mean IAT scores were compared with historical scores of other self-identified healthcare providers and that of the general population. Mean D-scores were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether demographic characteristics were associated with differences in D-scores. Bonferroni correction was applied, and p values less than 0.0056 were considered statistically significant.ResultsOverall, the mean IAT D-scores of orthopaedic surgeons indicated a slight preference for White people (0.29 +/- 0.4) and a slight association of men with career (0.24 +/- 0.3), with a normal distribution. Hence, most respondents' scores indicated slight preferences, but strong preferences for White race were noted in 27% (112 of 419) of respondents. There was a strong association of women with family and home and an association of men with work or career in 14% (60 of 419). These preferences generally did not correlate with the demographic, geographic, and program variables that were analyzed, except for a stronger association of women with family and home among women respondents. There were no differences in race IAT D-scores between orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare providers and the general population. Gender-career IAT D-scores associating women with family and home were slightly lower among orthopaedic surgeons (0.24 +/- 0.3) than among the general population (0.32 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001) and other healthcare professionals (0.34 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). All of these values are in the slight preference range.ConclusionOrthopaedic surgeons demonstrated slight preferences for White people, and there was a tendency to associate women with career and family on IATs, regardless of demographic and program characteristics, similar to others in healthcare and the general population. Given the similarity of scores with those in other, more diverse areas of medicine, unconscious biases alone do not explain the relative lack of diversity in orthopaedic surgery.Clinical RelevanceImplicit biases only explain a small portion of the lack of progress in improving diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in our workforce and resolving healthcare disparities. Other causes including explicit biases, an unwelcoming culture, and perceptions of our specialty should be examined. Remedies including engagement of students and mentorship throughout training and early career should be sought.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

Long-term trends in the work hours of physicians in Canada,Kralj B.; ; Islam R.; Sweetman A.,"Background: Physician work hours directly influence patient access to health care services and play a vital role in physician human resource planning. We sought to evaluate longterm trends in hours worked by physicians in Canada, overall and by subgroup. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey to identify physicians via occupation and industry coding information. We estimated descriptive statistics and performed graphical analysis of the average weekly hours worked by physicians over the 1987-2021 period. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Overall, weekly physician work hours remained stable from 1987 until 1997, after which they declined. Average weekly hours decreased by 6.9 hours (p < 0.001), from 52.8 in 1987-1991 to 45.9 in 2017-2021. Among male physicians, work hours declined notably after 1997, while those of female physicians remained relatively stable at around 45 per week. Hours worked by married physicians declined significantly, amounting to 7.4 fewer hours per week (p = 0.001). In contrast, unmarried physicians displayed a statistically insignificant decline of 2.2 hours (p = 0.3). The COVID19 pandemic was associated with a sharp but brief disruption in weekly hours; by the end of 2020, physicians' work hours had returned to prepandemic levels. <ovid:br/>Interpretation(s): These findings may indicate a longterm shift in work preferences among Canadian physicians; male physicians may be seeking a better work-life balance, which, in turn, has narrowed the gap in hours worked by sex, with potential implications for pay equity. Policymakers and planners should carefully consider changes in hours worked, rather than just the total number of physicians, to ensure an accurate evaluation of the physician workforce.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.",2024,/,CMAJ.

Perceived Barriers to Pursuing a Career in Neurosurgery in Nigeria: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Nigerian Medical Students and Unspecialized Physicians,Odonkor M.N.; ; Dada O.E.; Rincon-Torroella J.; Pahwa B.; Balogun J.A.; Ukachukwu A.-E.K.; Fuller A.T.; Huang J.; Groves M.; Badejo O.A.; Abu-Bonsrah N.,"Background: Nigeria has an inadequate number of neurosurgeons to meet the population's demand for neurosurgical care. Furthermore, few Nigerian neurosurgeons are female. This study sought to evaluate perceived barriers to pursuing neurosurgery among Nigerian trainees. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A 60-question survey was distributed electronically to medical students at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, and unspecialized intern physicians at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.

A greater proportion of males indicated an interest in neurosurgery than females (40% vs. 18%, P = 0.010). Over 75% of respondents identified decreased family and personal time, long work hours, and limited access to maternity or paternity leave as potential barriers to neurosurgery, with no differences by gender. Respondents overall saw being female and low-income as disadvantageous to pursuing neurosurgery in Nigeria. Although they universally viewed research as important in neurosurgery, 59% of respondents reported inadequate access to research opportunities; this did not vary by gender.

Do you want to be a urologist? Gender differences for medical student perception of urology: A prospective survey study,Chung D.; ; Dua S.; Morra M.; Sidhom K.; Jain K.; Hosier G.,"Introduction: Gender inequality has been prevalent in the history of medicine, specifically within surgical specialties. Though there have been advances, urology has remained overwhelmingly male-dominant, with slow growth in female recruitment. This survey study evaluated whether gender-related differences in the perception of urology are present among future applicants that could account for gender disparity seen in recruitment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An anonymized, online survey was distributed to medical students enrolled at the Max Rady College of Medicine during the 2022-2023 semester. Attracting and deterring survey statements were created using current literature to guide topics of interest. Participants rated each statement using a five-point Likert scale with optional supplemental qualitative responses. Likert ratings were compared using a Mann-U-Whitney calculation between self-identifying male and female participants. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We received 90 responses over six weeks, achieving a response rate of 23%. Female students, compared to their male peers, were deterred by factors such as working in a male-dominated specialty (p<0.001) and working with primarily male patients (p<0.001). There were no significant gender-related differences for statements pertaining to interest in surgery, work-life balance, or exposure to urology. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this survey study, the biggest deterrents reported by female medical students to entering urology were working in a male-dominated profession and seeing primarily male patients.

Factors associated with work ability among employees of an Italian university hospital,Casolari L.; ; Curzi Y.; Mastroberardino M.; Pistoresi B.; Poma E.; Broccoli L.; Fabbri T.,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence clearly documents the benefits of integrated systems approaches to protecting and promoting the safety, health and well-being of workers. The purpose of this study is to provide a holistic view of the work ability of employees of an Italian University Hospital measuring their resources in relation to job demands. In particular, it examines socio-demographics, family and organizational antecedents of health professionals' work ability. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A survey was conducted to assess the work ability of healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses and administrative staff, working at the University Hospital of Modena (Italy). The data collection allows us to get a sample of 443 workers, who correspond to 11% of the target population. The data were analyzed using preliminary statistics on the main characteristics of the sample in terms of work ability, socio-demographic variables, family and organizational characteristics. In addition, logit models of the likelihood of having high work ability were estimated using SPSS version 25. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Work ability decreases with increasing age, comorbidity, high body mass index, having at least one child under 5 and/or a dependent adult, having a poor work-life balance, and doing more than 20 h of housework. Specific job resources can significantly promote work ability, including relationship-oriented leadership, autonomy in decision making and individuals' skill match. The nursing profession is associated with a low work ability. Finally, a significant gender gap has been documented. Women find it more difficult to reconcile life and work, especially when they have children of preschool age and work in professions with greater responsibilities, as in the case of women doctors, who experience lower work capacity. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that it is necessary to consider other factors, in addition to age, that are equally relevant in influencing work ability. Consequently, organisational interventions could be implemented to improve the work ability of all workers. In addition, we propose targeted interventions for groups at risk of reduced work capacity, in particular older workers (45 years and over), nurses, women with children of preschool age and in the position of physician.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

"""I am the doctor"": gender-based bias within the clinical practice of emergency medicine in Canada-a thematic analysis of physician and trainee interview data",Jagelaviciute G.; ; Bouwsema M.; Walker M.; Steer M.; Dagnone D.; Brennan E.,"Objectives: While women comprise about half of current Canadian medical students and physicians, only 31% of emergency medicine physicians identify as women and women trainees are less likely to express interest in emergency medicine compared to men. Gender-based bias continues to negatively impact the career choice, progress, and well-being of women physicians/trainees. Although instances of gender-based bias are well documented within other medical specialties, there remains a gap in the literature addressing the role of gender specific to the Canadian emergency medicine clinical environment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Using a qualitative study with a thematic analytical approach, participants were purposively and snowball sampled from a cross-section of centers across Canada and included emergency medicine attending physicians and trainees. A thematic analysis using an inductive and deductive approach was undertaken. All data were double coded to improve study trustworthiness. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty-four individuals (17 woman-identifying and 17 man-identifying) from 10 different institutions across 4 provinces in Canada participated in the study. Six themes were identified: (1) women experience gender bias in the form of microaggressions; (2) women experience imposter syndrome and question their role in the clinical setting; (3) more women provide patient care to women patients and vulnerable populations; (4) gender-related challenges with family planning and home responsibilities affect work-life balance; (5) allyship and sponsorship are important for the support and development of women physicians and trainees; and (6) women value discussing shared experiences with other women to debrief situations, find mentorship, and share advice. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Gender inequity in emergency medicine affects women-identifying providers at all levels of training across Canada. Described experiences support several avenues to implement change against perceived gender bias that is focused on education, policy, and supportive spaces.

Work-Life Integration for Women in Pediatric Emergency Medicine: Themes Identified Through Group Level Assessment,Skotnicki B.S.; ; Wilson P.M.; Kazmerski T.M.; Prideaux J.; Manole M.D.; Kinnane J.M.; Lunoe M.M.,"Objective Women in medicine generally have higher burnout and lower career satisfaction and work-life integration compared with men. This study identifies factors that contribute to burnout, career satisfaction, and work-life integration in women pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians. Methods Self-identified women PEM physicians in the United States participated in a virtual focus group using Group Level Assessment methodology. Participants completed Group Level Assessment process steps of climate setting, generating, appreciating, reflecting, understanding, selecting, and action to (1) identify themes that contribute to burnout, career satisfaction, and work-life integration and (2) determine actionable factors based on these themes. Data were collected and thematically analyzed in real time through iterative processing. The group prioritized identified themes through rounds of distillation. Results Seventeen women participated, representing 10 institutions (ages 30s-70s, 69% employed full-time). Participants identified 3 main themes contributing to burnout, career satisfaction, and work-life integration: (1) gender inequities, (2) supportive leadership, and (3) balance with family life. Actionable items identified were as follows: (1) development of initiatives to equalize pay, opportunity, and career advancement among genders; (2) implementation of an institutional focus on supportive and collaborative leadership; and (3) improvement of resources and supports for physicians with family responsibilities. Conclusions Women PEM physicians identified gender inequities, leadership, and balance with family life as major themes affecting their burnout, career satisfaction, and work-life integration.

A Coaching-Based Leadership Program for Women Postdoctoral Fellows at the National Cancer Institute that Cultivates Self-confidence and Persistence in STEMM,Sutton S.; ; Palmisano A.; Ginsburg E.,"Despite making strides in gender equality, women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) continue to face a persistent underrepresentation in leadership roles. In an effort to reverse this trend, the National Cancer Institute created the Sallie Rosen Kaplan (SRK) Postdoctoral Fellowship, a year-long coaching-based leadership training program. The SRK program aims to empower women to explore careers across a broad range of fields, including academia, industry, and government, and to excel in leadership positions in those fields. Analyzing a decade of data from 111 participants, we describe the positive impact of the SRK program on participant's self-reported capabilities. Increased self-confidence, improved time management and work/life balance, enhanced goal-setting and attainment skills, and strengthened communication and relationship-building abilities are highlighted as statistically significant outcomes. Moreover, the program's emphasis on coaching, mentorship, peer cohort support, and building lasting professional relationships also contributed to high ratings for satisfaction and value of the program.

PRACTICE APPROACHES AMONG CANADIAN OPHTHALMOLOGISTS,Parvand M.; ; Doughty N.; Jaffer A.; Sanders E.; Kherani F.,"Introduction Although there has been a trend towards gender balance in ophthalmology, this has not yet translated into equal representation in leadership roles. Aims We aimed to assess the current practice patterns of ophthalmology in Canada by analysing gender disparities in leadership and identifying barriers to leadership advancement. Methods A listing of all ophthalmologists registered with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 2019 was used as the sample population. A listserv was created by searching public websites and email invitations to participate in a survey was forwarded. Results Out of 117 participants, 38 (32.8%) were female, with an average age of 49 years compared to 57 years for males. Female practitioners had 16.9 years of practice on average, while males had 25.6 years (P<0.001). Fellowship numbers were similar for both genders (P=0.39), but females leaned towards neuro-ophthalmology, while males favored retina. Thirteen females (34.2%) and nine males (11.5%) held graduate degrees (P=0.005). Practice settings showed no significant gender difference, whether hospital-based or private clinics (P>0.05). Fewer females held academic appointments (55.2% vs. 84.6%, P=0.001), especially full/associate professorships (18.4% vs. 41.0%, P=0.02). Assistant professorships were comparable (26.3% vs. 37.2%, P=0.29). Both genders faced similar career advancement challenges, including work-life balance, support, and time constraints.

IMPACT OF GENDER DISPARITIES IN CORE PROCEDURAL COMPETENCIES IN PRE-FELLOWSHIP TRAINEES,Vasti E.; ; Parks M.; Holmes A.A.; Delgado-Carrasco K.; Nallamshetty S.; Rogers A.; Jonas A.,"Background Women in cardiology remain underrepresented, accounting for 21% of all general cardiology fellows. These disparities are exacerbated in procedural subspecialties, such as interventional cardiology and electrophysiology. Although factors such as work/life balance have been implicated, the influence of core competencies on training opportunities across gender has not been described. The Core Cardiovascular Training Statement (COCATS) emphasizes proficiency in performing key procedures, such as venous and arterial access, but substantial heterogeneity in these procedures exists in internal medicine training. Limited data exist on gender disparities in pre-fellowship training. Understanding overlapping procedural skillsets that translate from internal medicine to cardiology may impact future sub-specialization in cardiology. Methods We performed an explanatory retrospective cohort study of procedures performed and supervised by from 2015-2019 at an academic internal medicine residency program. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for graduation year, gender, and future fellowship subspecialty plan (procedural vs non-procedural). Results Between 2015 and 2019, 164 residents completed a total of 6,055 bedside procedures. Of these, arterial and venous access accounted for 22% and 20% of total procedures. After adjustment for planned procedural subspecialty, female residents completed an average of 25% fewer total procedures than male colleagues (p=0.003, 95% CI: -16.61 to -3.36). Female residents performed an average per resident of 34% and 33% fewer venous and arterial access procedures, respectively, compared to their male colleagues. Conclusion Even after accounting for procedural career plan, such as cardiology, women residents performed 25% fewer procedures than their male colleagues and these results were accentuated in cardiology competency areas, such as venous and arterial access. These findings highlight the need for reassessment of core competencies that span the transition from internal medicine to cardiology to improve gender disparities in procedural training.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation",2024,/,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,83,13 Supplement,2354,2031122744,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0735-1097%2824%2904344-4,,#81,Vasti 2024,"",""

This study explores the feasibility of longitudinally tracking a well-being score for physicians in training at the Geneva University Hospitals - Division of Primary Care Medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Between September 2021 and November 2022, all physicians in training in this division were invited to complete online questionnaires: on arrival, at the end of each semester, and at the end of their training. The main tool was the ""Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index"" (PFI)#sup#3#/sup# which measures two Results: This study included 682 physicians, 278 (41%) men and 404 (59%) women aged 37+/-11 years (mean +/- standard deviation). Among respondents, 38% worked in university hospitals, 39% in other hospitals and 19% in private practice. Overall, a desire to quit their job was prevalent in 33% of respondents of either sex. Lack of the following workplace-related factors was associated with the desire to quit work in both sexes: having a good network, mentoring or supervisor's support, satisfaction with autonomy at work, workplace inclusiveness and a good work-life balance. Furthermore, perceived gender-related discrimination at work was associated with wanting to quit work. Sex differences existed in the following workplace factors: Men active in medical education and women active in research were less likely to want to quit work. Among personal factors, a pathological Physician Well-being index was associated with wanting to quit work in both sexes. A sex difference among personal factors was that men (but not women) who reported to have no adequate childcare were more likely to desire quitting work compared to those who reported to have adequate childcare. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This study identified several potentially reversible factors associated with a tendency to consider quitting a physician job.

Women hold only 30% of professor positions at state medical universities in Austria and only 11.9% of all chief physicians are female. Motherhood and related absence is the main career obstacle, but gender bias and missing role models are also factors hindering women to thrive. Improved working conditions would be beneficial for all members of the medical profession. Future generations (Generation Y, Generation Z) will likely expedite changes toward a better work-life balance and claim the right to find fulfillment besides work.

Total 70.4% of faculty had caregiver responsibilities and 64.3% reported other individual stresses (e.g., financial, family/social, health-related), which required consistent demand of time and effort. A total of 35.7% of faculty reported not being able to balance competing life and work demands. A total of 21.4% respondents reported not utilizing any individual healthy lifestyle choices on a consistent basis over the prior 12 months. Protected time off work and remote work were perceived as effective strategies to provide adequate work-life balance; however, remote work engagement was relatively minor and 35.7% bought back vacation. Total 53.6% respondents reported a level 4 (out of 5) rating for work being meaningful and being positively engaged in their work. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Institutions should invest in providing the infrastructure for physician work-life balance and in facilitating healthy lifestyle choices for physicians.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 The Association of University Radiologists",2023,/,Academic Radiology,30,4,579EP  - 584,2022693508,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2023.01.011,36775667,#85,Cankurtaran 2023,"",""
The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on STEM faculty: Productivity and work-life balance,Esquivel A.; ; Marincean S.; Benore M.,"The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted STEM professionals in numerous ways, affecting research, teaching, publications, patents, and work-life balance.

"Women in Allergy and Immunology: The Future Is Female, Let Us Soar!",Blumenthal K.G.; ; Bansal P.; Youssef C.M.; Pappalardo A.A.,"Despite increases in the number of female physicians in the past 50 years, women remain underrepresented in key areas of medicine, such as practice owners and partners, professional society leaders, principal investigators, full professors, chairs, and deans. Women are paid less, oftentimes for more work. Allergy and Immunology (AI), as a specialty, lacks substantial workforce research, but trends across specialties are consistent. We review what is currently known about women in AI and consider barriers to practice, advancement, and contribution. Through a new inquiry, we find that the challenges women in AI encounter can be summarized through 6 themes: work-life balance, professional advancement, salary equity, mentorship and sponsorship, bias, and sexual harassment and misconduct. Together, we must address these challenges head-on and provide an equitable environment for women in AI to thrive, especially those affected by intersectionality. To do so, we suggest targeted, tangible actions to promote opportunities, offer institutional support, and advance reporting and culture change outlets across AI settings.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",2023,/,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice,11,12,3569EP  - 3577,2025404737,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2023.06.010,37315689,#87,Blumenthal 2023,"",""
Women physicians and the COVID-19 pandemic: gender-based impacts and potential interventions,Ranasinghe P.D.; ; Zhou A.,"Aim: These are extraordinary times caused by the first global pandemic in our modern era. Physicians and other frontline healthcare providers face unique challenges, for which they have had little formal preparation. This combination of challenge and deficit leads to significant negative impacts, not only on what medical practices and health care systems can deliver to the public, but also on the individual healthcare providers themselves. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this essay, we specifically address women physicians, and explore the considerable impact they bear from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the contexts of response to stress, social isolation, work-life integration, and autonomy. Because the language we use is important, we think it necessary to clarify that when we refer to 'women physicians,' we are referring to physicians that self-identify as women, and we acknowledge that not all the references we cite may use the same definition. <ovid:br/>Result(s): We offer several potential interventions that turn the challenges women physicians are facing into opportunities to address longstanding inequity. These interventions include tackling barriers to work-life balance, addressing gender and maternal bias, and promoting women physician representation in leadership. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to become a chronic part of our lives; protecting vulnerable populations, such as women physicians, through thoughtful intervention is paramount.KEY MESSAGES Women physicians experience considerable adversity during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the contexts of response to stress, social isolation, work-life integration, and autonomy.

Medical Students' Perceptions of Orthopedics as a Career for Women,Crawford A.E.; ; Burge K.G.; Yazdi A.A.; Coffin M.D.; Collins C.S.; Dib A.G.; Gould S.J.,"Objectives To determine potential factors influencing female medical students' interest and subsequent application to orthopedics, and to evaluate female and male medical students' perceptions of women in the field of orthopedics. Methods An institutional review board-approved survey was distributed in March 2020 and subsequently in April 2022 to medical students in the classes of 2023 and 2024 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture. An e-mail link to the REDCap survey was sent to students across the southeast region of the United States, followed by three reminder e-mails. All 25 allopathic medical schools in the southeastern United States with an Orthopedics Interest Group listed on their institution's Web site were invited to participate in the study. Nine Orthopedics Interest Group leaders interested in participating were asked to provide the researchers with a list of fourth-year medical students who attended an event hosted by that group (215). A total of 39 respondents who completed the survey were included in this study. Results Overall, the majority of students (n = 35, 90%) believed that women faced more barriers to a career in orthopedics than did men. The most significant barriers to women entering the field of orthopedics were the perceived expectations of an orthopedic surgeon (n = 34, 87%), difficulty balancing career and family (n = 28, 72%), and demanding schedule (n = 13, 33%). Conclusions This study demonstrates that both male and female medical students believe there are significant additional barriers to success for women in the field. Study participants report that expectations set by physicians, other healthcare professionals, and patients contribute to creating greater barriers that deter medical students interested in orthopedics from ultimately applying to the specialty.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2023,/,Southern Medical Journal,116,7,545EP  - 550,2025385921,https://dx.doi.org/10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001577,37400100,#89,Crawford 2023,"",""
Status of Women in Neurosurgery: Results from a National Survey in Italy,Scerrati A.; ; Angelini C.; Madoglio A.; Lucidi D.; Parini S.; Verdi D.; Gumbs A.A.; Spolverato G.,"Background: Gender inequity in surgery has increasingly been a matter of debate. Contributions of female neurosurgeons to academic medicine and societies are poorly highlighted. The aim of this study was to evaluate several aspects of the professional and work-life balance of female neurosurgeons in Italy. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Data of the female neurosurgical population were extracted from a general 83-item questionnaire administered to a total of 3242 respondents. The survey was composed of multiple-choice questions investigating demographics, surgical training and practice, satisfaction, mentorship, discrimination, and harassment. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 98 female neurosurgeons were included. Most responders were married or cohabiting (49%). Thirty-nine (43%) were planning to have children, and 15 of them (44%) stated the reason they still didn't have any was because of professional constraints. Seventy (71%) women were neurosurgeons with an academic position (residents or academics) and 28 (29%) were full-time attendings. Most of the female neurosurgeons are satisfied with their work: sometimes (35%), often (20%), and always or almost always (20%). Most of them (45%) stated they are rarely victims of harassment, but 66% think that they are treated differently because they are women. A similar rate for a poor and fulfilling work-life balance (34% and 35%, respectively) was detected. The majority of participants (89%) had encountered a role model during their career, but in only 11% of cases was that person female. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Even though the rate of satisfaction among female neurosurgeons in Italy is high, some of them experienced gender discrimination, including incidents of sexual harassment and microaggressions. Policies including job sharing paradigms, consistent and meaningful options for parental leave, mentorship programs, equal and fair remuneration for equal work, and zero tolerance for harassment should be encouraged.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s)",2023,/,World Neurosurgery: X,18,"(Scerrati, Angelini, Madoglio) Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy(Scerrati, Angelini, Madoglio) Department of Neurosurgery, Sant' Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy(Lucidi) Department o",100149,2021074036,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wnsx.2022.100149,,#90,Scerrati 2023,"",""

The Experiences of Motherhood in Female Surgeons: A Scoping Review,Mavedatnia D.; ; Ardestani S.; Zahabi S.; Neocleous P.; Madou E.; Dzioba A.; Strychowsky J.E.; Elise Graham M.,"Objective: The objective of this study is to systematically synthesize the existing literature on the experiences of motherhood in female surgeons both during surgical training and as staff physicians, to identify knowledge gaps, and to provide recommendations for institutional changes to better support pregnant female surgeons. <ovid:br/>Background(s): There are disproportionately fewer medical students pursuing surgical specialties, as surgery is often seen as incompatible with childbearing and pregnancy. However, no review has summarized the published literature on the collective experiences of female surgeons in navigating motherhood. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Four databases were searched and 1106 abstracts were identified. Forty-two studies were included and a thematic analysis was performed. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Four themes were identified: path toward motherhood (n=18), realities of motherhood (n=25), medical culture and its impact on career and family life (n=24), and institutional reproductive wellness policies (n=21). Female surgeons are more likely to delay motherhood until after training and have high rates of assisted reproductive technology use. Pregnancy during surgical training is associated with negative perception from peers, pregnancy complications, and scheduling challenges. Maternity leave policies and breastfeeding and childcare facilities are variable and often inadequate. Many female surgeons would agree that greater institutional support would help support women in both their roles as mothers and as surgeons. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Both female residents and staff surgeons experience significant and unique barriers before, during, and after motherhood that impact their personal and professional lives.

Are We There Yet? No. Gender Disparities Still Exist and Affect Surgeon Burnout,Lake Z.; ; Dunford G.; Hunter J.; Berry S.,"Purpose of Review: Women represent almost half of all practicing surgeons in the USA; however, women continue to struggle with achieving equity in compensation, recruitment, promotion, and work-life balance. A review of recent literature about gender disparities in medicine, with focus on trauma surgery, was performed to better understand the issues and seek solutions. Recent Findings: Burnout affects patient care and physician well-being which results in increased health care costs, physician turnover as well as increased reports of PTSD and suicidal ideation among physicians. Job satisfaction and control over schedule are identified as significant contributors to burnout whereas workplace structures engrained with gender discrimination are major barriers to promotion. <ovid:br/>Summary: This review highlights that female physicians, particularly surgeons, are disproportionally affected by burnout when compared to their male colleagues.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A SHARED MENTAL MODEL FOR SUPPORT OF FACULTY, STAFF, AND TRAINEES WITH FAMILIES IN A DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE",Harper W.; ; Barros L.M.; Vig E.K.; Caldwell S.; Clodfelter R.; Merel S.E.,"BACKGROUND: Working caregivers in medicine balance the needs of their families, patients, and other responsibilities with limited resources. The context and climate of academic medicine reinforce gender inequities and lead to increased burnout, gender pay inequities, and decreased opportunities for career advancement for working caregivers. Stressors associated with work-life integration are highest in women with children and have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought the perspectives of faculty and staff to understand the barriers to supporting employees with families and to explore what an ideal model of support for faculty, staff and trainees with families might look like. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We conducted five focus group interviews by videoconference in an academic medical center in the Northwest Region.

Early-Career Compensation Trends Among Family Physicians,Sanders K.; ; Phillips J.; Fleischer S.; Peterson L.E.,"Purpose: Family medicine incomes are often cited as a key reason for shortages of family physicians. The purpose of this study was to identify family physician income trends and to test how income varies among early-career family physicians. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used data from the 2016 to 2020 American Board of Family Medicine National Graduate Survey (NGS) collected from early-career family physicians (n = 9566; response rate = 63.9%). The NGS asked practice income, practice activities, practice site, and setting. We performed an income trend analysis and conducted multivariate regression to test for associations of personal and workplace characteristics with income. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Average income across the full sample of early-career family physicians (after inflation adjustments) was $224,292. Overall, income growth outpaced inflation from 2016 to 2020. There are significant differences in income based on personal and work characteristics, and income growth varied dramatically. Notably, women respondents reported earnings of $33,522 below those of men respondents in adjusted models. In addition, the incomes of several groups lagged behind inflation, including those practicing geriatrics (-0.67%), employed by the Indian Health Service (-1.72%), and respondents who identified as Black or African American (-0.85%). Greatest increases in inflationadjusted incomes were observed among those in palliative care (4.61%) and at nonfederal government clinics (4.46%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Though income is only one factor physicians consider in deciding where and how to work, it is concerning to see lower incomes among groups that traditionally experience shortages (eg, geriatrics and government-associated practice sites).

The role of gender on the clinical practice of emergency medicine in Canada,Jagelaviciute G.; ; Bouwsema M.; Walker M.; Steer M.; Dagnone D.; Brennan E.,"Introduction: While women comprise about half of current Canadian medical students and physicians, only 31% of emergency medicine (EM) physicians identify as women. Gender-based bias and discrimination continues to have an impact in medicine and can affect the career choice, progress, and well-being of women trainees and physicians. Although instances of gender-based bias are well documented within other specialties in medicine, there remains a gap in literature addressing the role of gender specific to the Canadian EM clinical environment. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Participants were purposively and snowball sampled from a cross-section of urban, community, and rural centers across Canada. Interviews were conducted with 17 woman-identifying and 17 manidentifying emergency medicine attending physicians, residents, and clinical clerks. Data analysis utilized inductive and deductive approaches with thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke. Trustworthiness and credibility were ensured through strategies of reflexivity, triangulation, and appropriate intercoder reliability. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Analysis revealed six themes that describe the role of gender within EM clinical practice. First, women disproportionately experience gender bias in the form of microaggressions. Second, women are more likely to experience imposter syndrome and question their role in the clinical setting because of compounding experiences of gender bias. Third, women patients and vulnerable populations prefer women providers for sensitive aspects of patient care. Fourth, there are gender-related challenges with family planning and home responsibilities that affect work-life balance. Fifth, allyship and sponsorship are important for the support and development of women physicians and trainees. Sixth, women value discussing shared experiences with other women to debrief situations, find mentorship, and share advice. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that gender inequity is prominent within the EM clinical environment and disproportionately affects women providers. Through describing the experiences of providers across Canada we highlight several avenues to implement change. Avenues include gender equity training incorporated into simulation; bystander awareness workshops; standardized parental leave policies; and safe spaces for discussion, support, and sponsorship for all providers.

GENDER INFLUENCES ON TEAM WORK PERFORMANCE,Moka E.; ; Rekatsina M.; Siafaka I.; Vadalouka A.,"Gender influences on teamwork performance in the fields of anaesthesia and pain medicine, but also in scientific societies can be complex and multifaceted. While it is important to recognize that individual variations exist within genders, research has shown that gender can play a role in team dynamics and performance in these fields. A variety of factors that need to be considered have been identified across literature. Stereotypes and Bias Gender stereotypes and biases can affect team dynamics and performance. Stereotypes about gender roles and abilities may influence how team members perceive and evaluate each other's contributions. For example, unconscious biases may lead to women being perceived as less competent or authoritative, which can impact their ability to effectively contribute to team decisions and leadership roles. Communication Styles Men and women may have different communication styles, which can impact teamwork. Research suggests that women tend to use more collaborative and inclusive communication styles, while men may adopt more assertive and direct approaches. These differences can affect how individuals interact, contribute ideas, and make decisions within a team setting. Leadership Opportunities Gender disparities in leadership positions can affect teamwork dynamics. Scientific societies, anaesthesia departments and academic communities may have a higher proportion of male leaders, leading to potential imbalances in decision-making power and the allocation of resources. This can influence team dynamics and hinder equal participation and collaboration among team members. Implicit Biases and Perception of Expertise: Implicit biases can influence the perception of expertise and competence in team members. These biases may lead to women's contributions being undervalued or overlooked, even when they possess the necessary skills and knowledge. This can hinder team performance and create an unequal distribution of tasks and responsibilities. Work-life Balance and Career Advancement Gender-related challenges, such as managing work-life balance, can impact team performance. Women in scientific societies and anaesthesia communities may face additional pressures related to family responsibilities and societal expectations, which can affect their availability, participation, and career advancement opportunities. These challenges can impact teamwork dynamics and overall performance. Addressing gender influences on teamwork performance requires promoting gender equity, fostering inclusive team cultures, and challenging biases and stereotypes. Encouraging equal representation, providing leadership and mentorship opportunities, and promoting diversity and inclusivity initiatives can help mitigate these influences and create more effective and equitable teams. Additionally, awareness training and interventions aimed at reducing biases can support improved communication and collaboration among team members. In this context, a multi-faceted approach is required, with proposed strategies having the possibility to be implemented, as they are analyzed below. Promoting Diversity and Inclusivity Actively work towards creating diverse and inclusive teams by promoting equal opportunities for individuals of all genders. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment and hiring practices, ensuring diverse representation in leadership positions, and creating a supportive and inclusive work environment. Providing Training and Education Offer training programs and workshops that address unconscious biases, gender stereotypes, and communication styles. Provide education on the importance of inclusive teamwork and the value of diverse perspectives. This can help team members develop awareness and skills to mitigate biases and foster effective collaboration. Encouraging Mentorship and Sponsorship Establish mentorship and sponsorship programs that specifically support women in anaesthesia and scientific societies. Mentors can provide guidance, support, and advocacy to help women navigate career challenges and advancement opportunities. Sponsors can actively promote the visibility and recognition of talented individuals, helping to minimize gender biases in decision-making processes. Implementing Flexible Work Policies Support work-life balance by implementing flexible work policies that accommodate diverse needs. This includes providing options for parental leave, flexible working hours, and remote work arrangements. By reducing the impact of gender-related challenges on individuals' professional lives, team members can better contribute to and participate in teamwork. Fostering Inclusive Communication Encourage open and inclusive communication within teams. Promote equal participation and active listening, ensuring that everyone's perspectives are valued and considered. Create a culture where individuals feel comfortable expressing their ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of bias or judgment. Establishing clear evaluation criteria Develop clear and objective performance evaluation criteria that focus on skills, achievements, and contributions rather than gender. Train evaluators to be aware of potential biases and provide them with tools to make fair and unbiased assessments. Supporting Work-Life Integration Create a supportive environment that acknowledges and supports the integration of work and personal life responsibilities. Offer resources such as onsite childcare, family-friendly policies, and support networks to help individuals manage their professional and personal commitments effectively. Conducting Ongoing Research and Analysis Continuously monitor and analyze team performance, gender disparities, and barriers to inclusion. Collect data on team dynamics, leadership positions, and career advancement to identify areas for improvement and implement evidence-based strategies. It is essential to approach these strategies holistically and continuously evaluate their effectiveness. Creating a genderinclusive environment requires ongoing commitment, engagement, and a willingness to challenge and transform existing norms and biases.",2023,/,Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine,48,Supplement 1,A375EP  - A376,643992489,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2023-ESRA.683,,#101,Moka 2023,"",""
Diversity among endovascular neurointerventionalists in Canada results of a national survey 2022,Itsekzon-Hayosh Z.; ; Agid R.,"Aim: Neurointervention (NIR) is a relatively new developing filed of medicine. Diversity and inclusion in various medical fields has made a significant progress. However, many surgical and interventional fields are still lagging in this respect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of diversity and inclusion amongst neurointerventionalists in Canada. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): A survey was completed in June 2022 by each neurointerventional division in Canada. The survey included questions regarding demographics, inclusivity, diversity, social and personal parameters. The collected data was analysed using semi-quantitative analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): As of 2022, 85 physicians were actively practicing NIR in Canada. 52% were neuroradiologists, 38% neurosurgeons and 9% neurologists. 41% were immigrants to Canada (from 19 countries), for 35% English or French were not first language, 35% were visible minority. Women comprised only 21% of the practitioners, with comparable proportion of women in leadership positions. Most practitioners were in the 30-49 age group. 2.4% practitioners identified as LGBTQ. There was no gender difference in terms of life to work balance, with majority of practitioners being engaged in long term relationships and having children. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study shows encouraging results in terms of diversity and inclusion amongst Canadian neurointerventionalists regarding the representation of various specialty backgrounds, immigrants, and visible minorities. NIR centers are distributed according to population density and better coverage is needed in smaller communities and remote/isolated areas. Both women and men Canadian neurointerventionalists seem to have a favourable life-work balance. Gaps still exist regarding inclusion of first nations and women which are under-represented among Canadian Neurointerventionalists.

Winners and Losers in Academic Productivity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is the Gender Gap Widening for Faculty?,Ellinas E.H.; ; Ark T.K.; Kaljo K.; Quinn K.G.; Krier C.R.; Farkas A.H.,"Background: The coronavirus pandemic accelerated academic medicine into the frontline of research and clinical work, leaving some faculty exhausted, and others with unanticipated time off. Women were particularly vulnerable, having increased responsibilities in both academic work and caregiving. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The authors sought to determine faculty's responses to the pandemic, seeking predictors of accelerated versus decelerated academic productivity and work-life balance. In this survey of 424 faculty from a private Midwest academic medical center completed in August-September 2020, faculty rated multiple factors both ""pre-COVID""and ""during the COVID-19 lockdown,""and a change score was calculated. <ovid:br/>Result(s): In a binary logistic regression model comparing faculty whose self-rated academic productivity increased with those whose productivity decreased, the authors found that controlling for multiple factors, men were more than twice as likely to be in the accelerated productivity group as women. In a similar model comparing partnered faculty whose self-rated work-life balance increased with partnered faculty whose work-life balance decreased, being in the positive work-life balance group was predicted by increased academic productivity, increased job stress, and having higher job priority than your partner. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): While the COVID-19 pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty, pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty, some experienced gains in productivity and work-life balance, with potential to widen the gender gap. As academic medicine evolves post-COVID, leaders should be aware that productivity and work-life balance predict each other, and that these factors have connections to work location, stress, and relationship dynamics, emphasizing the inseparable connections between work and life success.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",2022,/,Journal of Women's Health,31,4,487EP  - 494,637897281,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0321,34935469,#103,Ellinas 2022,"",""
Knowledge of Fertility and Perspectives about Family Planning among Female Physicians,Smith K.S.; ; Bakkensen J.B.; Hutchinson A.P.; Cheung E.O.; Thomas J.; Grote V.; Moreno P.I.; Goldman K.N.; Jordan N.; Feinberg E.C.,"Importance: Pervasive gender disparities exist in medicine regarding promotion, achievement of academic rank, and appointment to leadership positions. Fertility and childbearing concerns may contribute to these disparities. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess fertility knowledge and concerns and evaluate barriers to family building and impact on academic attrition reported by female physicians. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This qualitative study used mixed methods; first, structured 1:1 interviews exploring fertility knowledge and family-building concerns were conducted among 16 female physicians between November 2019 and May 2020. Transcripts were coded in Dedoose and used to develop a survey instrument with subsequent pilot testing conducted among 24 female physicians between April 2020 and September 2020. Data analysis was performed from January 2021 to March 2021. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Fertility knowledge, perceptions of peer and institutional support surrounding childbearing, factors contributing to delayed childbearing, and impact of family planning on career decisions. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Among 16 women who completed qualitative interviews, 4 (25%) were Asian, 1 (6%) was Black, 1 (6%) was multiracial, and 10 (63%) were White; mean (SD) age was 34.9 (4.0) years. Evaluation of fertility knowledge revealed 3 notable themes: (1) inadequate formal fertility education, (2) informal learning through infertility experiences of patients, peers, or personal struggles, and (3) desire to improve medical education through early introduction and transparent discussions about infertility. Exploration of childbearing concerns similarly revealed several salient themes: (1) high incidence of delayed childbearing, (2) perceived lack of peer and administrative support, and (3) impact of family building on career trajectory. These themes were borne out in pilot testing of the survey instrument: of 24 female physicians (7 Asian women [27%], 1 Black woman [4%], 1 Hispanic or Latinx woman [4%], 1 multiracial woman [4%], 15 White women [58%]; mean [SD] age, 36.1 [6.7] years), 17 (71%) had delayed childbearing and 16 (67%) had altered their career for family-building reasons. <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: Qualitative interviews identified fertility and family building concerns among female physicians and were used to develop a tailored survey for women in medicine. These findings suggest that female physicians may delay childbearing and make substantial accommodations in their careers to support family building. A large-scale national survey is needed to better characterize the unique fertility, childbearing, and parenting needs of women in academic medicine to better understand how these concerns may contribute to academic attrition..<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Acoustical Society of America.

"Gender equity in emergency medicine: Five years on, where are we headed?",Govindasamy L.S.; ; Terziovski M.; Wheeler M.; Rixon A.; Wilson S.,"The challenge of addressing gender inequality was highlighted in the 2016 Trainee Focus of Emergency Medicine Australasia. Despite increasing numbers of female medical graduates, including increasing female trainees in emergency medicine (EM), this has not yet translated to equal representation in formal leadership roles. Five years later, as the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) welcomes the second female college president, this article explores the gendered leadership gap in EM from an organisational and intersectional feminist perspective and recommends high-level strategies for change. Notably, ACEM has demonstrated committed engagement with gender equity, such as the establishment of the Advancing Women in Emergency Section. It has also achieved gender parity in provisional trainees and improved women's representation on the ACEM Board. However, broader organisational processes that ensure work-life integration, transparent leadership development pathways and equitable recruitment, promotion, retention and evaluation remain critical.

STATUS FOR A FEMALE DOCTOR IN MODERN UROLOGY. THE RESULTS OF A WOMEN UROLOGISTS SURVEY IN RUSSIA,Sarukhanian A.L.; ; Faradzhullaeva V.R.; Karasev A.E.; Stroganov R.V.,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the role of women in medicine, particularly in surgical practice, has increasingly become a subject for discussion. Traditionally, male doctors have dominated in surgical specialties, especially in urology. Slow rhythm of changes in the structure of the specialty remains the problem relevant, despite the optimistic perspectives of the world urological community gender heterogeneity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have conducted an anonymous survey. Respondents were asked to complete a survey, which included questions from the survey of the European Association of Urology. The sample included 63 women, who were divided into two groups. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Despite the opinion of both groups about the lack of a separation into <<female>> and <<male>> specialties, there are concerns about a conflict with stereotypes and ideas about the impossibility of women working in a surgical specialty. Respondents of both groups had more than 70% assurance that in order to achieve professional success, a female surgeon needs more efforts than a male surgeon. In the question of the future status after 10 years, the student population in more than 60% noted the option <<operating urologist>> and less than 10% of respondents chose the <<researcher>>. At the same time, the ratio among female-doctors has 41 and 33%, respectively. Among female students, in most cases, indicated the lack of such a dilemma (family/career). Female doctors have a ratio of 50:50, respectively. In the question about pay, more than 75% of respondents were confident about receiving equal pay, similar to male doctors. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The increasing number of female urologists across the world is a nowadays reality. Rejection of existing stereotypes, elements of gender discrimination from colleagues and patients, mentoring, awareness-building - will help attract young female doctors to the urological specialty. These aspects will be the first step in changing of the current urology.",2022,/,"Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",30,s1,1116EP  - 1120,639556096,https://dx.doi.org/10.32687/0869-866X-2022-30-s1-1116-1120,36385085,#107,Sarukhanian 2022,"",""
Gender-Specific Attitudes of Internal Medicine Residents Toward Gastroenterology,Advani R.; ; Arjonilla M.; Guerson A.; Taub E.; Monzur F.,"Background and Aims: Female representation among gastroenterology (GI) fellows has remained around 30%, yet women comprise over 50% of internal medicine (IM) residents. We aim to identify the gender-specific barriers of IM residents toward pursuing GI. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We surveyed IM residents in the Northeast by emailing 168 IM programs a survey link to be distributed to their residents. A 4-point Likert barrier scale and bivariate analysis were performed with ""yes"" and ""no,"" where ""yes"" was analyzed as ""somewhat of a barrier"" and above. Females received a third table assessing female-specific barriers. Significance was set at < 0.05. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 215 survey responses, 56.3% (n = 121) were female. Response rate could not be determined due to resident identity protection and inconsistent responses of survey dissemination from programs. Females had significantly greater concerns about fertility, maternity leave, radiation exposure, work-life balance, stress, and burnout compared to males (p < 0.05). For females, 48.7% felt a lack of gender diversity in GI, 54.6% felt a lack of female GI mentors, and 43.7% felt there is a lack of respect as a female in GI. No gender differences existed in motivation to pursue GI, exposure to GI, and access to GI mentors, or GI-related research. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study reveals that female IM trainees had greater concerns surrounding fertility, radiation exposure, and maternity leave compared to male IM trainees. Lack of gender diversity and lack of female GI mentors were noted barriers for female IM trainees.

Mentoring Relationships and Gender Inequities in Academic Medicine: Findings From a Multi-Institutional Qualitative Study,Murphy M.; ; Record H.; Callander J.K.; Dohan D.; Grandis J.R.,"PURPOSE: This study examined how mentoring relationships may reinforce or mitigate gender inequities in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In-depth, semistructured interviews with medical school faculty members (52 women and 52 men) were conducted at 16 institutions across the United States in 2019. Institutions were recruited using a purposive sampling strategy to seek diversity in geography, ownership (private or public), and prestige. Within institutions, purposive sampling was used to recruit equal numbers of women and men and to seek diversity in degree type (MD, PhD), age, and career stage. A coding scheme was developed through iterative analysis of the interview transcripts. All interview transcripts were then coded with the goal of identifying intersections between mentorship and experiences of and responses to gender inequities. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Four key themes at the intersection of mentoring relationships and gender inequities were identified. (1) Both women and men became aware of gender inequities in academic medicine through relationships with women mentors and mentees. (2) Both women and men mentors recognized the challenges their female mentees faced and made deliberate efforts to help them navigate an inequitable environment. (3) Both women and men mentors modeled work-family balance and created family friendly environments for their mentees. (4) Some women, but no men, reported being sexually harassed by mentors. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities are acknowledged and mitigated. It also shows that mentoring relationships may be a context in which gender inequities, such as sexual harassment, may occur. Sexual harassment in academic medicine has been widely documented, and gender inequity in academic medicine has proved persistent. While mentoring relationships may have the potential to identify and mitigate gender inequities, this study suggests that this potential remains largely unrealized.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2022,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,97,1,136EP  - 142,636099119,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004388,34495884,#109,Murphy 2022,"",""

Women in academia pursuing nonlinear career paths experience negative impacts on career trajectory. No published studies have examined how pursuit of nonlinear career paths might perpetuate gender inequities within academic hospital medicine. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): (1) Compare the frequency of nonlinear career paths by gender among academic hospitalists; (2) assess the perceived impact of two types of nonlinear career paths-extended leave (EL) and non-traditional work arrangements (NTWA) on hospitalists' personal lives and careers. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Cross-sectional descriptive survey study of adult hospitalist physicians in three academic centers within the USA. <ovid:br/>Intervention(s): Electronic survey including closed- and open-ended items assessing respondent utilization of and experiences with nonlinear career paths. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Associations between EL and demographic variables as well as gender differences in leave length and NTWA strategies using Fisher's exact test; 2) grounded theory qualitative analysis of open-text responses. Key Results: Compared with men, women reported taking EL more often (p = 0.035) and for longer periods (p = 0.002). Men and women reported taking NTWA at similar rates. Women reported negative impacts of EL within domains of personal life, career, well-being, and work-life integration whereas men only reported negative impacts to career.

Graduate Student Women's Perceptions of Faculty Careers: The Critical Role of Departmental Values and Support in Career Choice,Howe M.E.; ; Kim M.M.; Pazicni S.,"While the number of women in undergraduate and graduate chemistry programs has increased in recent years, women remain under-represented and excluded in the ranks of faculty in chemistry higher education. This marginalization results from not only fewer women being offered faculty positions but also fewer women applying for these positions. To investigate the reasons why faculty positions are causing so many women to turn elsewhere for employment, a survey was designed based on the literature themes surrounding women's career choices, interviews with the current graduate student women in chemistry programs, and our previous work. The survey was grounded in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), and data were analyzed through a QuantCrit lens. Despite the existing literature focusing on the impact of having children on women's career decisions, the desire to have children did not appear among either the top priorities or the most important factors in predicting whether any of the 130 survey respondents were interested in a faculty career. Instead, faculty career interest was related to themes of overwork, high expectations from departments, and expected department emphasis on research despite an individual's interest in teaching and mentoring. Furthermore, women expressed a strong interest in maintaining work-life balance but low expectations for their ability to obtain a position that would allow it. They also reported a desire to work for a department that values mental health and diversity and supports its community members but similarly low expectations for their ability to find a department that shares these values. These themes suggest that chemistry departments must make fundamental changes regarding what is tangibly valued and rewarded within their systems if they wish to reduce the exclusion of women in faculty positions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE.-: To identify the prevalence of burnout within Canadian pathology, drivers of burnout important in pathology, and pathologist burnout mitigation strategies at an individual and departmental level. DESIGN.-: An electronic survey was disseminated by participating departmental chiefs and the Canadian Association of Pathologists. Survey content included the Maslach Burnout Inventory and 3 free-text questions, including: ""What do you find most stressful about your work?"" and ""What is working for you, at an individual or departmental level, to mitigate against burnout?""

Medical Student Parental Leave Policies at U.S. Medical Schools,Roselin D.; ; Lee J.; Jagsi R.; Blair-Loy M.; Ira K.; Dahiya P.; Williams J.; Mangurian C.,"Background: As medical training occurs during prime childbearing years, parental leave policies may affect the career and family choices of medical students. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study builds on existing research by quantifying the prevalence of formal policies for parental leave in highly ranked United States Medical Degree granting institutions, and analyzing the characteristics of those policies, with the objective of identifying existing best practices for future policy adopters to consider. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Only 14% of the medical schools reviewed had substantive, stand-alone parental leave policies, and the majority of schools had leave of absence policies without mention of parental leave. <ovid:br/>Discussion(s): Leveraging the authors' legal and medical expertise, this analysis highlights existing best practices for medical school leadership to consider, as they examine and develop their policies. Best practices utilized by institutions with the most robust parental policies include adopting a formal and public parental policy, providing a parental enrolled academic adjustment option, guaranteeing approval to take and return from leave/academic adjustment, and continuing health care and financial aid benefits. Given the role of childbearing as a factor associated with gender disparities in academic medicine, and potential impact on racial disparities for students of color, medical school leadership should consider implementation of best practice parental policies to promote equity and wellness of their students. In fact, the deficit of robust parental leave policies in most highly ranked schools may contribute to existing gender and racial disparities in violation with antidiscrimination law.

,Busson-Spielberger M.; ,"Background and goals: For years, the number of female medical students has been increasing: Currently, more women than men are enrolled in medicine.

Similar figures are reported in other studies. The fact that female physicians are less often found at higher hierarchy levels can have various causes. On the one hand, this may be due to the adoption of traditional role models. On the other hand, the experience of the difficult reconciliation of family and career may have an influence.

Women in Rheumatology in the Arab League of Associations for Rheumatology Countries: A Rising Workforce,Ziade N.; ; Hmamouchi I.; El Kibbi L.,"Background: An increase in women physicians in the medical workforce is witnessed in recent decades, paralleled by an increase in leadership positions and, to a lesser extent, in academic advancement. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate the women rheumatologists (WR) workforce and to identify the challenges faced by WR in the Arab League of Associations for Rheumatology (ArLAR) countries. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We collected data from members of special interest groups from 16 ArLAR countries about the number of rheumatologists in the national societies and boards - including WR -, and the estimated percentage of WR involved in academia. Also, a sample of WR was identified based on their established leadership positions and invited to a structured interview addressing their career path and the gender-related challenges. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The proportion of WR varied widely across the ArLAR countries, with a mean of 56%. Moreover, WR constituted 47% of the society's board members and roughly 49% of WR were involved in academia. However, only 37% of the current society presidents were females. Structured interviews indicated that WR place a high value on patient care and teaching, followed by research and publications. The primary reported gender-related challenge was balancing work with family demands. Moreover, some WR reported gender-related discrimination incurred by colleagues, patients, and administrations. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): WR constituted more than half of the current rheumatology workforce in the ArLAR countries, with a lower - but steadily growing - proportion of WR in leadership positions. As they embrace their growing role in the workforce, WR must benefit from all the provided tools, from learning from the experience of current women leaders in the field to using the latest technology such as social media platforms to empower them to reach gender equity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Ziade, Hmamouchi and El Kibbi.",2022,/,Frontiers in Medicine,9,"(Ziade) Rheumatology Department, Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Saint Joseph's University, Beirut, Lebanon(Hmamouchi) Rheumatology Unit, Temara Hospital, Laboratory of Biostatistics, Clinical Research and Epidemiology (LBRCE), Faculty of Medicine and Phar",880285,2017986065,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.880285,,#117,Ziade 2022,"",""
"GENDER DIVERSITY AMONG EDITORIAL BOARDS OF NEONATAL, PERINATAL, PEDIATRIC, AND MATERNALFETAL MEDICINE JOURNALS",Sakaria S.; ; Kushnir A.,"Purpose of Study Historically, women have been underrepresented in medicine compared to the general population. Throughout the years, their representation in medical school has significantly increased. While gender diversity in medicine is slowly increasing, this does not necessarily correlate to gender inclusion. There are many areas within the medical field in which inequities exist, particularly regarding career advancements, including holding positions on leadership boards, including journal editorial boards. This type of gender disparity could reflect a lack of equity for women in the field of Neonatology, Perinatology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and Pediatrics. This can impact career progression in both academic and clinical settings and promote gender based discrimination in the workplace. Women physicians are increasing in number, with many candidates holding titles of associate professors and professors. While women may face more societal pressures on balancing personal life and career, it should not have any impact on their representation in leadership positions. However, there is research showing delay in career advancement and fewer women in higher ranking positions compared to their male counterparts. Our objective is to quantify gender representation among editorial boards of neonatal/perinatal/pediatric journals and examine gender inequities. Methods Used An analysis of 50 editorial boards of Neonatal, Perinatal, Pediatric, and Maternal-fetal medicine journals from across the world. Evaluation of the editorial boards included documenting the difference in genders among the editors-in chief, deputy editors, executive editors, associate editors, and section editors of the published journals. Summary of Results Of the 50 editors-in chief, 22% were women, only 2 executive editors were noted, both of whom were men. Women composed 39% of the 23 associate editors. Of the 9 journal boards that included a deputy editor, 4 (44%) of them had a women holding that position, while of the 21 journals which included a section editor, 29% were women. From all 50 journals, the executive boards composed a total of 1,338 editors, with 439 (33%) of them being women and 899 (67%) being men. Conclusions The current data shows that women hold the minority of editorial positions compared to men. Future direction in the field should emphasize a push towards more equal representation of men and women on editorial boards and in positions of leadership overall. This can decrease bias and discrimination in the workplace, while also lessening the gender gap in the workforce.

31932 Mentorship opportunity for female dermatologists seeking to balance family and career,Grinnell M.; ; Trowbridge R.; Lee E.; Wysong A.,"Background: Women's representation in medicine has increased drastically, however, a sex gap remains in higher academic leadership. This study aims to explore potential reasons for this gap through analyzing survey feedback from dermatologists in a variety of practice settings. <ovid:br/>Method(s): We used REDcap to collect 144 surveys from dermatologists actively practicing in the United States. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Sixty responses came from the Women's Dermatologic Society, 46 came from the Association of Professors of Dermatology, and 38 came from Facebook groups. Of the total included respondents, 84% were female. Forty-six respondents worked in private practice, 89 worked in academics, 8 worked in a combination of private practice and academics, and 1 person did not describe practice type. Differences between academics and private practice respondents were seen in questions related to mentorship and goals. In academics, 71% of respondents reported having a relatable mentor while only 46% of those in private practice reported having a relatable mentor (P =.008). Few reported having a mentor that helps balance career and family (27% in academics, 24% in private practice, P =.86). Respondents who report being responsible for a distinct majority of nonfinancial family-oriented tasks such as housekeeping and childcare were less likely to report having a relatable mentor. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that female dermatologists seeking to balance career and family aspirations report may benefit from increased mentorship and support.

GENDER RELATED BARRIERS TO INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENTS PURSUING FELLOWSHIP TRAINING IN GASTROENTEROLOGY,Advani R.; ; Saeed N.; Suarez M.A.; Gil A.G.; Qureshi H.; Kardashian A.; May F.F.P.; Monzur F.,"INTRODUCTION: Women gastroenterologists comprise 15% of the gastroenterology (GI) workforce, despite females making up 30% of GI fellows and over 50% of medical students in the USA. Recent data have highlighted biases and gender inequities that are perceived by GI fellows, along with well-studied factors including the apparent compensation inequality between genders, the glass-ceiling in academia, and the ""leaky pipeline"" for women in medicine. Barriers to pursuing GI fellowship have not been studied at the resident level. We aimed to determine gender-specific barriers that may prevent internal medicine (IM) residents from pursuing GI fellowship. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Our multicenter team distributed an IRB-approved electronic survey to residents in IM residency programs nationwide. Multiple rounds of emails with the survey description and link were sent to program directors and coordinators to forward to their residents. Four-point Likert barrier scales were used where ""not a barrier"" was analyzed as ""no"" and ""somewhat a barrier"" to ""extreme barrier"" was analyzed as ""yes"". Frequencies and Chi-square tests (p<0.05) were used to compare barriers by gender. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Of 627 trainee respondents, mean age was 29.9 years (SD=4.2) with 310 (49.4%) being female. 47.2% were White, 32.4% were Asian, 6.1% were Black, and 12.4% were Hispanic (Table). 41% were married and 21.4% had one or more children. 31.1% responses were from the Northeast, 28.4% from the South, and 20.9% from the Midwest. The majority were MDs (68.8%) or DOs (18.8%), and 60.6% were American medical graduates (AMGs). 294 (46.9%) trainees reported being interested in GI, of which 94/145 (64.8%) females and 82/149 (55.0%) males were planning to apply for GI fellowship. Female trainees were more likely to report concerns about delayed childbearing (84.7 vs 49.3%, p<0.00001), childcare (62.4 vs 43.3%, p<0.00001), paternity/maternity leave (63.8 vs 42.6%, p<0.00001), lack of mentorship (69.9% vs 61.5%, p=0.04), and work-life balance (75.3 vs 63.7%, p=0.003) as barriers to pursuing GI fellowship, compared to male trainees (Figure). Female trainees also reported a perceived lack of respect, compensation inequality, glass ceiling limitations, concerns about harassment, and lack of same-sex mentors more often than male counterparts. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Our study revealed several gender-specific barriers that may prevent IM residents from pursuing fellowship training in GI. Potential interventions for female trainees include structured mentorship pathways, better resources for parental leave, and interventions to reduce stress/burnout and improve work-life balance. We propose addressing these barriers to improve gender representation and equity in the field of GI.

Why are women still leaving academic medicine? A qualitative study within a London Medical School,Salem V.; ; Hirani D.; Lloyd C.; Regan L.; Peters C.J.,"Objectives To identify factors that influenced women who chose to leave academic medicine. Design and main outcome measures Independent consultants led a focus group of women in medicine who had left academia after completion of their postgraduate research degree at Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. Thematic analysis was performed on the transcribed conversations. Participants and setting Nine women physicians who completed a postgraduate degree (MD or PhD) at a large London Medical School and Academic Health Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, but did not go on to pursue a career in academic medicine. Results Influences to leave clinical academia were summarised under eight themes - career intentions, supervisor support, institutional human resources support, inclusivity, work-life balance, expectations, mentors and role models, and pregnancy and maternity leave. Conclusion The women in our focus group reported several factors contributing to their decision to leave clinical academia, which included lack of mentoring tailored to specific needs, low levels of acceptance for flexible working to help meet parental responsibilities and perceived explicit gender biases. We summarise the multiple targeted strategies that Imperial College London has implemented to promote retention of women in academic medicine, although more research needs to be done to ascertain the most effective interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Gender diversity in radiology: Shedding light on the 256 shades of grey,McCloskey C.; ; Lee E.,"Learning Objectives: * Identify modifiable factors contributing to the gender gap in Clinical Radiology Trainees. * Identify differences in reasons between male and female junior doctor's for not pursuing Clinical Radiology. * Identify modifiable factors deterring medical students / junior doctors from considering a career in Clinical Radiology. * Provide answers to why more female junior doctors are not pursuing a career in Radiology. <ovid:br/>Background(s): In recent years, Australian medical schools have seen an increase in the proportion of female to male medical students with current cohorts being made up of approximately 50% males to females (1). Despite this, Clinical Radiology Trainee demographics from the last 5 years do not reflect these figures (2). Clinical Radiology is academically challenging, offers a broad range of subspecialty options, and can provide achievable work hours, allowing time for family and life outside of work; important criterion for many people when choosing a specialty. Despite this, Radiology remains a predominantly male dominated specialty (2, 3, 4). Furthermore, in Australia there is no available research investigating possible causes for this difference. Imaging Findings OR Procedure Details: This is a prospective, multi-center study using a voluntary, anonymous questionnaire aimed at medical students and junior doctors. At the time of this abstract, 94 responses have been collected. Interim results: * 54% of respondents are female * 32% say they have very little, if any exposure to radiology in medical school * 12% (11) are considering radiology as a career (27% (3) are females) * Main reasons for not pursuing radiology * 61% limited patient contact * 50% too lonely (limited colleague contact) * 46% not enough exposure * 59% are not considering Radiology at all. Of these, they may change their mind if: * 51% more exposure in medical school * 35% more patient contact * 22% better work-life balance * 20% more mentorship * 40% are considering it but either see a few issues or have other interests as well. Of these, they may change their mind if: * 62% more exposure in medical school * 54% more patient contact * 12% more mentorship <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Interim results demonstrate that although 57% of respondents are female, only 27% of these are considering Clinical Radiology as a career, aligning with current RANZCR statistics.

FAMILY BUILDING AND PARENTHOOD ALTERS THE CAREER TRAJECTORY OF WOMEN IN MEDICINE,Bakkensen J.B.; ; Lawson A.K.; Smith K.S.; Moreno P.I.; Cheung E.O.; Goldman K.N.; Feinberg E.C.,"Objective: Although most medical school graduates are women, pervasive gender disparities exist in time to promotion, achievement of academic rank, and appointment to leadership positions, with no narrowing of this gap over time. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which women in medicine alter their career trajectories and family building plans in order to balance parenthood and career. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): A survey was electronically distributed to female physicians through a national social media campaign from March 2022-April 2022. Descriptive data on demographics, household responsibilities, family building, and career considerations were collected using multiple choice items and Likert-type scales. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 741 female physicians completed the survey including 512 attendings, 66 fellows, and 89 residents from academic, private, and community practice settings (mean age = 38.8 years, SD = 7.69). The majority were heterosexual (n = 670, 90.4%), married/partnered (n = 632, 85.3%), and had children (n = 496, 66.9%). Seventy-nine percent reported having delayed or are currently delaying family building due to medical training or career. Among those who specified the duration of delay, 46.2% delayed 0-3 years, 31.4% 3-5 years, and 22.4% >=5 years. The most commonly cited factors influencing timing of childbearing either ""moderately,"" ""very much,"" or ""extremely"" were lack of schedule flexibility (76.0%), lack of time (71.2%), stress (69.7%), and concern about burdening colleagues (49.3%). Thirty-nine percent of respondents had considered egg/embryo freezing for fertility preservation, and 12.6% had frozen eggs/embryos. Most women (61.1%) stated they were responsible for >= 50% of household maintenance roles (e.g. cleaning, groceries, cooking, laundry), and 57.3% stated they were responsible for >= 50% of family maintenance (e.g. childcare, eldercare, healthcare appointments, school forms), despite twice as many reporting personally working >= 60 hours/week vs. having a partner who worked >= 60 hours/week (27.8% vs. 13.6%, p<0.05). In order to accommodate childbearing or parenthood, 34.1% did not take opportunities for career advancement, 33.3% reduced their work hours, 20.5% chose a different specialty, and 18.5% changed their work setting (academic vs. private practice). Twenty-two women (3.0%) had left medicine entirely. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this large national survey of female physicians from diverse specialties and practice locations, respondents cited significant career-related pressures coupled with increased household responsibilities that influenced the timing of childbearing and reported marked alterations in career trajectory to accommodate family building and parenthood.

ANALYSIS ON THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OF ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES,Chen J.; ; Xing T.,"Background: The progress of national social economy puts forward higher requirements for the education of high-quality talents, and colleges and universities, as the training base of high-quality professional and skilled talents, have played an unparalleled role in the development of national economy and science and technology. The administrative personnel in colleges and universities are an important factor in the development of colleges and universities. The level of administrative management in colleges and universities is directly related to the smooth development of administrative management and teaching arrangements in colleges and universities. In recent years, due to the needs of social development and the change of policy direction, colleges and universities continue to expand enrollment, the number of college students continues to increase, and the workload of college administrators has increased significantly, which increases the work pressure of college administrators. Under the high requirements and high volume of university administration, university administrators have high psychological pressure and are prone to psychological imbalance, which has a negative impact on the smooth implementation of university administration. Workplace environment is one of the main life scenes of people. About one-third of people's time and energy are invested in workplace work every day. Therefore, the working environment and state are directly related to people's daily psychological quality and affect people's psychological and physiological level. The university administrators need to invest a lot of emotion in the work process, and the continuity of university management is strong. Under the long-time and high-intensity work tasks, some university administrators may have lost or bored emotions. The administrative work of colleges and universities also has the characteristics of detail and tediousness. The work content is relatively monotonous. Some college administrators have a low sense of self-identity in their work and think it is difficult to give full play to their self-worth in their work, so they fall into negative emotions, resulting in a sharp rise in the psychological pressure of college administrators. Under the accelerating social rhythm, college administrators are affected by the dual effects of life pressure and work pressure, which may lead to physiological and psychological fatigue and tension, so as to reduce the mental health level and quality of life of college administrators. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To study and analyze the psychological stress level of university administrators, hoping to truly and objectively reflect the psychological status of university administrators through data extraction, mining and analysis, and explore the individual differences of psychological quality of university administrators. Through the analysis of the level and difference of psychological pressure of university administrators, this paper deeply excavates the reasons behind the psychological pressure of university administrators, and puts forward corresponding countermeasures on this basis, so as to provide help for improving the mental health level of university administrators. Research design: The research extracted and sorted out the psychological state-related information of university administrators from the physical examination database of university employees, collected the basic information of career development, family environment, personal characteristics and other aspects of university administrators, and deeply analyzed the psychological state level of university administrators. To provide reference for exploring the influencing factors of psychological stress and burnout of university administrators. The research uses the analytic hierarchy process to analyze the influencing factors of the psychological state of university administrators, combined with the information of university administrators, constructs the psychological impact index system of university administrators, and uses the analytic hierarchy process to solve the characteristic vector and priority weight of the impact index, so as to lay the foundation for putting forward the coping strategies of psychological pressure of university administrators. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The statistical results of psychological stress and burnout of college administrators are shown in Table 1. College administrators of different ages have the phenomenon of job burnout. They have great psychological pressure in their daily work, among which the level of psychological stress and job burnout of college administrators aged 35-45 is the highest. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In recent years, with the development of social economy, the requirements for the working ability of university administrators are higher and higher. University administrators are prone to psychological imbalance and have low awareness of their roles in work, which makes university administrators under psychological pressure for a long time, it is not conducive to the development and efficient long-term development of administrative affairs in colleges and universities. This paper analyzes the psychological pressure of university administrators. There are individual differences in age and gender. Compared with male administrators, female university administrators have greater psychological pressure and higher degree of job burnout than men. With the growth of age, the degree of the psychological pressure of college administrators is also gradually increasing, and the work enthusiasm of young administrators is higher.

PERCEPTIONS OF GENDER EQUITY BY UROLOGIC SUBSPECIALTY,Haslam R.; ; Agnor R.; Collins A.; Martin L.; Bassale S.; Seideman C.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Urology has experienced significant growth in female representation. The most recent AUA census data estimates women comprise 10% of practicing urologists, and~30% of trainees. As medicine progresses toward gender equity in the trainee and physician workforce, large disparities in overall compensation, academic positions, and leadership advancement continue to exist. A better understanding of the perceptions of the formal and informal culture among urologists may provide insight into the persistent gender disparities. We sought to evaluate how urologists in various subspecialties view the climate for women physicians and compare perceptions and experiences of gender inequity based on characteristics including gender, subspecialty training, faculty status, parental status, and years in practice. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): An IRB approved survey was sent out to the following list-serves: Society of Urological Oncology (SUO), Society of Endourology (ENDO), Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons (GURS), Society of Pediatric Urology (SPU), Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU), and American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS). We utilized a validated study, the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS, higher scores indicating a better perceived culture toward women). Subcategories (equal access, work-life balance, freedom of gender bias, and leadership support) were also analyzed. CCWAS scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and Kruskal- Wallace tests. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): There were 430 survey responses (35.3% female, 64.7% male). There was a statistically significant difference in total CCWAS scores on the Kruskal-Wallace test for gender, parental status, and society. However, on multiple regression analysis controlling for gender, parental status and society were no longer statistically significant. There was no significant difference in CCWAS scored based on years in practice or private versus academic practice. Male physicians perceived practice culture toward women as more favorable/equitable than their female colleagues, (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 203.5 [184.25, 225.0] vs 162.0 [130.75, 188.0]; P<0.0001). This discrepancy in perception between genders was consistent across all subcategories; equal access, work-life balance, freedom of gender bias, and leadership support. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study suggests that there are genderbased differences in how gender inequities are perceived and experienced in urology.

Our objective was to describe the experiences of Canadian radiation oncologists (RO) with caregiving/parental roles and to illustrate challenges that exist, whilst dealing with professional work. Materials/Methods: An online survey was administered (November - January 2022) to registered staff RO members of the Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology (CARO). The survey consisted of 57 multiple choice and 7 open-ended questions on demographics, parental and other family caregiver roles. Descriptive statistics summarized survey responses and thematic analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. Qualitative data was analyzed using SAS with Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, a two-sided p-value of <0.05 was deemed statistically significant (SS). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of the 271 CARO members, 103 staff RO responded (38%): 45% female and 55% male. Most participants were <50 years old (78, 76%), Canadian MD graduates (75, 73%) with <15-years of practice (76, 74%). The majority (76%) of respondents identified as having a parental and/or non-parental caregiving role (8%). There was no difference between respondents' gender and number of children (median 2 (range: 1-4), p=0.5). A SS higher proportion of females compared to males took parental leave for each pregnancy, with more females (71%) receiving financial support (employment insurance, employer contribution and/or paid vacation) compared to males (44%) for the 1<ovid:sup>st</ovid:sup> and 2<ovid:sup>nd</ovid:sup> parental leave only. Median duration of parental leave by female's vs males for 1<ovid:sup>st</ovid:sup> and 2<ovid:sup>nd</ovid:sup> child was 26 vs 4 weeks and 22 vs 4 weeks. Half of female respondents (52%) identified as having a positive parent mentor at work compared to 26% of male respondents (p=0.02). A higher proportion of females described having a child negatively impacted their career (50% vs 28%, p=0.06) with similar gender proportions describing attendance at conferences (77% vs 65%, p=0.3) and early/late work meetings (79% vs 76%, p=0.7) affected by having children. Respondents described balancing work-life, dealing with sudden illness of children and bringing children to pre- and post-school activities as examples of daily challenges experienced.

The EULAR convened a task force to obtain empirical evidence on the potential unmet need for support of female rheumatologists, health professionals and non-clinical scientists in academic rheumatology. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised three web-based surveys conducted in 2020 among: (1) EULAR scientific member society leaders, (2) EULAR and Emerging EULAR Network (EMEUNET) members and (3) EULAR Council members. Statistics were descriptive with significance testing for male/female responses assessed by chi 2 test and t-test. Results Data from EULAR scientific member societies in 13 countries indicated that there were disproportionately fewer women in academic rheumatology than in clinical rheumatology, and they tended to be under-represented in senior academic roles. From 324 responses of EULAR and EMEUNET members (24 countries), we detected no gender differences in leadership aspirations, self-efficacy in career advancement and work-life integration as well as the share of time spent on research, but there were gender differences in working hours and the levels of perceived gender discrimination and sexual harassment. There were gender differences in the ranking of 7 of 26 factors impacting career advancement and of 8 of 24 potential interventions to aid career advancement.

The parent penalty: Parental leave and return to work in trainees and early-career faculty in oncology,Malapati S.J.; ; Singh S.R.K.; Idossa D.; Bruno X.J.; Chino F.; Patel M.A.; Wei Z.; Duma N.,"Background: Prime childbearing years occur during medical training and early career, leaving physicians with tough choices between family planning and career growth. Restrictive parental leave (PL) policies can affect physician well-being and limit decisions about reproduction. We evaluated Medical and Radiation Oncology trainees and early career faculty to assess policies and practices regarding PL and return to work. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An anonymous 48 question cross-sectional survey developed by researchers with expertise in gender equity was distributed via email and social media channels between May and June 2021 to oncology trainees and physicians within 5 years of terminal training. Descriptive statistics were used to compare study groups. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 255 physicians completed the survey- 54% female, 65% Medical Oncology and 35% Radiation Oncology, 71% trainees and 29% early career faculty. 46% (117) had no formal PL policy during training. PL impacted selection of first job for 37% (94) participants. Of all responders, 114 used PL, either in early career (18%), as a trainee (69%) or both (13%). Duration of PL during training was <=4 weeks in 37%, 4-6 weeks in 19%, 6-8 weeks in 12% and >=8 weeks in 24%. 27% of those who took PL as a trainee had to extend training to allow for this. Only 27%(31) of those who took PL had resources available at workplace to assist with transitioning back to work, primarily from informal mentoring by faculty/colleagues (65%, 20).

Merging motherhood and medicine: A qualitative study exploring barriers and enablers to motherhood among female doctors in Australia,Collie E.; ; Lew R.; Peate M.,"Objectives: To identify barriers and enablers to motherhood experienced by female doctors in Australia. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 18 female physician-mothers in Australia, during March and May 2020. Interview data were examined using thematic analysis to extract key themes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Six key barriers and seven key enablers were identified. Barriers (B1-6) largely reflected structural and cultural issues operating within health services and the wider medical profession. Barriers were the experience of working in medicine (B1); demands of postgraduate specialty training (B2); attitudes towards mothers in medicine (B3); gender inequality (B4); insufficient entitlements and support (B5); and competing priorities, conflicting roles (B6). Enablers were supportive partnerships (E1); break from traditional gender roles (E2); capacity to delegate/outsource (E3); doctors supporting doctors (E4); flexible work arrangements (E5); increasing acceptance and support (E6); and capacity to combine career and family (E7). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): This was the first qualitative study to explore motherhood experiences among female doctors in Australia.

The Role of Gender in Careers in Medicine: a Systematic Review and Thematic Synthesis of Qualitative Literature,Winkel A.F.; ; Telzak B.; Shaw J.; Hollond C.; Magro J.; Nicholson J.; Quinn G.,"Abstract: Background: Gender disparities exist in the careers of women in medicine. This review explores the qualitative literature to understand how gender influences professional trajectories, and identify opportunities for intervention. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A systematic review and thematic synthesis included articles obtained from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), APA PsycInfo (Ovid), and GenderWatch (ProQuest) on June 26 2020, updated on September 10, 2020. Included studies explored specialty choice, leadership roles, practice setting, burnout, promotion, stigma, mentoring, and organizational culture. Studies taking place outside of the USA, using only quantitative data, conducted prior to 2000, or focused on other health professions were excluded. Data were extracted using a standardized extraction tool and assessed for rigor and quality using a 9-item appraisal tool. A three-step process for thematic synthesis was used to generate analytic themes and construct a conceptual model. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020199999). <ovid:br/>Finding(s): Among 1524 studies identified, 64 were eligible for analysis. Five themes contributed to a conceptual model for the influence of gender on women's careers in medicine that resembles a developmental socio-ecological model. Gender influences career development externally through culture which valorizes masculine stereotypes and internally shapes women's integration of personal and professional values. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Medical culture and structures are implicitly biased against women. Equitable environments in education, mentoring, hiring, promotion, compensation, and support for work-life integration are needed to address gender disparities in medicine.

Gender Differences and Influencing Factors in Specialty Choices: Findings From One Medical School in China,Yin K.; ; Yang L.; Zhang R.; Zheng D.; Wilkes M.S.; Lai Y.,"Background: Gender plays a significant role in the selection of medical specialty. Few studies have been conducted to explore the impact of gender differences on specialty choosing among Chinese medical students. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The specialty choices of 648 students from six consecutive classes in an 8-year MD program were collected and compared between male and female students. A total of 110 students from one graduating class were surveyed by a questionnaire covering 22 career influencing factors. Each factor has a scale of zero to three (zero = no influence, one = mild influence, two = moderate influence, and three = strong influence). <ovid:br/>Result(s): Statistically significant gender differences were observed in 10 out of 16 specialties. Most male students limited their specialty choices to surgery (64%), internal medicine (12%), and orthopedics (12%), compared with a relatively diversified pattern in female students. For male students, the top three influencing factors were personal interest, future job prospects for the chosen specialty, and job opportunity in academic medicine. The strongest influencing factors of females were personal interest, specialty-specific knowledge and skills, and the sense of achievement. The expected salary was ranked among the top 10 influencing factors in male but not in females, while the work-life balance was ranked among the top 10 factors in females but not in males. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): There is a significant gender difference regarding specialty choices among Chinese medical students.

What Women Need: a Study of Institutional Factors and Women Faculty's Intent to Remain in Academic Medicine,Onumah C.; ; Wikstrom S.; Valencia V.; Cioletti A.,"Background: A longstanding gender gap exists in the retention of women in academic medicine. Several strategies have been suggested to promote the retention of women, but there are limited data on impacts of interventions. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify what institutional factors, if any, impact women faculty's intent to remain in academic medicine, either at their institutions or elsewhere. <ovid:br/>Design(s): A survey was designed to evaluate institutional retention-linked factors, programs and interventions, their impact, and women's intent to remain at their institutions and within academic medicine. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics and regression analyses. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Women with faculty appointments within departments of medicine recruited from national organizations and specific social media groups. Main Measures: Institutional factors that may be associated with women's decision to remain at their current institutions or within academic medicine. Key Results: Of 410 surveys of women at institutions across the USA, fair and transparent family leave policies and opportunities for work-life integration showed strong associations with intent to remain at one's institution (leave policies: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.20-4.18, p = 0.01; work-life: OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.50-9.64, p < 0.001) and within academic medicine (leave policies: OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.09-5.03, p = 0.03; work-life: OR 4.66, 95% CI 2.04-11.36, p < 0.001). Other institutional factors associated with intent to remain in academics include peer mentorship (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.56-6.57, p < 0.01) and women role models (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.68, p = 0.04). Institutions helping employees recognize bias, fair compensation and provision of resources, satisfaction with mentorship, peer mentorship, and women role models within the institutions were associated with intent to remain at an institution. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that institutional factors such as support for work-life integration, fair and transparent policies, and meaningful mentorship opportunities appear impactful in the retention of women in academic medicine.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Society of General Internal Medicine.",2021,/,Journal of General Internal Medicine,36,7,2039EP  - 2047,2011464893,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06771-z,33973153,#134,Onumah 2021,"",""
Gender differences in physician decisions to adopt new prescription drugs,Mendez S.J.; ; Scott A.; Zhang Y.,"Physician adoption of new technologies is a key issue for population health and the sustainability of the healthcare system. This paper explores gender differences in general practitioners' (GPs) adoption of new oral anticoagulants. We combine detailed individual data on physician and practice style characteristics from the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) panel survey of Australian physicians with administrative prescribing data from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) for the period January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015. After adjusting for various factors proposed in the literature as drivers of this gender gap, in addition to risk preferences and personality traits, we find a large statistical gender difference in the speed of adoption with men being faster than women in uptake. However, conditional on having prescribed for the first time, female and male GPs differ only slightly in the intensity of use of these new drugs. We show that the gender gap depends on the measure of uptake and discuss possible channels that could be driving the relatively large gender difference that remains in the speed of adoption.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,/,Social Science and Medicine,277,"(Mendez, Scott, Zhang) Melbourne Institute: Applied Economic & Social Research, The University of Melbourne, The University of Melbourne, 111 Barry Street, VIC, Australia",113886,2011708042,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113886,33882439,#135,Mendez 2021,"",""
Targeting Causes of Burnout in Residency: An Innovative Approach Used at Hennepin Healthcare,Quirk R.; ; Rodin H.; Linzer M.,"PROBLEM: Rates of burnout are high in physicians in the United States. While others have reported on the success of burnout-reduction strategies on practicing physicians and residents, few strategies have approached the problem longitudinally in residents. APPROACH: From 2014 to 2019, the authors used a previously developed survey to assess factors related to resident burnout, including sleep, personal time, professional fulfillment, effects on relationships, program recognition, and peer support. At Hennepin Healthcare, a safety-net hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the authors created a reproducible process for collecting data from internal medicine residents annually, and for using evidence-based conceptual frameworks to develop a continuous improvement method to address worklife across training years. Interventions included jeopardy coverage for essential life events, a newsletter celebrating resident achievements, removal of after-hours consult pager call, an extra day off for senior residents on the wards, and care packages distributed to night teams. <ovid:br/>OUTCOME(S): Annually from 2014 to 2019, 40/66 (60.6%) to 62/73 residents (84.9%) completed the survey (average response rate was 72.1% over 6 years). Survey results were shared with residents in multiple formats, and feedback was requested, demonstrating that burnout reduction is a priority for program leadership. High professional fulfillment scores were documented every year. Self-reported rates of burnout were between 25% and 35%. Significant improvements were seen in perception of empathy, sleep impairment, and peer support. NEXT STEPS: The authors developed a plan for minimizing burnout, which includes the following evidence-based domains: workload, control, balance in effort and reward, work-life balance, fairness, values, support, gender equity, moral distress, and moral injury. Additional interventions include protected time for didactics, trauma-informed care training, and addressing workplace racism. The authors aspire to achieve an integrated culture of well-being for residents and faculty; foster an efficient, effective, and fair learning environment; and reduce-and ultimately eliminate-burnout.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2021,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,96,5,690EP  - 694,634111744,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003940,33496434,#136,Quirk 2021,"",""

Women treating lung cancer: A narrative review,Tsukazan M.T.R.; ; Gelatti A.; Ugalde P.A.,"A lack of women in leadership positions is a common problem across medical specialties that treat lung cancer. Academic medicine appears to be falling behind science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in eliminating gender differences in promotion. Barriers to advancement in thoracic surgery, an essential specialty in the multidisciplinary team required to care for patients with lung cancer, include length of training, discrimination and harassment during training, difficulty balancing personal life and career, and a lack of role models. Fewer than 30% of section and division chiefs and <20% of department chairs are women. Very few women have achieved the position of full professor in a surgery department or department chairman. Addressing barriers to the academic advancement of female oncologists and thoracic surgeons may facilitate equity and improve collaborative research efforts, given the value that diversity brings to team endeavors. The quality of care and the clinical outcomes provided by women physicians are at least equivalent to those of men. There is a strong support from major international societies to increase the role of women in many specialties important to lung cancer treatment by promoting mentorship and equal career opportunities.

Women on the Frontline: A Changed Workforce and the Fight Against COVID-19,Rabinowitz L.G.; ; Rabinowitz D.G.,"COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic, with frontlines that look drastically different than in past conflicts: that is, women now make up a sizeable majority of the health care workforce. American women have a long history of helping in times of hardship, filling positions on the home front vacated by men who enlisted as soldiers during World War I and similarly serving in crucial roles on U.S. military bases, on farms, and in factories during World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a novel battleground, as the first in which women have taken center stage, not only in their roles as physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and the like, but also by serving in leadership positions and facilitating innovations in science, technology, and policy. Yet, the pandemic has exacerbated multiple pain points that have disproportionally impacted women in health care, including shortages in correctly sized personal protective equipment and uniforms, inadequate support for pregnant and breastfeeding providers, and challenges associated with work-life balance and obtaining childcare. While the pandemic has facilitated several positive advancements in addressing these challenges, there is still much work to be done for women to achieve equity and optimal support in their roles on the frontlines.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",2021,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,96,6,808EP  - 812,635155110,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004011,34031302,#139,Rabinowitz 2021,"",""

Gender differences in dentistry: A qualitative study on students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for entering dentistry at higher education,Kaersgaard J.L.B.; ; Christensen M.K.; Sondergaard P.Y.; Naukkarinen J.,"INTRODUCTION: Having a balanced gender distribution is thought to ensure the diversity of knowledge and know-how and take better into account the different needs in society. The aim of the study is to explore and understand possible gender differences in (a) the students' motivational spectrum to choose a dental education and (b) their prospect of a professional career in dentistry. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We conducted in-depth interviews with male and female dental students (n = 14) followed by a theoretical reading based on Self-Determination Theory to explore the students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for entering dentistry in Denmark. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Regardless gender, the dental students are motivated by role models, people orientation and strong interest in health sciences, but prefer dentistry to medicine, because of the responsibilities and working conditions. They were also motivated by the dental school's combination of theory and practice in students' learning of craftsmanship. Moreover, students valued the prospect of job security and a good work-life balance. However, there were markedly gender differences in motivation in relation to financial incentives as well as working life and career as a dentist, as it seemed that dental students needed gendered relatedness in relation to specialisation and employment in public versus private sector. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The motivational spectrum varies widely, regardless of gender. In line with the standpoint feminist theory, a balanced gender distribution in dental education helps to meet the different needs in society and labour market.

Gender disparities among medical students choosing to pursue careers in medical research: a secondary cross-sectional cohort analysis,Snyder A.; ; Xiang D.; Smith A.; Esswein S.; Toubat O.; Di Capua J.; Kwan J.M.; Daye D.,"BACKGROUND: Though the proportion of women in medical schools has increased, gender disparities among those who pursue research careers still exists. In this study, we seek to better understand the main factors contributing to the existing gender disparities among medical students choosing to pursue careers in medical research. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A secondary cross-sectional cohort analysis of previously published data was conducted using a 70-item survey that was sent to 16,418 medical students at 32 academic medical centers, and was IRB exempt from the need for ethical approval at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania. Data was collected from September 2012 to December 2014. Survey results were analyzed using chi-square tests and Cramer's V to determine gender differences in demographic characteristics (training stage, race/ethnicity, marital status, parental status, financial support, and parental career background), career sector choice, career content choice, specialty choice, foreseeable career obstacles, and perceptions about medical research careers. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Female respondents were more likely to be enrolled in MD-only programs, while male respondents were more likely to be enrolled in MD/PhD programs. More male students selected academia as their first-choice career sector, while more female respondents selected hospitalist as their first-choice career sector. More female respondents identified patient care and opportunities for community service as their top career selection factors, while more male respondents identified research and teaching as their top career selection factors. Student loan burden, future compensation, and work/life balance were the most reported obstacles to pursuing a career in medical research. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): There are many factors from a medical student's perspective that may contribute to the existing gender disparities in pursuing a career in medical research.

As the pandemic evolves, formal strategies should be discussed with an intersectional lens to promote equity in the workforce, including (but not limited to): (1) the inclusion of broad representation (including equal representation of women and other marginalized persons) in institutional-based pandemic response and recovery planning and decision-making; (2) an evaluation (eg, institutional-led survey) of the effect of the pandemic on work-life balance; (3) the establishment of formal dialogue (eg, workshops, training, and media campaigns) to normalize coexistence of work and caregiving responsibilities and to remove stigma of gender roles; (4) a reevaluation of workload and promotion reviews; and (5) the development of formal mentorship programs to support faculty and trainees. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We believe that a multistrategy approach needs to be considered by stakeholders (including policy-makers, institutions, and individuals) to create sustainable working conditions during and beyond this pandemic.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors",2021,/,CJC Open,3,5,627EP  - 630,2011656988,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.12.027,,#143,Banks 2021,"",""
Gender and career in cardiology-a cross-sectional study,Dettmer S.; ; Wenzel A.; Trenkwalder T.; Tiefenbacher C.; Regitz-Zagrosek V.,"Background: The proportion of women as leading physicians in cardiology in university medicine has stagnated and the share of women in senior positions in cardiology is low compared with other medical specialist fields. Here, we analyze the typical barriers for women as doctors in cardiology and point to issues that make the discipline less attractive for both genders. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In a cross-sectional study, a standardized online questionnaire was sent to 3873 members of the German Cardiac Society (DGK). Answers from 567 (278 women, 289 men) were analyzed, using comparisons between groups, correlation analyses, and tests of normal distribution. <ovid:br/>Result(s): For 47.4% of respondents (52.0%, of women; 42.8%, of men; p = 0.049), training had lasted longer than anticipated. Average monthly gross income (full-time work) differed significantly between women and men as specialists (p = 0.004) and assistant doctors (p = 0.030). Of women, 32.1% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The main arguments against a career in university medicine were an extremely competitive working climate (66.7% of women, 63.2% of men), lack of work-life balance (66.7% women, 55.3% men), and excessive workload (57.8% women, 62.5% men). As strategies to increase job attractiveness, both mentioned measures to improve the work-life balance, and the flexibility of working times and improved financial provision. Women asked for gender balance at management level (76.3% vs. 32.9% of men) and opportunities for sharing management tasks (82.4% vs. 57.9%). Flatter hierarchies were requested by more men (67.1 vs. 54.8%). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Further development of the work culture in cardiology seems necessary. In order to increase the attractiveness of the field overall and to provide equal opportunities in cardiology, more targeted support should be provided to young doctors and more flexibility introduced into work.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2021,/,Herz,46,2,150EP  - 157,2010529892,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00059-021-05027-0,33599803,#146,Dettmer 2021,"",""
Addressing gender inequities: Creation of a multi-institutional consortium of women physicians in academic emergency medicine,Lee L.K.; ; Platz E.; Klig J.; Samuels-Kalow M.E.; Temin E.S.; Nagurney J.; Marsh R.; Rouhani S.; Huancahuari N.; Dubosh N.M.; Boyle K.L.; Stack A.; Dobiesz V.A.,"Gender inequity is pervasive in medicine, including emergency medicine (EM), and is well documented in workforce representation, leadership, financial compensation, and resource allocation. The reasons for gender inequities in medicine, including academic EM, are multifactorial and include disadvantageous institutional parental, family, and promotion policies; workplace environment and culture; implicit biases; and a paucity of women physician leader role models, mentors, and sponsors. To address some of the challenges of gender inequities and career advancement for women in academic EM, we established an innovative, peer-driven, multi-institutional consortium of women EM faculty employed at four distinct hospitals affiliated with one medical school. The consortium combined financial and faculty resources to execute gender-specific programs not feasible at an individual institution due to limited funding and faculty availability. The programs included leadership skill-building and negotiation seminars for consortium members. The consortium created a collaborative community designed specifically to enrich career development for women in academic EM, with a formal organizational structure to connect faculty from four hospitals under one academic institution. The objective of this report is to describe the creation of this cross-institutional consortium focused on career development, academic productivity, and networking and sharing best practices for work-life integration for academic EM women faculty. This consortium-building model could be used to enhance existing institutional career development structures for women and other physician communities in academic medicine with unique career advancement challenges.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",2021,/,Academic Emergency Medicine,28,12,1358EP  - 1367,2013642576,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acem.14361,34331734,#147,Lee 2021,"",""
Paid Parental Leave Policies Among U.S. News 2020-2021 Best Hospitals and Best Hospitals for Cancer,Lu D.J.; ; King B.L.; Sandler H.M.; Tarbell N.J.; Kamrava M.; Atkins K.M.,"Purpose/Objective(s): The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorses 12-weeks of paid parental leave based on studies showing health benefits to parents and children. Parental leave policies can impact the distribution of child-rearing duties, which may influence gender equity and retention of women in medicine. However, there is a paucity of data describing paid parental leave for faculty/staff physicians. We sought to evaluate paid parental leave policies for physicians at top U.S. hospitals and cancer centers. Materials/Methods: Parental leave policies for the 2020-2021 U.S. News Top 20 Best Hospitals and Best Hospitals for Cancer were reviewed from publicly accessible websites, yielding 27 unique institutions. Human resources offices were contacted to verify policies. Duration of paid child-bearing and parental leave, salary support, and related provisions were obtained. Parental leave included leave available post-childbirth/disability for birthing mothers and for non-birthing mothers, partners, and adoptive parents. Paid leave was defined as receiving >=50% of base salary and excluded regular accrued paid time off (e.g., vacation). If unpaid parental leave was available (< 50% base salary), paid parental leave duration was considered to be zero. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 27 institutions, six (22%) offer longer leave and/or greater pay based on the extent of caregiving responsibility (e.g., primary vs. secondary; n = 2) or employment position (e.g., academic faculty vs. non-faculty staff physician; n = 4). The mean duration of paid leave for birthing mothers (childbirth plus parental leave) is 7.8 weeks (range, 0-14 weeks) and for parental leave is 3.6 weeks (range, 0-12 weeks), using benefits from primary caregiver and academic faculty status where institutional benefits differ. Conversely, using benefits from secondary caregiver or non-faculty status where benefits differ, the mean paid leave for birthing mothers is 6.8 weeks (range, 0-12 weeks) and for parental leave is 2.3 weeks (range, 0-8 weeks). While the majority of hospitals (n = 23, 85%) offer short-term disability for childbirth, pay varies markedly (range, 0%-100%). Four institutions (15%) do not provide paid leave for childbirth and more than half (n = 15, 56%) do not provide paid parental leave beyond childbirth (based on secondary caregiver or non-faculty status where benefits differ). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Despite AAP endorsement of 12-weeks paid parental leave given improved outcomes for parents and children, the mean duration of paid maternity and parental leave at 27 leading U.S. hospitals and cancer centers is only 7.8 weeks and 3.6 weeks, respectively, at maximal benefits estimates. Nearly one-fourth of institutions offer different leave benefits based on faculty status and/or extent of caregiving responsibility.

Career development of physicians working in hematology and oncology: First results of the DGHO online survey,Busson-Spielberger M.; ; Giesler M.; Miemietz B.,"Background: For years, the number of female medical students has been increasing: Currently, more women than men are enrolled in medicine. However, a 2019 survey by the German Medical Women's Association shows that despite the strong increase in the proportion of female physicians in the medical profession over the years, only 13 percent of C4/W3 positions with leadership roles at German medical faculties are held by women. Similar figures are reported in other studies. The fact that female physicians are less often found at higher hierarchy levels can have various causes. On the one hand, this may be due to the adoption of traditional role models. On the other hand, the experience of the difficult reconciliation of family and career may have an influence. In the future, changes in the meaning of work are also likely to increasingly influence career paths: For the current generation of young physicians, family and leisure time play a greater role than they did 20 years ago. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): In order to find out how the career development of physicians working in hematology and oncology is currently shaping up, the DGHO initiated a survey of its members. The present survey addressed the following research questions: - Which positions are held currently by physicians working in hematology and oncology? - Which positions do physicians working in hematology and oncology aspire to? - Which attributes of work are important to them (e.g., recognition by superiors, intrinsic motivation, compensation, content of work)? - What kind of working conditions do physicians in hematology and oncology prefer (especially with regard to future models of working hours and work organization)? - Which experiences of discrimination do they encounter (e.g. due to gender, migration background, social origin, age, etc.)? - Which causes for gender inequality and which obstacles to equality do they perceive? - What helped them so far to follow their career path (working time models, support from colleagues, support from superiors, support from family or partner)?

The characteristics associated with WLI are poorly understood. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To identify personal and professional factors associated with WLI in physicians and identify factors that modify the association between gender and WLI. <ovid:br/>Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional study was based on electronic and paper surveys administered October 2017 to March 2018 at private, academic, military, and veteran's practices across the US. It used a population-based sample of US physicians across all medical specialties. Data analysis was performed from November 2019 to July 2020. <ovid:br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: WLI was assessed using an 8-item scale (0-100 point scale, with higher scores indicating favorable WLI), alongside personal and professional factors. Multivariable linear regressions evaluated independent associations with WLI as well as factors that modify the association between gender and WLI. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 5197 physicians completing surveys, 4370 provided complete responses. Of the physicians who provided complete responses, 2719 were men, 3491 were White/Caucasian (80.8%), 3560 were married (82.4%), and the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (12.0) years. The mean (SD) WLI score was 55 (23). Women reported lower (worse) mean (SD) WLI scores than men overall (52 [22] vs 57 [23]; mean difference, -5 [-0.2 SDs]; P <.001). In multivariable regression, lower WLI was independently associated with being a woman (linear regression coefficient, -6; SE, 0.7; P <.001) as well as being aged 35 years or older (eg, aged 35 to 44 years: linear regression coefficient, -7; SE, 1.4; P <.001), single (linear regression coefficient, -3 vs married; SE, 1.1; P =.003), working more hours (eg, 50 to 59 hours per week vs less than 40 hours per week: linear regression coefficient, -9; SE, 1.0; P <.001) and call nights (linear regression coefficient, -1 for each call night per week; SE, 0.2; P <.001), and being in emergency medicine (linear regression coefficient, -18; SE, 1.6, P <.001), urology (linear regression coefficient, -11; SE, 4.0; P =.009), general surgery (linear regression coefficient, -4; SE, 2.0; P =.04), anesthesiology (linear regression coefficient, -4; SE, 1.7; P =.03), or family medicine (linear regression coefficient, -3; SE, 1.4; P =.04) (reference category, internal medicine subspecialties). In interaction modeling, physician age, youngest child's age, and hours worked per week modified the associations between gender and WLI, such that the largest gender disparities were observed in physicians who were aged 45 to 54 years (estimated WLI score for women, 49; 95% CI, 47-51; estimated WLI score for men, 57, 95% CI, 55-59; P <.001), had youngest child aged 23 years or older (estimated WLI score for women, 51; 95% CI, 48-54; estimated WLI score for men, 60; 95% CI, 58-62; P <.001), and were working less than 40 hours per week (estimated WLI score for women, 61; 95% CI, 59-63; estimated WLI score for men; 70; 95% CI, 68-72; P <.001). <ovid:br/>Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that lower WLI was reported by physicians who are women, single, aged 35 years or older, and who work more hours and call nights.

Factors affecting fellowship choices among us residents: A nationwide survey,Nadeem M.; ; Moon G.; Bader N.; Antunes C.,"Introduction: Despite the recognition of gender parity in medicine as crucial for creating a culture of diversity and equity, women are under-represented in the field of gastroenterology (GI). From 2007 to 2019, the total number of Internal Medicine female physicians have increased from 32% to 43 %. In GI the trend has not been the same. In fact, as of 2019, only a third of the gastroenterology trainees and 18% of practicing gastroenterologists were females. Literature is scarce on factors limiting female residents from pursuing a career in gastroenterology. To address this, we designed this nationwide survey. <ovid:br/>Method(s): 500 ACGME accredited Internal Medicine and Medicine-Pediatrics programs were identified via FREIDA database. Individual emails were sent to program directors and program coordinators starting in May 2021. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 144 residents have completed the survey until now. Demographics are shown in the figure A. Sixty-eight percent of respondents were interested in applying for a fellowship with the top 3 choices being GI (23%), Cardiology (13 %), and Pulmonary and Critical care (11%). Notably, 44 % (n564) responded that they have previously considered a career in GI but of those, only about half (n535) still have a plan to pursue. Of all the females who reported interest in GI, less than half (20 out 43) are still planning on applying for a GI fellowship. Among the factors cited by women no longer considering a career in GI are competitiveness of the fellowship, having a female mentor (70%) and exposure to GI during residency (97%) greatly impacted their career choice. Interestingly, 53% of these women didn't have any female faculty in their GI department. More than half of the total respondents perceive GI as not female-friendly and only a quarter believed that endoscopy may be more challenging for women. Three-fourths of the total participants agreed that there is a need for more women in GI. Having a supportive partner, paid maternity leaves, work-life balance, financial security, proximity to family, and student loans were highlighted as some of the major factors that affect career choices in women. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from our nationwide survey shows that .50% females who had interest in GI will not pursue a Gastroenterology fellowship career.

Why don't more women choose cardiology interviews with female internal medicine residents,Logan J.; ; Tummala L.; Arundel C.; Hopkins H.; Chretien K.,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, about 43% of third year medicine residents were women, but only 26% of cardiology first year fellows were female. Given lack of data on the transition from residency to fellowship, we sought to understand what barriers preclude female medicine residents from pursuing cardiology fellowships. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of female medicine residents regarding cardiology. Female medicine residents from five local training institutions were recruited by email. A female medicine attending consented and interviewed each volunteer. The interview was about 75 minutes and addressed career and personal goals, experiences with cardiology, and gender inequities. Notes were taken and the interviewer summarized the main participant's responses as a form of member checking. The research team discussed and analyzed interview notes for themes using an iterative process. This study was approved by the local IRB. It was closed early due to the COVID pandemic. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Five PGY2 residents from two different programs were interviewed. Seven themes were identified: mentoring, research support, the impact of fellows on resident experience, negative perceptions of cardiology, sexually offensive comments and behavior, the gender pay gap and work- life balance. The need for facilitated mentoring and research were major themes. Many of the female residents described a desire to pursue cardiology in medical school but were unable to find mentors in residency. The residents' perceptions of cardiology were consistently unfavorable. A lack of teaching, older and largely male faculty, and unwelcoming fellows contributed to this perception. The residents interviewed were aware of how gender impacted their career. They described being perceived as less competent than male colleagues and being subjected to inappropriate behavior by patients. The female residents struggled with the anticipated pay gap, being judged for childbearing and unequal balance of work at home. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): In this qualitative study exploring gender disparities in cardiology, we identified potential barriers and opportunities. Several themes have previously been identified in the literature including lack of mentorship. Our findings indicate that there is still work to be done to match female residents with mentors and research opportunities, which might be helped by partnerships across institutions. Fellows play a key role in residency training and should be encouraged to mentor residents. The themes of sexual harassment and the gender pay gap provide areas for educational interventions to equip female residents with the tools to combat harassment and skills related to financial literacy. The major limitation of this study is small sample size.

Mission (im)possible: Fulfilling Career for Women in Science,Holzer Ljubojevic S.; ,"Even in western societies that stress the importance of gender equality, women are underrepresented in most senior-level positions, including the academic ones. For instance, recent estimates indicate that women comprise less than 20% of full professors in the natural sciences in the western world. Finding an acceptable balance between career and family is a difficult challenge for many women in academic world. Careers in academia demand a skewed focus on one's research portfolio, long hours at work or traveling to meetings, all while running the household and caring for the children. In trying to balance personal and professional responsibilities, female researchers and physicians face a difficult task in striving to 'have it all.' Here, an integrated summary of previous research on attrition and persistence of female graduates will shed light on particular obstacles faced by women in postdoctoral academics and direct attention to ways in which women themselves, policy-makers and those involved in career development can work to improve the persistence rates, experiences, and diversity of the future faculty. Specifically, researchers at different stages of their career (i.e., PhD students, early career researchers and those who are starting their journey as independent group leaders) are invited to discuss (1) why so few women hold the top roles in academia, (2) what internal vs. external factors lead to the underrepresentation of women in academic medicine and (3) what we can do to counterbalance the existing challenges.

The objective of this study was to develop and pilot test a survey instrument to characterize the unique needs of women in medicine surrounding fertility and family building which may contribute to academic disparities and attrition. <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative data were collected from standardized 1:1 interviews with female physicians. Interviews explored perceptions and experiences of fertility, pregnancy, parenthood, and the impact of family planning on career trajectory. Data were coded in Dedoose and used to develop a tailored survey that assesses demographics, partner status, career path, family planning, delayed childbearing, and infertility using multiple choice items and Likert-type scales. Attitudes and knowledge regarding age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation were also assessed. A panel of psychologists and REIs evaluated the survey for content validity. Initial psychometric evaluation was conducted iteratively among female physicians to assess response distribution, clarity, sensitivity, and depth. Feedback from pilot participants informed further revisions and modifications to the survey. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Twenty-four female physicians including 6 trainees and 18 attending physicians from academic, community, and private practice settings completed the pilot survey (mean age = 36.1 years, SD = 6.65, range = 28-56 years).

Women in Neurosurgery: From a Matter of Fortuitous Occasions Toward a Conscious Choice,Graziano F.; ; Gerardi R.M.; Scalia G.; Cammarata G.; Nicoletti G.F.; Chaurasia B.; Umana G.E.,"Background: Medicine has made progress toward gender equality and has achieved almost equal distribution between men and women among graduates. However, more still needs to be done because most surgical subspecialties are still lacking adequate female representation and this persisting gender gap is particularly evident in both practical neurosurgery and the academic world. Gradual advancements have enabled a few women to pursue a successful career in neurologic surgery, pairing clinical practice with mentoring and involvement in academic research. These efforts show that more needs to be done to bridge the historic and current gap, which has recently aroused increasing interest among the neurosurgical community through internationally relevant studies. In neurosurgical societies worldwide, the existence of gender-related issues and women-reserved sections has started to attract attention and recognition on how to properly address this issue among present and future neurosurgeons. <ovid:br/>Method(s): In this study, we discuss the timeline of women's road to gaining their place in neurosurgery, inspired by Hippocrates' motto ""Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future."" Although neurosurgery had been traditionally considered too difficult a subject in which to engage, the first female neurosurgeons challenged themselves in this field, previously reserved only for men, at a time when society was not yet ready to embrace women's presence. Their successes paved the way for future generations of women, progressively shedding light on complex themes such as peer considerations, difficulty in reaching academic positions, and work-life balance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Our aim is to analyze the historic reasons for inequality among men and women, which might be found in the themes of personal choice and willingness, aside from cultural bias or stereotypically based thinking. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Accordingly, if the difference in numbers were considered a reality related to personal inclination, perhaps, nobody would pay attention to this topic and the presence of even a few women in neurosurgery would be considered less strange. By thinking along those lines on a daily basis, we could all simply write about the history of valuable neurosurgeons in the past, present, and future without any distinction between men and women.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,World Neurosurgery,148,"(Graziano, Gerardi, Cammarata) Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences, and Advanced Diagnostics, Institute of Neurosurgery, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy(Umana) Department of Neurosurgery, Trauma Center, Gamma Knife Center, Cannizzaro Hospital, ",129EP  - 135,2011078461,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.01.049,33515798,#158,Graziano 2021,"",""
"Work, life, and the gender effect: Perspectives of ACVIM Diplomates in 2017. Part 1-Specialty demographics and measures of professional achievement",Morello S.L.; ; Colopy S.A.; Chun R.; Buhr K.A.,"Background: Barriers to achieving work-life balance, as well as gender-based differences, exist in the male-dominated surgical specialty in veterinary medicine. Similar information does not exist for the more feminized American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). Hypothesis/Objectives: To provide data on the professional and personal lives of Diplomates of the ACVIM so as to help define the state of the specialty, including gender-related differences, and identify areas requiring intervention to improve work-life balance. Sample: A total of 896 surveys (781 completed) of Diplomates of the ACVIM, including cardiology, large animal internal medicine, neurology, oncology, and small animal internal medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An 82-item online survey was distributed in February 2017 to ACVIM Diplomates via their respective ACVIM listserv. Participation was voluntary. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Thirty percent of the total ACVIM registered membership responded and 26% completed surveys; 25% were men and 75% were women. Specialists in academia worked significantly more hours, with larger numbers of diplomates per specialty section, and made less money compared with those in private practice. Women were less likely to report full-time employment, practice ownership, or higher academic rank, and reported 20% lower income overall (after adjustment for relevant factors) as compared with men. Men and women differed in their subjective assessment of the effect of gender in the workplace. Eighty-three percent of respondents were somewhat satisfied or better with their career.

The Podiatric Medical Profession: A Gender Comparison,Brower B.A.; ; Butterworth M.L.; Crawford M.E.; Jennings M.M.; Tan Z.; Moore J.D.; Suzuki S.; Carpenter B.B.,"The number of women in podiatric medicine and surgery has increased steadily over the past 4 decades; however, there appears to be a large and continued gender gap with respect to representation in academic medicine and other positions of power. National and state level organizational data were obtained from multiple podiatry professional societies to evaluate the rate at which women achieved leadership roles within the podiatric profession over time. A secondary questionnaire was also developed and electronically mailed to 8684 doctors of podiatric medicine to help capture additional leadership information and to provide further insight into the trends observed. The response rate was 26% (2276/8684). Female representation in academia, research/publications, most leadership positions, and board certifications has increased over time, but at a slower rate than the number of women entering the profession. We observed a decreasing trend of females completing fellowships, speaking at national meetings, becoming residency directors, and receiving American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons- and American Podiatric Medical Association-sponsored grants/awards. Based on the survey results, female podiatric physicians were more likely to be single, have fewer children, spend more time in a clinical setting, be less satisfied with work, and experience higher work stress levels than their male colleagues. Of the female respondents, 73% described experiencing gender discrimination at some point in their career, and 42% reported experiencing sexual harassment, compared with only 6% and 5% of men, respectively.

Energizing the Conversation: How to Identify and Overcome Gender Inequalities in Academic Medicine,Sakowski S.A.; ; Feldman E.L.; Jagsi R.; Singer K.,"Gender inequality exists in advanced faculty and leadership positions at academic medical centers; however, despite growing awareness, how to best approach and rectify the issue is unknown. To energize the conversation on gender inequality at one academic medical center, chairs and women faculty were surveyed to identify barriers faced by women navigating their careers. A symposium with short talks to increase awareness, a panel with University leaders to discuss issues and successful strategies to overcome gaps, and focus groups to delve further into key areas that underlie inequity through an active cafe style format were planned and implemented. This multifaceted approach resulted in a wealth of knowledge. The symposium and panel highlighted important relevant issues and offered personal strategies for successful career advancement, while the focus group discussions further identified barriers and inspired ongoing efforts across departments and novel approaches to overcome three key issues (work-life integration, deliberate promotion of mentor/sponsor relationships, and overcoming unconscious bias) identified through the initial surveys. Compiled data were then disseminated to participants and University leaders to enhance awareness of available programs and prompt action in critical areas lacking support. Overall, the approach indicated that securing support from leaders and the academic community alike are pertinent to emphasize actions needed to overcome issues affecting women in academic medicine. Moreover, bringing leaders and faculty together for an informational session and brainstorming appears to energize the conversation. Such efforts can ultimately instill change and establish an inclusive environment where all members of the academic medicine community can thrive.",2020,/,The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,40,4,274EP  - 278,633617224,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000296,33284179,#162,Sakowski 2020,"",""
Turnover among Australian general practitioners: a longitudinal gender analysis,Bardoel E.A.; ; Russell G.; Advocat J.; Mayson S.; Kay M.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about gender differences in general practitioner (GP) turnover. It is important to understand potential divergence given both the feminization of the Australian GP workforce and projected shortages of GPs. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): There is increasing evidence that national health outcomes are related to the extent to which health care systems incorporate high quality primary care. Quality primary care is, in turn reliant on a stable general practice (GP) workforce. With the increasing feminization of medical schools, we sought to identify correlates of turnover in the GP workforce, separately for women and men, focusing particularly on part-time employment and child-rearing, and distinguishing effects related to either planned or unplanned turnover. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Annual responses from cohorts of at least 1900 women GPs and 2000 men GPs are used for up to eight waves of the Medicine in Australia-Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. Descriptive and bivariate correlations are provided. Random effects ordered logit is applied to dependent variables for turnover intentions measuring intent to ""leave direct care"" or ""leave medicine"". A behavioral measure of turnover is used in random effects logit regressions, with the exclusion or inclusion of the confounding intentions variables revealing correlates of unplanned or planned turnover. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Part-time employment is associated with turnover intentions among both women (84% or 94% increase in the odds ratios or ORs) and particularly men (414% or 672%), and with actual turnover for women (150% or 49%) and for men (160% or 107%). Women GPs engage in more unplanned turnover than men: they are 85% more likely to engage in turnover after controlling for intentions. Unplanned turnover is concentrated among women below 40 years of age and with young children, even though both groups report below average turnover intentions. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): Although further studies are needed to identify specific factors associated with GP turnover among women, the analysis highlights the need to focus on women GPs who are either young or have young children. Given the substantial personal and social investment required to produce GPs, it is wasteful to lose so many young women early in their careers.",2020,/,Human resources for health,18,1,99,633725177,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00525-4,33298049,#163,Bardoel 2020,"",""

340 Sex-Based Barriers to the Advancement of Women in Academic Emergency Medicine: A Multi-Institutional Survey Study,Graham E.M.; ; Ferrel M.; Wells K.; Egan D.J.; MacVane C.Z.; Gisondi M.A.; Burns B.D.; Madsen T.E.; Fix M.L.,"Study Objectives: The number of leadership positions held by women within academic medicine remain stagnant despite an increasing number of women entering medicine and in faculty positions. Exploring the unique experiences and challenges faced by women in emergency medicine may provide a framework in which to support and train future leaders. The objective of this multi-institutional survey study was to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect the career trajectories of women in academic emergency medicine. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An IRB-approved, electronic survey was distributed to women faculty members in emergency medicine at eight institutions across the United States. Anonymous responses were collected between November 2019 and January 2020. Survey items assessed five domains: determination, resiliency, career support and obstacles, career aspiration, and sex discrimination. Response options utilized a Likert 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) and analyzed using two-sided t-tests. Responses for each question and category were averaged and deemed significant if the average was greater than or equal to 4 in the affirmative, or less than or equal to 2 in the negative. Additionally, we compared junior faculty (<10 years in practice) and senior faculty (>/=10 years in practice). Demographic questions and others reported as proportions were reassigned into binary format and analyzed using z-score calculations. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 109 eligible faculty, 59 participated in the study (54.1% response rate) and 32 were senior faculty members. Years in practice ranged from < 5 years to 35-40 years with a median interval of 10-14 years. Significant findings include a positive categorical average for resiliency, with an average of 4.02. Career obstacles include a lack of confidence during negotiations, with only 27% (16/59) reporting confidence discussing salary, benefits, and promotions. Childbearing and child rearing were not considered significant barriers in career advancement. Of the respondents, 96.6% (57/59) disagreed that being a woman is advantageous in medicine with an average of 2.00. Additionally, 76% (45/59) of participants reported sex discrimination by colleagues or supervisors, and 15% (7/45) of those individuals also reported at least one sexual assault and/or battery by colleagues or supervisors during their careers. Senior faculty were more likely than junior faculty to relocate to advance their careers (p=0.010), to sacrifice career advancement for family (p=0.040), to have been PI of a research study project (19 vs. 7), and to have received a grant (11 vs 7). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In this multicenter survey of women emergency medicine faculty, high levels of resiliency likely contribute to career advancement. Difficulty with negotiation and sex discrimination are experienced commonly.

The role of gender in selecting internal medicine trainees in Canada,Katz S.; ,"Background: In Canada, medical students must enter the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) to match to a post graduate training program. Most programs will select medical students for interviews for available positions based on a standard file the student submits. The standard for selection is established by each program itself. While gender bias in medicine, including physician training, has been well described <ovid:sup>2,3</ovid:sup>, less is known about gender bias in the selection process for post graduate residency training programs. <ovid:br/>Aim(s): This analysis reviews the potential role of gender on the file review component of post graduate trainee selection for an internal medicine residency program in Canada. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Each applicant's file is reviewed by two staff physicians independently, with the total score used to rank applicants for interview offers. Scoring is based on an internally constructed rubric examining file components such as rotation electives in internal medicine, research, community work, leadership, work-life balance, letters of reference, a personal letter and an overall opinion of the reviewer. For this study, overall and component scores were analyzed based on the gender of the applicant from the 2019 CaRMS match at the University of Alberta Core Internal Medicine post graduate training program. File review scores were further analyzed based on the staff physician reviewer's gender. <ovid:br/>Result(s): There were 378 applicants to the Core Internal Medicine residency program in 2019, of which 165 were female (43.65%) and 213 (56.35%) were male. There was a total of 26 file reviewers, 15 of whom were female and 11 were male. Average file review scores for female applicants equaled 23.618, compared to 22.699 for male applicants (P = 0.0056). However, there was no statistically significant difference in subcomponents of the scores except when comparing leadership in the arts, where significantly more female applicants demonstrated aptitude in this area compared to males (N = 79 vs 63, P = 0.0019). Gender of the file reviewer did appear to impact scoring. Scores given by male reviewers were significantly lower than female reviewers (22.494 vs 23.493, P = 0.0148). Further analysis to determine if reviewer gender impacted scoring of applicants based on applicant gender demonstrated no difference. Male reviewer scores demonstrated no significant difference between applicant gender (female 23.147 vs male 22.011, P = 0.141), with similar results for female reviewers (female 23.948 vs male 23.128, P = 0.107). The top 180 applicants were offered an interview, representing 98 male applicants (54.4%) and 82 female applicants (45.5%), proportions which are not significantly different than the original applicant group (P = 0.752). <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Female applicants obtained higher file review scores compared to male applicants, although this did not result in proportionally more women being offered an interview compared to men.

Retention of women in academic medicine and effects of mentorship,Onumah C.; ; Cioletti A.; Wikstrom S.,"BACKGROUND: Despite entering medical school and academic medicine at higher rates, rates of women faculty are not commensurate with men. Literature has shown that women leave or intend to leave academic medicine for multiple reasons. Gender leadership gaps in academic medicine are well documented in the literature more-so than gender gaps in retention. Lack of women in leadership roles equates to lack of female role models and potential losses related to organizational effectiveness given the importance of diversity within teams and organizations. To address the gender gaps in leadership in academic medicine, we must address the leaky pipeline. The goal of the study is to provide descriptive information regarding relationships between specific institutional factors and interventions and women's intent to remain in academic medicine. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): To better identify what factors are associated with women's retention or intent to remain in academic medicine, we surveyed women faculty with appointments in U.S. Departments of Medicine. The survey consisted of a series of questions rated on a Likert scale, demographic questions, and qualitative write- in questions derived from the literature. Participants voluntarily completed the survey by links posted on public listservs. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), descriptive and discriminant analyses were performed. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): At the close of the survey, 429 survey responses analyzed after removing incomplete surveys and respondents that that did not meet inclusion criteria. The sample included women faculty across all ranks, across all regions, and various ethnicities. The largest number of responses were from women in general internal medicine. Of the participants, 43% were satisfied with the current level of mentorship provided at their institution. More participants agreed if there was a formal mentorship program at their institution, but rates were lower if it was through an outside program or formal peer mentorship. Institutional interventions to address gender inequities varied. A number of factors were found to have a positive association with intention to remain in academic medicine including opportunities to integrate work and life identities, flexible work options, paid parental leave, and professional development. Over 80% of women responding plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): While gender bias training for leaders and committee members and faculty development programs may be important steps in addressing gender inequities in academic medicine, these initiatives alone are unlikely to fix the leaky pipeline. Despite the lower rates of women climbing the leadership ladder, most are satisfied with their current opportunities of formal mentorship and plan to stay in academic medicine over the next five years.

Burnout Among Women Physicians: a Call to Action,Chesak S.S.; ; Cutshall S.; Anderson A.; Pulos B.; Moeschler S.; Bhagra A.,"Purpose of Review: The purposes of this discussion are to describe what is known about burnout among women physicians and identify contributing factors, categories of impact, and methods for mitigating the phenomenon. The authors conclude with current gaps in research. Recent Findings: Although there are a lack of investigations analyzing and reporting physician burnout data by gender, there is evidence to suggest that women physicians experience stress and burnout differently than their men counterparts. Women physicians are more likely to face gender discrimination, gender biases, deferred personal life decisions, and barriers to professional advancement, all of which may contribute to burnout. <ovid:br/>Summary: Interventions specific to preventing physician burnout in women should include (1) addressing barriers to career satisfaction, work life integration, and mental health; (2) identification and reduction of gender and maternal bias; (3) mentorship and sponsorship opportunities; (4) family leave, lactation, and child care policies and support.

Gender differences in perceptions of departmental culture in academic emergency medicine,Madsen T.E.; ; Baird J.; Ledoux M.B.; Lall M.D.; Linden J.A.; Rounds K.L.; Sethuraman K.; Choo E.,"Background and Objectives: Departmental culture can greatly impact a woman's career success in academic medicine. Recognizing factors that contribute to a supportive culture is necessary to establish gender parity. This study aimed to measure differences in experienced culture between men and women in academic emergency medicine (EM) Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of academic EM faculty. Administrators of all U.S. academic departments of EM (identified via the Academy for Administrators in Academic EM) were asked to distribute the study invitation to their faculty by email. The survey included the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS), a validated instrument for evaluating culture in academic medicine. Domains measured included equal access (19 items), work-life balance (11 items), freedom from biases (5 items), and chair support (12 items). Items were scored with 5-point Likert scales; lower scores indicate more negative experiences. A single burnout question was also included. Multiple imputation was used to estimate missing data. We calculated total and unadjusted mean scores with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by gender, for the overall scale and for each domain. Multiple linear regression was used to compare overall CCWAS and domain scores by gender, adjusted for age, race, geographic region, and level of burnout Results: Of 260 respondents from 31 departments, 41% were women. Most participants were 35-44 years old (41%) or 45-54 years old (25%). In terms of race/ ethnicity, 77% were white/non-Hispanic, 3% black, 11% Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 3% other. Women had lower mean total score (women: 162.7 (SD 32.9) vs. men: 180.2 (SD 31.6), p=0.001). Average adjusted scores for men were 10.8 points higher than women on the overall CCWAS (95%CI 4.4-17.2), p=0.001. Compared to women, mean adjusted scores for men were 3.6 points (95%CI 0.6-6.6) higher for equal access (p=0.02), 3.3 points higher (95%CI 1.7-4.9) for work-life balance (p<0.0001), 2.1 points higher (95%CI 1.1-3.1) for bias management (p<0.0001), and 1.8 points higher (95% CI -0.2-3.8) for chair support (p=0.07) <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In a national sample of academic EM faculty, women reported more negative academic culture scores compared to men.

Empowering Women Researchers in the New Century: IADR's Strategic Direction,Ioannidou E.; ; Letra A.; Shaddox L.M.; Teles F.; Ajiboye S.; Ryan M.; Fox C.H.; Tiwari T.; D'Souza R.N.,"Gender inequality in science, medicine, and dentistry remains a central concern for the biomedical research workforce today. Although progress in areas of inclusivity and gender diversity was reported, growth has been slow. Women still face multiple challenges in reaching higher ranks and leadership positions while maintaining holistic success in these fields. Within dental research and academia, we might observe trends toward a more balanced pipeline. However, women continue to face barriers in seeking leadership roles and achieving economic equity and scholarship recognition. In an effort to evaluate the status of women in dental research and academia, the authors examined the role of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR), a global research organization, which has improved awareness on gender inequality. The goal of this article is to review five crucial issues of gender inequality in oral health research and academics-workforce pipeline, economic inequality, workplace harassment, gender bias in scholarly productivity, and work-life balance-and to discuss proactive steps that the IADR has taken to promote gender equality. Providing networking and training opportunities through effective mentoring and coaching for women researchers, the IADR has developed a robust pipeline of women leaders while promoting gender equality for women in dental academia through a culture shift. As knowledge gaps remained on the levels of conscious and unconscious bias and sexist culture affecting women advancement in academics, as well as the intersectionality of gender with race, gender identity, ability status, sexual orientation, and cultural backgrounds, the IADR has recognized that further research is warranted.",2019,/,Advances in dental research,30,3,69EP  - 77,629919495,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022034519877385,31746653,#173,Ioannidou 2019,"",""
Female Neurosurgeons in Europe-On a Prevailing Glass Ceiling,Wolfert C.; ; Rohde V.; Mielke D.; Hernandez-Duran S.,"Background: Almost one half of currently practicing physicians in Europe are women. Despite advances in access to training positions and the entry of women into neurosurgery, it has remained a male-dominated field, with an underrepresentation of female leaders. We designed a 2-part study to better understand the current situation of European female neurosurgeons. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The European Association of Neurosurgical Societies and its member societies were analyzed for female participation in leadership positions. Additionally, an online survey was designed, containing 33 questions about career choice, mentorship, family planning, and perceived obstacles, for women in neurosurgery. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 116 responses were received. Most female neurosurgeons lacked same-gender role models (76%), although most reported that having a female mentor would be important (58%). An overwhelming majority (86%) believe family planning takes on a more important role for women, and 72% reported worrying their career prospects could be negatively affected by their desire to have children. The greatest obstacle perceived was the prevailing inequality in opportunities (30%) and attaining leadership positions (24%). Most (81%) reported that women have different concerns regarding their career from men, and 72% also reported feeling at a disadvantage as a woman. Most (66%) also believe should be a ""Women in Neurosurgery"" committee within the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Unfortunately, a gender gap still exists in European neurosurgery.

Barriers Pushed Aside: Insights on Career and Family Success from Women Leaders in Academic Otolaryngology,Meyer T.K.; ; Bergmark R.; Zatz M.; Sardesai M.G.; Litvack J.R.; Starks Acosta A.,"Objective: Although the literature adequately identifies the current gender inequality that exists in academic otolaryngology and describes the barriers to advancement of women in academic medicine, there is little information regarding the daily details of how successful women in academic otolaryngology achieve work-life balance. This study was designed to better understand how women in academic otolaryngology achieve work-life balance while negotiating family and childrearing commitments, clinical workload, and scholarly activity, as well as to highlight coping strategies and behaviors that women have used to achieve these successes. <ovid:br/>Study Design: Qualitative research design. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirteen successful women in academic otolaryngology with children were recruited using a networking/snowball sampling methodology to participate in a semistructured qualitative interview about the daily process of work-life balance in an academic otolaryngology practice.

Becoming obese in young adulthood: the role of career-family pathways in the transition to adulthood for men and women,Mooyaart J.E.; ; Liefbroer A.C.; Billari F.C.,"BACKGROUND: During the transition to adulthood many young adults become obese for the first time in their lives, yet relatively little research has examined why people in this life phase become obese. This study examines what career and family life-course pathways during the transition to adulthood are related to developing obesity in young adulthood. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We use data from the NLSY97, a U.S. nationally representative panel survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics between 1997 to 2013 (N = 4688), and apply multichannel sequence analysis in order to identify clusters of typical career-family pathways during the transition to adulthood (age 17 to 27), and subsequently investigate whether these pathways are associated with becoming obese at the end of young adulthood (age 28), using logistic regression. We control for obesity at age 17 and family background factors (race, parental education, parental income, and family structure). To take into account the fact that the transition to adulthood has a different meaning for men and for women, we also interact career-family clusters with gender. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): For women, pathways characterized by college education, early home leaving, and postponement of family formation decrease the probability of becoming obese.

Women in Cardiology in Australia-Are We Making Any Progress?,Segan L.; ; Vlachadis Castles A.,"Women remain largely under-represented in cardiology worldwide, despite gender parity among medical graduates. This is particularly notable in procedural subspecialties such as interventional cardiology and electrophysiology and is consistent at all levels of training. Cardiology continues to have the lowest proportion of females of all adult medicine specialties. This is a review of existing literature and statistics pertaining to women in cardiology and highlights the relative paucity of data or publications within Australia. Australian data from the Medical Training Review Panel reported that the proportion of females in cardiology advanced training (~22%) has not changed over the last 9 years and that there is a significant attrition as trainees progress through the various stages of training. In 2018, females represent only 16% of first year cardiology advanced trainees in Victoria and Tasmania. This represents a decrease from 20-25% in previous years. The factors affecting gender parity in cardiology are complex and diverse, from personal reasons such as family planning, work-life balance and perceived gender bias, to recruitment inertia and an imbalance in opportunities for career progression, research, financial remuneration and leadership positions. Worldwide, a number of initiatives have been explored to address the gender divide in cardiology, including networking and mentorship programs and Women in Cardiology working groups, dedicated to addressing the issue of female under-representation in cardiology. Unfortunately, the progress we are seeing worldwide is not being realised in Australia. A collaborative approach is essential to achieve gender parity in cardiology. This involves introspection and accountability by College bodies and policy changes committed to promoting workplace diversity by welcoming and retaining female talent. We must recognise and address the current barriers and support women pursuing a career in cardiology.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",2019,/,Heart Lung and Circulation,28,5,690EP  - 696,2001541819,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2018.12.010,30738714,#177,Segan 2019,"",""
Women and men in the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine: workforce survey,Bezak E.; ; Suchowerska R.; Claridge Mackonis E.; Pillen H.; Ralston A.; Haworth A.; Suchowerska N.,"A survey was designed to determine aspirations, motivations and workplace experiences of both female and male members of the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). The survey collected both quantitate and qualitative data, including open ended questions. This paper reports the survey's qualitative results. The research was approved by Ethics at University of South Australia and endorsed by ACPSEM. All 205 women (30% of total membership) and 440 men were invited to complete the survey online. The data for the qualitative analysis were responses to open-ended questions within the survey. 102 women and 150 men completed surveys were received, with 66 surveys analysed, before data saturation was reached. The survey revealed a number of themes that reflect concerns and opportunities identifying the direction for improving work-life balance and gender equity within the medical physics profession in Australasia. Issues around managing challenging workloads and professional development were amplified for women with children and child-rearing responsibilities, directly contributing to a reduction in work capacity and a reorientation of work-life priorities. The survey provides direction for strategies to improve work-life balance and enable equitable engagement in the profession. The first is to identify and develop role models that actively model successful work-life balance and flexibility in gender roles and in professional conduct. The second is to improve the management skills of current and emerging administrators, advocating for improved work conditions for medical physics professionals at an organisation level. Finally, efforts need to be made to establish flexible professional development and career progression opportunities amongst those that are unable to commit to large workloads, which is common for those with child-rearing responsibilities. The realisation of these strategic goals will reduce the identified barriers to full female participation in the workforce, and shift gender-based subcultures within the workplace.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",2019,/,Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,42,1,33EP  - 41,624764165,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13246-018-0706-z,30390212,#178,Bezak 2019,"",""

Gender differences affecting fellowship and job selection have been identified in other fields of medicine. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The objective of this study was to understand gender differences in pediatric urology fellowship and job selection and how they may affect the workforce. Study design: A 47-question electronic survey consisting of questions regarding demographics, residency training, and factors influencing fellowship and job selection was distributed to current fellows and recent graduates in pediatric urology in May 2017. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A total of 111 recent and current fellows were contacted, and 72% completed the survey (55% female [F] and 45% male [M]; 61% current fellows and 39% recent fellows). Respondents rated factors important in choosing pediatric urology on a scale of 1-5 (1, not important and 5, extremely important), and the top three for both genders were 1-working with children, 2-influential mentors, and 3-bread and butter cases such as inguinal orchiopexy. During residency, 93% of respondents reported having influential mentors in pediatric urology. However, mentorship was more important in fellowship choice for males than females (3.6 F, 4.1 M; P-value = 0.048), and 45% reported having only male mentors. Rating factors important in job choice on a scale of 1-5, respondents reported the top factors as 1-rapport with partners/mentorship (4.5), 2-geography/family preferences (4.3), and 3-participation in mentoring/teaching (3.8). Although most job selection criteria were rated similarly between genders, females rated call schedule higher than males (3.5 F, 2.9 M, P-value = 0.009). Although most females and males (79% of F, 78% of M, P-value = 0.868) sought primarily academic positions, a smaller proportion of females accepted academic positions (52% of F, 72% of M, P-value 0.26), and females reported lower satisfaction regarding the availability of jobs on a scale of 1-5 (1, very dissatisfied and 5, very satisfied; 3.1 F, 3.7 M; P-value = 0.034), particularly in academic positions (3.1 F, 3.7 M; P-value = 0.06).

Results of the British Society of Gastroenterology supporting women in gastroenterology mentoring scheme pilot,Smith K.H.; ; Hallett R.J.; Wilkinson-Smith V.; Neild P.J.; Brooks A.J.; Lockett M.J.; Thomas-Gibson S.; Eaden J.A.; Edwards C.,"Introduction Mentorship has long been recognised as beneficial in the business world and has more recently been endorsed by medical and academic professional bodies. Recruitment of women into gastroenterology and leadership roles has traditionally been difficult. The Supporting Women in Gastroenterology network developed this pilot scheme for female gastroenterologists 5 years either side of the Completion Certificate of Specialist Training (CCST) to examine the role that mentorship could play in improving this discrepancy. Method Female gastroenterology trainees and consultant gastroenterologists within 5 years either side of CCST were invited to participate as mentees. Consultant gastroenterologists of both genders were invited to become mentors. 35 pairs of mentor:mentees were matched and completed the scheme over 1 year. Training was provided. Results The majority of the mentees found the sessions useful (82%) and enjoyable (77%), with the benefit of having time and space to discuss professional or personal challenges with a gastroenterologist who is not a colleague. In the longitudinal study of job satisfaction, work engagement, burnout, resilience, self-efficacy, self-compassion and work-life balance, burnout scale showed a small but non significant improvement over the year (probably an effect of small sample size). Personal accomplishment improved significantly. The main challenges were geography, available time to meet and pair matching. The majority of mentors surveyed found the scheme effective, satisfying, mutually beneficial (70%) and enjoyable (78%).

Design National cross-sectional study of randomised sample of hospital doctors. Participants provided sociodemographic data (age, sex), work grade (consultant, higher/basic specialist trainee), specialty, work hours and completed workplace well-being questionnaires (Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Scale, overcommitment, Maslach Burnout Inventory) and single item measures of work ability, presenteeism, work-life balance and desire to practise. Setting Irish publicly funded hospitals and residential institutions. Participants 1749 doctors (response rate of 55%). All hospital specialties were represented except radiology. Results 29% of respondents had insufficient work ability and there was no sex, age or grade difference. 70.6% reported strong or very strong desire to practise medicine, 22% reported good work-life balance, 82% experienced workplace stress, with effort greatly exceeding reward, exacerbated by overcommitment. Burn-out was evident in 29.7% and was significantly associated with male sex, younger age, lower years of practice, lower desire to practise, lower work ability, higher ERI ratio and greater overcommitment. Apart from the measures of work ability and overcommitment, there was no sex or age difference across any variable. However, ERI and burn-out were significantly lower in consultants than trainees.

Women in medicine mentoring and empowerment training program: A needs assessment and intervention in progress,Simone A.; ; Simone M.; Block L.; LaVine N.A.,"Needs and Objectives: Women face unique challenges throughout their careers as physicians, including disparities in salary and leadership positions. Interventions to address these issues have been made at the faculty level, however little has been done to address the same challenges for female residents. This is concerning, as many decisions determining career trajectory take place during residency. Thus, we conducted a needs assessment on gender in the workplace to establish a mentoring and empowerment training program to support female residents. Setting and Participants: A needs assessment survey was distributed amongst female internal medicine residents within the Northwell Health System. There residents were also the participants in our focus group and ongoing training program. Description: A targeted needs assessment, a combination of 3 validated surveys on workplace/gender culture, burnout and empowerment was sent to female residents. Surveys were sent to 60 female residents, and to date we have a 30% response rate. Preliminary Results show that 69% of respondents felt that women had fewer opportunities for professional development at work than men, 69% felt that men receive more organizational support than women, and 87% stated they would like to receive more support in the workplace. Data collection still is ongoing. These early Results reveal an opportunity to provide support and professional development to our female trainees. A focus group of five female trainees identified a need for a ""safe-space"" to discuss issues specific to being female residents. Participants identified desired topics, including negotiation, leading an effective team, work-life integration, public speaking, self-advocacy and addressing microaggressions and gender bias in the workplace. Based on this preliminary data, we developed a 6-session mentoring and empowerment training program for female internal medicine residents. Each session includes a learner-centered workshop on a topic from the focus group, and time for mentoring. Sessions are held at the hospital after working hours for ease of attendance. Evaluation: Three workshops have been held, with attendance ranging from 5-15 participants. Pre-and post-workshop surveys focused on perceived knowledge and comfort with topics covered will be given at each session, the Results of which are forthcoming. The needs assessment survey will be repeated at the end of the year to reassess participant's sense of support and opportunity for career advancement. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Our needs assessment shows a need amongst female residents for a place to receive support and career training.

Gender Equity and Career Advancement: Implications for Hospice and Palliative Medicine (TH352),Johnson K.S.; ; O'Mahony S.; Chen H.; Hingle S.; Moyer D.,"Objectives: *Describe disparities in the experience of female physicians compared to their male counterparts.*Describe specific challenges more commonly faced by female physicians and potential consequences with case examples.*Illustrate strategies for addressing gender disparities and promoting gender equity. Over the last 25 years, the proportion of physicians who are women has doubled from 17% to 36%. Furthermore, 46% of physicians in training and over half of U.S. medical students are women. While this significant increase in gender diversity has rapidly changed what the physician work force ""looks like"", there is a significant and persistent gap in the experience of female physicians. Compared to their male counterparts, studies show that female physicians are paid less across specialties and are disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positons despite their increasing representation in the physician workforce. Women may also experience lack of mentorship, workplace discrimination, gender bias, sexual harassment and challenges related to work-life integration based on their roles outside of the workplace. While gender equity is a salient issue across all specialties, efforts to improve the experience of women are especially important to the field of hospice and palliative medicine where women make up two-thirds of the total workforce, 47% of physicians, and over 60% of HPM fellows in training-proportions considerably larger than in general physician workforce. Given the important contribution of women to the field of hospice and palliative medicine not only in terms of the volume of clinical care provided but also related to leadership, education, and research, addressing gender equity is essential to efforts to ensure that the field is able to meet the demands of the growing population of seriously ill patients and their families. In this interactive session, using real life case examples, scenarios and questions submitted by the audience, experts actively involved in developing the ACP position statement on Gender Equity, will share best practices and illustrate strategies for promoting gender equity.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018",2019,/,Journal of Pain and Symptom Management,57,2,388,2001484841,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.12.079,,#185,Johnson 2019,"",""
Reducing the gender gap in academic activities: A 10- year progress report by the Japan Endocrine Society Women Endocrinologists Association (JES-We-Can),Katai M.; ; Sakurai K.; Fujita M.; Yamamoto M.; Suzuki M.H.,"The Japan Endocrine Society (JES) has the largest ratio of female membership among societies associated with Internal Medicine in Japan; half of female members are in their 20s or 30s at present. In 2009, JES organized the ""JES-We- Can"" committee to promote women's career development. To evaluate the effectiveness of JES-We-Can, we investigated the gender balance of various activities at JES in fiscal 2009 and 2017. Significant gender-differences were not observed in the acquisition rate of board-certified endocrinologists (BCEs) aged <40 y in 2009 and 2017. However, the acquisition rate of BCEs among women aged >=40 y was significantly lower than men in 2009. In 2017, the gender-difference among BCEs in this group (currently aged >=50 y) has considerably improved, but is not resolved. The acquisition rate of certificated endocrine educators (CEEs) among women was still significantly lower than men at all ages in 2017. Since the ratio of women oral speakers or poster presenters at annual academic meetings have grown to equal or surpass the membership ratio, female members make efficient contributions to JES. The numbers of women chairpersons, symposiasts, lecturers and invited speakers have increased, but remain limited. JES-We-Can was found to be effective in reducing the gender gap in academic activities at JES, but JES-We-Can should support women more intensely to raise the rate of CEEs among all ages and BCEs currently over 50 y, and to promote more women into higher positions in JES in the future. These actions are expected to introduce new and diverse perspectives into academia.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; The Japan Endocrine Society.",2019,/,Endocrine Journal,66,4,359EP  - 368,2001994806,https://dx.doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.EJ18-0501,30880294,#186,Katai 2019,"",""
"Interventions to assist career, professional and personal development for Radiation Oncologists within Gene-sisCare - Presented by Chelsie O'Connor & Annabelle Larkham",O'Connor C.; ; Weinand D.; Burke M.; Zissiadis Y.; Larkham A.; O'Brien P.,"Purpose: GenesisCare is the largest provider of radiation therapy in Australia employing almost 100 Radiation Oncologists. This scale provides unique opportunities for Radiation Oncologists to advance their clinical careers or develop skills in healthcare leadership and management. Burnout is a potential flip side risking a doctor's personal and professional life and increasingly recognised in all medical specialties. <ovid:sup>(1,2)</ovid:sup> GenesisCare commenced a Doctor Development Program in 2015 aimed to enhance the skills needed to develop personally and professionally. We endeavored to identify what our Radiation Oncologists would find meaningful in their work and their career goals including healthcare management to better inform support programs and individual coaching. Gender differences were also assessed to provide direction to engage more females in leadership positions. Methods and Materials: A survey was sent out to all Radiation Oncologists employed within GenesisCare. Questions included satisfaction with work commitments and flexibility in work-life balance. Further questions aimed to identify non-clinical aspects of a clinician's career where they would like to focus including pursuit of an academic career, being a key opinion leader as well as contribution to data strategy and protocol development. Given the large commercial resources within GenesisCare questions were asked to elicit whether doctors were interested in developing business acumen and development of leadership skills, utilising doctor development and individual mentorship programmes. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Feedback from Radiation Oncologists regarding the Doctor Development Program has been overwhelmingly positive despite the focus on what might be perceived as non-clinical skills. Survey results were able to identify Radiation Oncologists in several groups with development interests in direct clinical care streams, management streams and business development. Descriptive statistics were used for differences between male and female respondents together with the influence of age. Radiation Oncologists were already aware that opportunities to pursue development through various management streams (e.g. marketing, business development, clinical leadership) were available and this may have influenced responses. Additionally, female Radiation Oncologists were aware of a female representative in the national clinical management group potentially increasing their response to interest in leadership roles. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Radiation Oncologists have responded positively to opportunities to develop skills beyond those perceived as directly clinical. Many have indicated a long-term interest in health care management and leadership roles. Building an academic culture in a private practice environment is a key element to success in engaging many Radiation Oncologists. Providing the correct structure to enable females to take up more leadership roles is an ongoing challenge.",2019,/,Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology,63,Supplement 1,104,631724786,,,#187,O'Connor 2019,"",""
Support structures for female physicians: Motivations and barriers to gender-specific conferences and symposia,Jain S.; ; Graff S.L.; Swaroop M.; Woitowich N.C.,"Background: While nearly half of all medical school graduates are female, women remain underrepresented in the physician workforce. Conferences or symposia designed to address issues relevant to female physicians, such as gender-bias, sexual harassment, and work-life balance are one strategy to improve retention and advancement, yet, limited data exists surrounding their utility. To address this gap, we surveyed a multi-disciplinary group of female physicians to identify motivations or barriers to attendance. <ovid:br/>Method(s): An online survey instrument was distributed nationally via social media and shared by respondents. The survey assessed participants' demographics, attendance at genderspecific conferences or symposia, motivations or barriers to attendance, and perceived benefits of attendance. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Of 792 respondents, 34% had attended a conference or symposia for women in medicine, while 66% had not. Attendees were significantly more likely to hold a leadership position (68% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001), an academic faculty position (74% vs. 56%, p < 0.0001), and have received a professional accolade within the past year (42% vs. 28%, p < 0.0001). Non-attendees were significantly more likely to be the primary caregiver for children or seniors (64% vs. 56%, p = 0.042). Respondents indicated that an interest in discussion topics, a sense of community, and growth of professional network were key motivators in attendance. The majority of respondents indicated that attendance improved their self-advocacy, self-image, and leadership skills. Of those who did not attend, 5 1% were unaware of such conferences or symposia. Those who were aware, but unable to attend, cited lack of time as the major barrier to participation. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The results of this study provide preliminary data surrounding gender-specific conferences or symposia for women in medicine and highlight opportunities for increased engagement.

Student Perceptions of M.D.-Ph.D. Programs: A Qualitative Identification of Barriers Facing Prospective M.D.-Ph.D. Applicants,Kersbergen C.J.; ; Bowen C.J.; Dykema A.G.; Koretzky M.O.; Tang O.; Beach M.C.,"Phenomenon: Despite a high degree of interest in research among matriculating M.D. students, very few apply to combined M.D.-Ph.D. training programs. Even fewer of those applicants are female, leading to a gender disparity among M.D.-Ph.D. trainees. We used a qualitative approach to understand why students choose not to apply or matriculate to M.D.-Ph.D. programs. Approach: We recruited recently matriculated medical students at a private research university with a self-reported interest in academic medicine and biomedical research to participate in focus groups, in which students discussed their career and life goals, general knowledge and sources of information for M.D.-Ph.D. programs, perceived benefits and downsides, and barriers to applying to such programs. <ovid:br/>Finding(s): Twenty-two students participated in focus groups. Participants desired careers combining clinical work, research, and teaching. Students had knowledge of the structure and goals of M.D.-Ph.D. training and received information about dual-degree programs from research mentors, the Internet, and peers. Tuition remission and increased grant access were cited as benefits of M.D.-Ph.D. programs, whereas duration, perceived excessive research training, and early commitment were downsides. Perceived competitiveness, misconceptions about training, a lack of M.D.-Ph.D. program-specific advising, discouragement from applying, and duration of training all served as barriers preventing students from pursuing dual-degree training. Insights: Through this qualitative study, we identified perceptions and misconceptions that recent medical school applicants have about M.D.-Ph.D. programs. These findings suggest targetable barriers to increase applications from interested students, such as improving awareness of programs, increased accessibility of advising and resources, and addressing concerns over training length, with the goal of improving training access for aspiring physician-scientists.",2019,/,Teaching and learning in medicine,,"(Kersbergen, Bowen, Dykema, Koretzky, Tang) Medical Scientist Training Program, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States(Beach) General Internal Medicine and Berman Bioethics Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,",1EP  - 10,627414798,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10401334.2019.1598414,30983420,#189,Kersbergen 2019,"",""
Tackling the imposter phenomenon to advance women in neurology,Armstrong M.J.; ; Shulman L.M.,"Recent literature documents that women comprise an increasing proportion of the neurology workforce but still lag behind male counterparts in publications and promotion.

Another contributing factor receiving relatively little recognition is the imposter phenomenon. This review highlights recent literature on gender differences in neurology, the definition of the imposter phenomenon, and research on the imposter phenomenon in academic medicine.

Creating a leadership curriculum for women in medicine: Women in leadership development (WILD),Keenan B.; ; Montgomery A.G.; Thakkar A.; Burke C.; Crossman H.; Hemmat S.; Klepper A.; Santhosh L.,"Needs and Objectives: Though women account for nearly half of US medical students and residents, they are underrepresented at higher levels in academic medicine. A lack of structured leadership skills curricula targeting women trainees contributes to this gap. The Women in Leadership Development (WILD) curriculum was therefore developed within the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with the goal of building community and providing leadership training for women trainees hoping to launch their careers in academic medicine. Setting and Participants: WILD serves women residents and fellows at UCSF. During the first two years of programming (2017 and 2018), a total of 77 trainees within the Department of Medicine attended a daylong WILD symposium. Based on the Symposium's success, a yearly longitudinal curriculum was implemented at the GME level for the 2018-2019 academic year, serving women trainees across all specialties. Description: The WILD Symposium is a daylong course with the objectives of skill-building, mentorship, and networking. Skill sessions focus on public speaking, conflict resolution, microaggressions, and advocacy, with presenters from both inside and outside of academic medicine. This year, we have expanded WILD to include monthly skill-building sessions for women trainees across specialties ("" WILD: Series"") as well as quarterly events for trainees within the Department of Medicine focused on networking and community building ("" WILD: IM""). Evaluation: Prior to implementation of the WILD Symposium, we conducted a needs assessment to survey women residents about their interest in a leadership course. 93% had some level of interest. Topic areas of interest included negotiation, CV development, self-promotion, communication, networking, work-life balance, and the art of ""saying no."" Of 77 participants surveyed after the event, over 90% agreed that participation in the symposium was a useful experience and would strongly recommend the session to other trainees. The public speaking session received the highest reviews.

Perceptions of Parenting Residents Among Family Medicine Residency Directors,Morris L.E.; ; Lindbloom E.; Kruse R.L.; Washington K.T.; Cronk N.J.; Paladine H.L.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Parenting during residency is increasingly common, and resident parents face unique demands on their time and emotional and cognitive resources. Physicians at all levels of training perceive negative impacts of parenting on career and family life. Surveys of program directors (PDs) in other specialties reveal concern about performance and quality of life of parenting residents. The primary aims of this study were to examine family medicine PDs' perceptions of parenting residents' performance and the adequacy of parenting support structures. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): Data were collected from the 2017 Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM) Educational Research Alliance (CERA) Family Medicine Residency Program Directors survey.

Resident Vitality in 34 Programs at 14 Academic Health Systems: Insights for Educating Physicians and Surgeons for the Future,Pololi L.H.; ; Evans A.T.; Civian J.T.; Shea S.; Brennan R.T.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify our understanding of how the culture of residency training influences the well-being of residents, this study reports on the vitality of residents at 34 programs across the United States and identifies characteristics of the programs, institutions and residents that are associated with high resident vitality. DESIGN: In 2014 to 2015, residents nationally were surveyed using the validated C - Change Resident Survey. The survey assessed residents' vitality and 12 other dimensions that characterize residents' perspectives of the culture of the residency training programs: Self-efficacy, Institutional/program support, Relationships/inclusion/trust, Values alignment, Ethical/moral distress, Respect, Leadership aspirations, Mentoring, Work-life integration, Gender equity, Racial/ethnic minority equity, and self-assessed Competencies. Multilevel models were used to assess vitality within and across programs, and examine predictors including resident, program, and institution characteristics.

"Women's leadership in neuropsychology: historical perspectives, present trends, and future directions",Sachs B.C.; ; Benitez A.; Buelow M.T.; Gooding A.; Schaefer L.A.; Sim A.H.; Tussey C.M.; Shear P.K.,"OBJECTIVE: Although psychology has become a female-dominated field, this pattern of gender representation has not held true within the specialty of neuropsychology. In recent years more women have been pursuing careers in neuropsychology, and while the balance of male and female neuropsychologists as a whole has shifted, it is unclear whether the gender composition of leadership has also changed. Our goal was to survey various neuropsychological organizations, training programs, editorial boards, and organizations granting board certification to determine the current gender composition of leadership positions within neuropsychology. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): A literature review was conducted to examine past trends of gender composition in neuropsychology, psychology, medicine, and academia.

A qualitative study on leadership experiences of women doctors in Korea,Kim S.H.; ; Kim B.-O.; Hong S.-W.; Shin H.-Y.,"This study was designed to explore women doctors' leadership experiences and to identify mechanisms of leadership development based on their experiences. Between November 1 and December 18, 2017 in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 women doctors whose professional roles included being the dean of a college of medicine director of a university hospital system director of a government institution, and member of the National Assembly. Twelve meaningful experiences were discovered, and 10 mechanisms and several action steps for developing women doctors' leadership were drawn from the interviews. Firstly women doctors' leadership experiences can be divided into 4 periods: experiences before entering medical school time during medical school, the training process, and experiences after completing board certification as a clinical specialist or PhD candidate. These periods were respectively designated as an unaffected leap, temporary break, involuntary interruption, and voluntary leap forward. Secondly, based on these results, 10 mechanisms for leadership development were identified. These included an intimate relationship with one's father, curiosity and concerns about various themes, accepting opportunities that arise, work-life balance from an individual perspective, promotion of social concerns regarding the under-representation of medical leaders, removal of traditional stereotypes about women doctors, remedies for invisible discrimination (glass ceiling) from a social perspective, as well as the provision of equal leadership experience and opportunities, the promotion of active mentoring, and the extension of formal and informal networks from an educational perspective.

How Prospective Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Trainees Rank Residency Training Programs,Auriemma M.J.; ; Whitehair C.L.,"Background: Since the inception of the National Resident Matching Program, multiple studies have investigated the factors applicants consider important to ranking prospective residency programs. However, only 2 previous studies focused on prospective physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) trainees, and the most recent of these studies was published in 1993. It is unknown whether these previous studies are reflective of current prospective PM&R residents. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To assess various factors that contribute to prospective PM&R residents' decision making in choosing a residency program and compare these findings with previous studies. <ovid:br/>Design(s): An anonymous, voluntary questionnaire. <ovid:br/>Setting(s): A single PM&R residency program. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): All applicants to a single PM&R residency program. <ovid:br/>Method(s): All applicants to our PM&R residency program were invited to participate in a 44-item, 5-point Likert-based questionnaire.

Main Outcome Measurements: Means and standard deviations were calculated for items included in the survey. <ovid:br/>Result(s): A response rate of 26% was obtained, with the responses of 98 applicants (20%) ultimately analyzed. The highest rated factors included ""perceived happiness of current residents,"" ""opportunities for hands-on procedure training,"" ""perceived camaraderie among current residents,"" ""perceived camaraderie among faculty and current residents,"" ""perceived quality of current residents,"" and ""perceived work/life balance among current residents."" Although male and female respondents demonstrated similar ranking preferences, an apparent difference was detected between how genders rated the importance of ""whether the program projects a favorable environment for women"" and ""whether the program projects a favorable environment for minorities.""

The median net personal annual income was $AUD245 000 (IQR 180 000-365 000) for males compared to $AUD122 500 (IQR 96 000-225000) for females (p=0.01). The median self-reported hours worked per week was 35.0 (IQR 28.0-46.0) for females and 41.8 (IQR 36.5-48.5) for males (p= 0.04). This highlights a discrepancy in income/hours worked, as the median hours worked per week for females was 84% of the median hours worked per week for men, yet median income for females was half of that of males. Possible reasons for this were analysed including duration and types of consultations and provider fees. We found that although males and females charged a similar fee per consultation ($AUD131.57 for males and $AUD139.53 for females), there was a trend towards slightly longer consultation times with females (median of 20 minutes (IQR 20-30) for females vs. 20 minutes (IQR 15-25) for males). Males also had a greater number of consultations in 2014, with 992 consultations/male ophthalmologist in the calendar year, compared with 620 per female ophthalmologist. Male ophthalmologists also performed a greater number of surgeries, with a mean of 188 cataract operations/year compared to 97 per female ophthalmologist/year. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Males make up the majority of the ophthalmology workforce in Australia. Female ophthalmologists work fewer hours and earn less compared to male ophthalmologists despite similar consultation fees and accounting for the number of hours worked. The difference in remuneration may be partially accounted for by the proportionally higher number of procedures performed by male ophthalmologists.",2018,/,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,59,9,,628581205,,,#200,Lo 2018,"",""
Promoting work-life balance among women in academic otolaryngology,Meyer T.K.; ; Bergmark R.W.; Litvack J.R.; Sardesai M.G.; Zatz M.; Acosta A.S.,"Objectives: Although current literature adequately documents gender inequality issues and barriers to the advancement of women in academic surgery, there is little information regarding practical strategies used by successful women in academia to achieve work-life balance despite the structural challenges. This article aims to provide examples of such strategies to support women in academic otolaryngology as well as their trainees, peers, and mentors, in addition to informing leaders in academic surgery programs about worklife balance priorities. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Thirteen successful women in academic otolaryngology were recruited using networking sampling to participate in a qualitative interview about work-life balance in an academic otolaryngology practice.

"Review of 10 years workshop ""Career in Family Medicine"": An online survey",Poggenburg S.; ; Schirgi J.; Afshar K.; Muller B.; Bouchi-Hafner J.; Siebenhofer A.,"Background: The self-initiated workshop ""career in family medicine"" has existed since 2006 and aims to help junior scientists with their career and life planning. <ovid:br/>Method(s): A questionnaire was used to ask former participants about their expectations of the workshop. With special regard to the importance of their scientific careers, the impact of the workshop on occupational and personal change was evaluated. Using a partially standardized questionnaire, a cross-sectional online survey of 64 persons that participated in the workshop between 2006 and 2017 was conducted. The questions were evaluated quantitatively, descriptively or utilizing content analysis. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 34 of 64 former participants took part in the survey (response rate: 53 %). 67 % of respondents said the workshop had led to a change in their private and/or professional lives. Former participants continued to work on their academic qualifications after participating in the workshop. At the time of the survey, 66 % of the participating men and 10 % of the participating women were habilitated. 5 former participants held a directorate function, of which 4 were male. 94 % of participants said the workshop had completely or partially fulfilled their expectations and the same number said they would recommend it to others. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The workshop ""Career in Family Medicine"" helps young scientists recognize and give concrete form to their professional and private objectives.

Looking into the labyrinth of gender inequality: women physicians in academic medicine,Han H.; ; Kim Y.; Kim S.; Cho Y.; Chae C.,"CONTEXT: Gender inequality remains prevalent worldwide in academic medicine. A closer look into women physicians' gendered experiences through the lens of culture is necessary to advance understanding of gender inequality in this context. Relatively few studies, however, have investigated how social and cultural practices implicitly yet significantly affect gender inequality throughout women physicians' careers. <ovid:br/>OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to investigate the lived experiences of South Korean women physicians working in academic medicine and to focus on social and cultural influences on the gendered process of their career journeys. The study will extend our understanding of gender inequality in academic medicine through an in-depth analysis of social and cultural practices that affect the phenomenon. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We conducted a qualitative study utilising a grounded theory approach. Twenty-one women physicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed through a process of constant comparison using grounded theory to extract themes. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): Junior women physicians were more vulnerable to gender discrimination and channelled to 'ghettos' through the seniority-based, patriarchal, collectivist and business hospital culture in South Korea. Under pressure to excel at work, they had no work-family balance and experienced identity crises as competent doctors and mothers. They felt themselves to be 'othered' in multiple cultural contexts, including school ties, rankism and a culture of after-work gatherings. Minimal levels of leadership aspiration created a vicious cycle of a lack of social networking and mentoring. Pursuing individual excellence, they attributed their struggles to personal choices and rarely sought organisational support. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): The dynamics of cultural and social practices constantly and implicitly recreate mechanisms to maintain gender inequality in academic medicine in South Korea. Planned culture changes at individual, organisational and national levels are imperative to discontinue the vicious cycle that exists in the labyrinth of women physicians' career development in academic medicine.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education.",2018,/,Medical education,52,10,1083EP  - 1095,625484619,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/medu.13682,30255527,#203,Han 2018,"",""
Advancing gender equality through the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science: An exploratory study of women's and men's perceptions,Ovseiko P.V.; ; Chapple A.; Edmunds L.D.; Ziebland S.,"Background: While in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, higher education and research institutions are widely engaged with the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science to advance gender equality, empirical research on this process and its impact is rare. This study combined two data sets (free- text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews. Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women's careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias. Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences. Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes. To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The Author(s).",2017,/,Health Research Policy and Systems,15,1,12,614493794,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12961-017-0177-9,28222735,#204,Ovseiko 2017,"",""
"Evaluating a Medical School's Climate for Women's Success: Outcomes for Faculty Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion",Villablanca A.C.; ; Li Y.; Beckett L.A.; Howell L.P.,"Objective: Women are under-represented in academia. Causative factors include challenges of career-family integration. We evaluated factors reflecting institutional culture (promotion, retention, hiring, and biasing language in promotion letters) as part of an intervention to help shift culture and raise awareness of flexibility policies at the University of California, Davis (UCD). <ovid:br/>Material(s) and Method(s): Data on faculty use of family-friendly policies were obtained at baseline, and surveys for policy awareness were conducted pre(2010)/post(2013) an NIH-funded study educational intervention. Data on hires, separations, and promotions were obtained pre(2007-2009, 2234 person-year data points)/post(2010-2012, 2384 person-year data points) intervention and compared by logistic regression and for gender differences. Department promotion letters (53) were also analyzed for biasing language. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Policy use was overall low, highest for female assistant professors, and for maternity leave. Awareness significantly increased for all policies postintervention. Promotions decreased, likely because of increases in advancement deferrals or tenure clock extensions. Pre/postintervention, female and male hires were near parity for assistant professors, but female hires were substantially lower than males for associate (54% less likely, p = 0.03) and full professors (70% less likely, p = 0.002). Once hired, women were no more likely to separate than men. Fewer associate/full professors separated than assistant professors (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively), regardless of gender. Language in promotion letters was not gender biased. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): We demonstrate a shift at UCD toward a culture of work-life flexibility, an environment in which letters of recommendation show very few biased descriptions, and in which assistant professor hiring is gender equitable. At the same time, a decrease in number of faculty members applying for promotion and an imbalance of men over women at senior hires independent of policy awareness may challenge the assumption that family-friendly policies, while promoting flexibility, also have a positive impact on professional advancement.<ovid:br/>&#xa9; Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",2017,/,Journal of Women's Health,26,5,530EP  - 539,616311884,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2016.6018,28170291,#205,Villablanca 2017,"",""
"Write More Articles, Get More Grants: The Impact of Department Climate on Faculty Research Productivity",Sheridan J.; ; Savoy J.N.; Kaatz A.; Lee Y.-G.; Filut A.; Carnes M.,"Background: Many studies find that female faculty in academic medicine, science, and engineering experience adverse workplace climates. This study longitudinally investigates whether department climate is associated with future research productivity and whether the associations are stronger for female than male faculty. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Two waves of a faculty climate survey, institutional grant records, and publication records were collected for 789 faculties in academic medicine, science, and engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2000 and 2010. Research productivity was measured as Number of Publications and Number of Grants awarded, and department climate was measured with scales for professional interactions, department decision-making practices, climate for underrepresented groups, and work/life balance. Ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression methods were used to assess gender differences in productivity, influences of department climate on productivity, and gender differences in effects of climate on productivity. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Female faculty published fewer articles and were awarded fewer grants in the baseline period, but their productivity did not differ from male faculty on these measures in subsequent years. Number of Publications was positively affected by professional interactions, but negatively affected by positive work/life balance. Number of Grants awarded was positively affected by climate for underrepresented groups. These main effects did not differ by gender; however, some three-way interactions illuminated how different aspects of department climate affected productivity differently for men and women in specific situations. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): In perhaps the first study to assess the longitudinal impact of department climate on faculty research productivity, positive department climate is associated with significantly greater productivity for all faculty - women and men. However, some positive aspects of climate (specifically, work/life balance) may be associated with lower productivity for some female faculty at specific career periods.

Assessing the Culture of Residency Using the C - Change Resident Survey: Validity Evidence in 34 U.S. Residency Programs,Pololi L.H.; ; Evans A.T.; Civian J.T.; Shea S.; Brennan R.T.,"Background: A practical instrument is needed to reliably measure the clinical learning environment and professionalism for residents. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): To develop and present evidence of validity of an instrument to assess the culture of residency programs and the clinical learning environment. <ovid:br/>Design(s): During 2014-2015, we surveyed residents using the C - Change Resident Survey to assess residents' perceptions of the culture in their programs. <ovid:br/>Participant(s): Residents in all years of training in 34 programs in internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery in 14 geographically diverse public and private academic health systems. Main Measures: The C - Change Resident Survey assessed residents' perceptions of 13 dimensions of the culture: Vitality, Self-Efficacy, Institutional Support, Relationships/Inclusion, Values Alignment, Ethical/Moral Distress, Respect, Mentoring, Work-Life Integration, Gender Equity, Racial/Ethnic Minority Equity, and self-assessed Competencies. We measured the internal reliability of each of the 13 dimensions and evaluated response process, content validity, and construct-related evidence validity by assessing relationships predicted by our conceptual model and prior research. We also assessed whether the measurements were sensitive to differences in specialty and across institutions. Key Results: A total of 1708 residents completed the survey [internal medicine: n = 956, pediatrics: n = 411, general surgery: n = 311 (51% women; 16% underrepresented in medicine minority)], with a response rate of 70% (range across programs, 51-87%). Internal consistency of each dimension was high (Cronbach alpha: 0.73-0.90). The instrument was able to detect significant differences in the learning environment across programs and sites. Evidence of validity was supported by a good response process and the demonstration of several relationships predicted by our conceptual model. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The C - Change Resident Survey assesses the clinical learning environment for residents, and we encourage further study of validity in different contexts.

The relationship between working conditions and self-rated health among medical doctors: evidence from seven waves of the Medicine In Australia Balancing Employment and Life (Mabel) survey,Milner A.; ; Witt K.; Spittal M.J.; Bismark M.; Graham M.; LaMontagne A.D.,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial job stressors, such as low control and high demands, have been found to influence the health and wellbeing of doctors. However, past research in this area has relied on cross-sectional data, which limits causal inferences about the influence of psychosocial job stressors on health. In this study, we examine this relationship longitudinally while also assessing whether the relationship between psychosocial job stressors and health is modified by gender., METHODS: The data source was seven annual waves of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) survey. The outcome was self-rated health (measured using the SF-12), and key exposures reflected job control, job demands, work-life balance variables, employment arrangements, and aggression experienced at work. We used longitudinal fixed and random effects regression models to assess within and between-person changes in health., RESULTS: Excessive job demands, low job control, feelings of not being rewarded at work, and work-life imbalance were associated with higher within-person odds of poorer self-rated health. Gender differences were apparent.

WOMEN AND MEN IN THE AUSTRALASIAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICAL SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN MEDICINE: WORKFORCE SURVEY,Bezak E.; ; Suchowerska R.; Mackonis E.C.; Pillen H.; Ralston A.; Haworth A.; Suchowerska N.,"Introduction: A survey was designed to determine the aspirations, motivations and workplace experiences of members of the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). The survey collected both quantitate and qualitative data, including open ended questions. This presentation reports the survey's qualitative results. The qualitative data analysis was in part funded by the ACPSEM. <ovid:br/>Method(s): The research was approved by Ethics at University of South Australia and endorsed by ACPSEM. All 205 female members (30% of total membership) and 440 males were invited to complete the survey online. The data for the qualitative analysis were responses to openended questions within the Survey. The data was thematically analysed by twice. First, by the survey authors and secondly by a single researcher, who was a male allied health researcher not involved in the development of the survey or data collection. Open codes were assigned to key categories in the data on a first reading of the survey responses and refined to 24 codes on a second reading. Codes were arranged into themes inductively by examining the relationship between them. Analysis of responses continued until no new themes emerged from the data, despite further analysis. Since the number of females in a senior managerial role was limited, further analysis was performed for this subgroup to account for any relevant variations in the data. <ovid:br/>Result(s): 102 female and 150 male completed surveys were received, with 66 surveys analysed, before data saturation was reached. The survey revealed a number of themes that reflect concerns and opportunities identifying the direction for improving work-life balance and gender equity within the medical physics profession in Australasia. Issues around managing challenging workloads and professional development were amplified for women with children and child-rearing responsibilities, directly contributing to a reduction in work capacity and a reorientation of work-life priorities. Some evidence of gender inequities in the professional context were reported. Female respondents, in particular those assuming a carers role, perceived these inequities to be the entrenched attitudes and structures that act to favour one group over another. For some women, this gender bias meant that it was difficult to engage fully in the profession when indicators of success (e.g. meeting the inflexible needs of organisations through working long hours, work hour flexibility and travel) favoured those without carer responsibilities. Inefficient management practices contributed to an environment where unreasonable time demands are placed on staff with carer responsibilities, limiting opportunities to engage in career development activities. In contrast, male (and some female) respondents perceived the workplace to offer equal treatment of individuals irrespective of gender and that individuals are responsible for their own success and advancement within the profession. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): The survey provides direction for strategies to improve work-life balance and enable equitable engagement in the profession. The first is to identify and develop role models that actively model successful work-life balance and flexibility in gender roles and in professional conduct. The second is to improve the management skills of current and emerging administrators, advocating for improved work conditions for medical physics professionals at an organisation level. Finally, efforts need to be made to establish flexible professional development and career progression opportunities amongst those that are unable to commit to large workloads, which is common for those with child-rearing responsibilities. The realisation of these strategic goals will reduce the identified barriers to full female participation in the workforce, and shift gender-based subcultures within the workplace.",2017,/,Journal of Medical Physics,42,Supplement 1,S43,643838406,,,#210,Bezak 2017,"",""
Feminem: An open access platform to bring women in emergency medicine together,Kass D.; ; Goldberg E.M.; Ranney M.L.; Choo E.K.; Beck-Esmay J.,"Background: Disparities in engagement, retention, and promotion of women in emergency medicine (EM) are well described. These disparities are partly due to lack of resources, mentorship, and a community of support for physicians of both genders. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): FemInEM was created to provide resources and guidance for engaging women in EM in all stages of life and career. Its mission is to address gender disparities proactively through peer support and positive promotion.

How Many Graduating Family Medicine Residents Have Chosen Financial Support for Service Commitments?,Phillips J.; ; Peterson L.E.; Fang B.; Kovar-Gough I.; Phillips R.L.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: New family physicians have opportunities to avoid accruing educational debt or have loans repaid by making a commitment to public service. Little information is available about the numbers of early career family physicians who have made service commitments to fund their education. The purpose of this study is to describe the proportion of graduating family medicine residents who have enrolled in US military and National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship and loan repayment programs, thus obligating them to future public service., METHODS: The study was a secondary analysis of de-identified data from the 2014 and 2015 American Board of Family Medicine examination registration questionnaire, which is required of all residents applying for board certification. Descriptive statistics were used to indicate the numbers and proportions of respondents who indicated military or NHSC financial support. Chi square analyses were used to analyze differences between groups., RESULTS: Of the 6,231 residents studied, 271 (4.4%) had either obtained military support (n=191, 3.1%) or enrolled in the NHSC (n=80, 1.3%). More men had enrolled in the military than women (4.2% vs 2.2%, P<0.01), but there was no significant NHSC gender difference. Underrepresented minorities (URM) were twice as likely to have enrolled in NHSC as non-URM residents (2.5% vs 1.0%, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Only a small fraction of graduating family medicine residents have used either military enrollment or NHSC scholarships to fund their education.

What do career motivated young women understand about elective oocyte cryopreservation and where do they receive their information?,Stevenson E.L.; ; Chang J.; Hurt M.,"OBJECTIVE: Due to the relative novelty of oocyte cryopreservation for fertility preservation, it is unclear how much women understand about the process and the accuracy of their knowledge. Moreover, a gap exists in determining how women receive information about family planning, biological timing and reproductive interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine what young, professionally focused women understand about oocyte cryopreservation, and which resources they use to access reproductive information. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional. MATERIALSAND METHODS: Female graduate students from a top-tier university were recruited via email with a survey link. Eligibility included: 22-35, no children, and not trying to conceive a pregnancy/adopt. Participants completed an electronic survey with questions about demographics, fertility knowledge (Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale), oocyte cryopreservation knowledge, and sources of fertility and oocyte cryopreservation information. Descriptive statistics were calculated on all variables. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): 284 highly educated, primarily single and white participants completed the survey. The mean age was 26.2 (SD 3.10). The sample demonstrated average knowledge about fertility (64% out of 100%, SD 0.18); the most used source for information about fertility was formal education (87.1%), information to help make fertility decisions came from gynecologists (85.3%), and information about oocyte cryopreservation came from media (63.4%) versus gynecologists (32%). Only 26.6% felt well informed about their fertility. 93.9% had heard of oocyte cryopreservation yet only 7.2% have considered its use. While most (74.9%) rank fertility as important, 83% would not consider postponing family until career (83.0%) and relationship (85.2%) are established. Half (52.2%) feel there is a social stigma surrounding oocyte cryopreservation and 70.1% feel the media gives the impression that motherhood is a viable option after 40 years of age. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): This study found that professionally motivated women receive most information about fertility from formal sources (education, healthcare providers) but information about oocyte cryopreservation from media sources. They lack solid, evidence-based knowledge about fertility that may impact future family building, therefore more effort is needed to address these gaps in knowledge to help professionally motivated women make informed decisions about future family planning.",2017,/,Fertility and Sterility,108,3 Supplement 1,e100,618466586,,,#213,Stevenson 2017,"",""

A quarter (25.2%; 63 out of 250) of the respondents felt burnt-out at that stage of their careers. 68.35% (203/297) of the respondents felt that being a woman ophthalmologist in India was more challenging than being a male ophthalmologist. This perception was significantly more amongst women respondents (p < 0.0002). Greater family responsibility, long working hours, and having to work harder were the challenges faced by female ophthalmologists. There was a significant difference in perception between male and female ophthalmologists regarding the presence of disparity in earnings given equal qualifications and experience with more women responding in the affirmative., CONCLUSIONS: Indian ophthalmologists have personally and professionally satisfying careers with low rates of burnout. While good family support and an understanding partner help ophthalmologists achieve good work-life balance, women ophthalmologists perceive a gender-based disparity when it comes to proving their worth and getting suitably remunerated.",2017,/,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",56,2,221EP  - 228,618414920,https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/WOR-172488,28211838,#214,Nair 2017,"",""
"MP EDUCATION, PROFFESSION AND AS ACAREER FOR WOMEN IN BANGLADESH: PROBLEMS AND PERSPECTIVE",Afrin K.T.; ; Karmaker N.; Anupama H.A.,"Introduction: Medical physics is among the fastest progressing scientific and practical areas in Bangladesh. Historically women had played an important role in the field of physics, contributing to the leading achievements in the area. Our world is dominated by men but women have made significant contributions to the development of medical physics study and practice. According to survey of IOMP 2015, Sixty-six countries answered the survey, with 52% of responses provided by women. The total number of medical physicists cited was 17024, representing more than three quarters of the worldwide medical physics workforce. This included 4807 women - just 28% of the total. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): The main objective of this study is to find out the educational, career and professionals status of medical physics for women in Bangladesh existing or opportunity. In Bangladesh three universitiesare offering M.Sc program in medical physics (MP); Gono Bishwabidyalay (University) is the pioneer one, offering degree since 2001, Dhaka University and Khwaja Yunus Ali University, offering since 2014. Female students areonly 20% in these universities, due to challenge of balancing family life, childcare support, gender inequality, social class, caste, religion, ethnicity, early marriage and house hold work. Also for economical constraint, normally after bachelor course, the femalestudents are unable to admit in M.Sc course as educations in private University areexpensive for poor students. Another reason is traditionally women are underrepresented in those fields based on mathematics and physical science. Medical physics study is a new subject with a little exposure to common people so our people are unawareabout itsprospective career. Lack of job availability, dreadful of radiation hazards for the females discontinues their careers. Also in Bangladesh jobs are available after four years honors' program. In this field for career in medical physics minimum requirement is M.Sc in MP, which is one of cause for discontinuing to develop career in this field. Most of the female students in science are always pressurized from their family for early marriage. It seems tobe difficult to succeed as a medical physicist. As a profession medical physics in Bangladesh is now at the beginning stage because of the lack of governmental position in hospital. Bangladesh Medical Physics Society (BMPS) is working with the government for recruitment rules for the MP. On the other hand private hospitals are recruiting MP with the advent of diagnostic and therapeutic treatment modalities based on medical physics. Discussion and <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): According to WHO report, we need total 160 radiotherapycenters, 320 LINACS, 640 Medical Physicists only in cancer treatment. Bangladesh government is purchasing recent updated technology for radiotherapy and radiology. The importance and necessity of this manpower is needed to be circulated in media and newspapers for public awareness. In the mean time, BMPS is working hard to popularize this subject, make awareness in public sector and to create position in the hospitals and continuous professional development for the graduates. The experiment to establish a department in Gono University is a successful story. Through German collaboration since its inception and help of other countries like India and China, Gono University is trying hard to maintain international standard. IOMP is working towards strengthening of the role of the women in our professional society. Two years training program for certificationwill be started through national and international collaboration. BMPSalso trying best to involvefemale participants specially in AAPM, IAEA, AFOMP, IOMP conference for their career. A step towards achieving this objective is the formation of IOMP-W (IOMP women medical physics group). We certainly believe this group will encourage our Female medical physics community in education, profession and career.",2017,/,Journal of Medical Physics,42,Supplement 1,S41EP  - S42,643838378,,,#215,Afrin 2017,"",""
Burnout in Female Faculty Members,Cassidy-Vu L.; ; Beck K.; Moore J.B.,"Despite approximately equal numbers of male and female medical school graduates, women are entering academic medicine at a lower rate than their male colleagues. Of those who do assume a faculty position, female faculty members report higher levels of burnout, often attributable to gender-specific difficulties in clinical expectations and maintenance of work-life balance. Many of these struggles are attributable to issues that are amenable to supportive policies, but these policies are inconsistent in their availability and practice. This commentary presents evidence for inconsistencies in the day-to-day experience of female faculty members, and proposes solutions for the mitigation of the challenges experienced more often by female faculty members with the goal of diversifying and strengthening academic medicine.",2017,/,Journal of primary care & community health,8,2,97EP  - 99,619641859,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150131916669191,27650035,#216,Cassidy-Vu 2017,"",""

Trainees comprised UK graduates and International Medical Graduates, across all stages of training in 6 specialties (General Practice, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Radiology, Surgery) and Foundation. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Postgraduate training was characterised by work-life imbalance. Long hours at work were typically supplemented with revision and completion of the e-portfolio. Trainees regularly moved workplaces which could disrupt their personal lives and sometimes led to separation from friends and family. This made it challenging to cope with personal pressures, the stresses of which could then impinge on learning and training, while also leaving trainees with a lack of social support outside work to buffer against the considerable stresses of training. Low morale and harm to well-being resulted in some trainees feeling dehumanised. Work-life imbalance was particularly severe for those with children and especially women who faced a lack of less-than-full-time positions and discriminatory attitudes. Female trainees frequently talked about having to choose a specialty they felt was more conducive to a work-life balance such as General Practice. The proposed junior doctor contract was felt to exacerbate existing problems. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): A lack of work-life balance in postgraduate medical training negatively impacted on trainees' learning and well-being.

Study on work life balance of teachers in engineering colleges in Kerala,Dhanya J.S.; ; Kinslin D.,"Work life balance is not a new concept. The satisfaction in a job or work would be depending on many factors like remuneration, work conditions, growth prospects, support for employees and several other factors. One of the most important such factors as found from the result of much research conducted in this domain is, Work Life Balance (WLB). This factor can be described as a measure of the balance that exists between the job and the personal life of an employee. Work life balance for teachers has become one of the greatest challenges in today's world. Teachers need to spend extra hours' everyday to be effective and productive in their profession so that they could reach higher levels and face the challenging atmosphere. Work life balance helps the faculty to be more productive in their work along with their personal commitments and family interest. It is necessary that the institution needs to eliminate impractical discrimination and provide equal opportunities for both men and women. Good work life balance reduces stress and leads to productive outcomes. Thus the teaching faculty is able to give their best with high motivation and morale. Reviews also indicate that the perception of work life balance is observed to be different across genders. Work based support to teachers is positively associated to job satisfaction, organizational commitment and career accomplishment. These reviews highlight that there are work life balance issues that need to be addressed. Prior research points out that a women teacher struggles hard to strike the balance between being a caring homemaker and a responsible teacher. Hence there is a pertinent need to analyze, compare and contrast and study the issues and factors associated with work life balance of women faculty in educational institutions; compare and contrast the work life balance across educational institutions in the category of Government, Aided and self financing mode. It is important to bring to light any inadequacy of the initiatives taken by the authorities and colleges to achieve a healthy work life balance for women teachers in the chosen Engineering discipline. This study has been carried out among the faculty of engineering colleges in Kerala, covering three districts namely: Trivandrum, Cochin and Calicut. The study includes sample of 318 engineering faculty belonging to the Junior Level, Middle Level and Senior Level. The survey included more women respondents about 75%. The study assesses the current status of perceived work life balance among engineering college teachers in Kerala particularly with respect to a) work-family spill over b) work-family conflict and c) Work-family facilitation. Secondly the work environment with respect to supportive HR policies, supervisor support, organizational and management support, teamwork, trust, openness in communication as exists in engineering institutions were also studied. And an attempt has also been made to assess the relationship between work environment in the selected engineering colleges and WLB among teachers. The study looks into the awareness of employees about the Work Life Balance policies of the institution, to determine its effectiveness in implementation, to determine if there is proper balance between Work and personal lives of employees and to suggest strategies for improvement. Out of the 318 engineering college teachers, 136 were from private colleges, 125 were from government colleges and 57 from aided colleges. The average age of the members of the final sample was 35 years and had a total work experience for an average of 11 years. Tools like Mean, t-Test, ANOVA, correlation analysis, regression analysis were used to make relevant analysis between work life balance and its impact on Gender equity and women empowerment. The study revealed that level of work life balance varies in Government, private and aided Engineering colleges. Mean values and ANOVA reveals that Work family spill over, work family conflict and work family facilitation -All the three aspects were perceived as Moderate by the teachers working in engineering colleges across the Government, Aided and Self financing colleges. However as indicated by the t test results the same was found at the same level without any significant variation between the male and female faculty across the three types of colleges. So far as the perception of Junior Level, Middle Level and senior faculty are concerned ANOVA revealed that all the three aspects were perceived as at their moderate level without much variation. It was found that organizational climate in the selected colleges about supportive HR policies, supervisor support, teamwork, management support, team work and trust was moderately favourable in government, aided and private engineering colleges. It has been proven that organizations supportive of employees can reduce work family conflict. The best practices for WLB includes Flexi time, Work commuting, Five days work per week, Planned vacations, leave facilities including maternity leave, employee welfare schemes and talent development initiatives. Some innovative ideas need to evolved by the policy makers and management of Engineering colleges in this context for reducing work life spill over and conflict. It was found that teachers experienced moderate level of WLB leaving substantial scope for the management to improve the WLB of the teachers.",2016,/,Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences,9,4,2098EP  - 2104,613090661,,,#218,Dhanya 2016,"",""
Why do women choose or reject careers in academic medicine? A narrative review of empirical evidence,Edmunds L.D.; ; Ovseiko P.V.; Shepperd S.; Greenhalgh T.; Frith P.; Roberts N.W.; Pololi L.H.; Buchan A.M.,"Women are under-represented in academic medicine. We reviewed the empirical evidence focusing on the reasons for women's choice or rejection of careers in academic medicine. Using a systematic search, we identified 52 studies published between 1985, and 2015. More than half had methodological limitations and most were from North America. Eight main themes were explored in these studies. There was consistent evidence for four of these themes: women are interested in teaching more than in research; participation in research can encourage women into academic medicine; women lack adequate mentors and role models; and women experience gender discrimination and bias. The evidence was conflicting on four themes: women are less interested in research than men; women lose commitment to research as their education and training progress; women are deterred from academic careers by financial considerations; and women are deterred by concerns about work-life balance. Inconsistency of findings across studies suggests significant opportunities to overcome barriers by providing a more enabling environment. We identified substantial gaps in the scientific literature that could form the focus of future research, including shifting the focus from individuals' career choices to the societal and organisational contexts and cultures within which those choices are made; extending the evidence base to include a wider range of countries and settings; and testing the efficacy of interventions.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,/,The Lancet,388,10062,2948EP  - 2958,610047462,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2815%2901091-0,27105721,#219,Edmunds 2016,"",""
Female physicians and the future of endocrinology,Pelley E.; ; Danoff A.; Cooper D.S.; Becker C.,"Context: Given that approximately 70% of current endocrinology fellows are women, female physicians will compose the majority of the future endocrinology workforce. This gender shift partly reflects an apparent waning of interest in endocrinology among male trainees. It also coincides with a projected shortage of endocrinologists overall. Female physicians face unique challenges in the workplace. To continue to attract trainees to the specialty and support their success, it is imperative that these challenges be recognized, understood, and addressed. <ovid:br/>Evidence Acquisition: A PubMed search using the terms ""female physician"" and ""physician gender"" covering the years 2000a""2015 was performed. Additional references were identified through review of the citations of the retrieved articles. The following topics were identified as key to understanding the impact of this gender shift: professional satisfaction, work-life balance, income, parenthood, academic success, and patient satisfaction. <ovid:br/>Evidence Synthesis: Several changes can be predicted to occur as endocrinology becomes a femalepredominant specialty. Although professional satisfaction should remain stable, increased burnout rates are likely. Work-life balance challenges will likely be magnified. The combined effects of occupational gender segregation and a gender pay gap are predicted to negatively impact salaries of endocrinologists of both genders. The underrepresentation of women in academic leadership may mean a lesser voice for endocrinology in this arena. Finally, gender biases evident in patient satisfaction measuresa""commonly used as proxies for quality of carea""may disproportionately impact endocrinology. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Endocrinology is predicted to become the most female-predominant subspecialty of internal medicine. The specialty of endocrinology should take a lead role in advocating for changes that support the success of female physicians. Strengthening and supporting the physician workforce can only serve to attract talented physicians of both genders to the specialty, which will be key to meeting the needs of the increasing numbers of patients with endocrine disorders.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 by the Endocrine Society.",2016,/,Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,101,1,16EP  - 22,607811340,https://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2015-3436,26574957,#220,Pelley 2016,"",""
Women in Leadership: Why So Few and What to Do About It,Surawicz C.M.; ,"The numbers of women in medical school and in medical training have increased dramatically and are near 50% overall, but the number of women who advance to senior and leadership positions is not nearly this high. There are many reasons why the number of women in leadership roles in academic medicine has not kept pace with the number of women entering the field of medicine. Two popular themes are the glass ceiling (referring to an invisible barrier to advancement) and the leaky pipeline (the loss of women faculty along the path, or pipeline, to advancement). I believe that both come into play. Glass ceiling issues tend to be of two types: those related to the institutional culture and those related to problems of bias, especially unconscious bias. Leaky pipeline issues include the challenges of work-life integration and the need for leadership development for women. There are solutions to all of these challenges. These include improving institutional culture; making sure women advance as quickly as men and are paid equitably; ensuring that there are resources to help with work-life balance, related not only to family but to all aspects of life; and providing adequate mentoring and leadership training. These measures will help all faculty, as factors that hamper women's advancement may hamper men as well. Although these themes are broadly applicable, there are strategies that can address them all. We just need to be aware, and be proactive, and we will succeed in breaking the glass ceiling and patching the leaky pipeline.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2016 American College of Radiology",2016,/,Journal of the American College of Radiology,13,12,1433EP  - 1437,613713377,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2016.08.026,,#221,Surawicz 2016,"",""
An Integrated Framework for Gender Equity in Academic Medicine,Westring A.; ; McDonald J.M.; Carr P.; Grisso J.A.,"In 2008, the National Institutes of Health funded 14 R01 grants to study causal factors that promote and support women's biomedical careers. The Research Partnership on Women in Biomedical Careers, a multi-institutional collaboration of the investigators, is one product of this initiative.A comprehensive framework is needed to address change at many levels-department, institution, academic community, and beyond-and enable gender equity in the development of successful biomedical careers. The authors suggest four distinct but interrelated aspects of culture conducive to gender equity: equal access to resources and opportunities, minimizing unconscious gender bias, enhancing work-life balance, and leadership engagement. They review the collection of eight articles in this issue, which each address one or more of the four dimensions of culture. The articles suggest that improving mentor-mentee fit, coaching grant reviewers on unconscious bias, and providing equal compensation and adequate resources for career development will contribute positively to gender equity in academic medicine.Academic medicine must adopt an integrated perspective on culture for women and acknowledge the multiple facets essential to gender equity. To effect change, culture must be addressed both within and beyond academic health centers (AHCs). Leaders within AHCs must examine their institutions' processes, resources, and assessment for fairness and transparency; mobilize personnel and financial resources to implement evidence-based initiatives; and assign accountability for providing transparent progress assessments. Beyond AHCs, organizations must examine their operations and implement change to ensure parity of funding, research, and leadership opportunities as well as transparency of assessment and accreditation.",2016,/,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,91,8,1041EP  - 1044,617331940,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000001275,27276008,#222,Westring 2016,"",""
The gendered realities and talent management imperatives of women physicians,Hoff T.; ; Scott S.,"INTRODUCTION: U.S. medicine is increasingly a gender-balanced profession with half of all medical school graduates now female. Despite this reality and the potentially transformative nature of a large female physician cohort in U.S. health care, there is less examination of their workplace realities and the key talent management strategies for health care organizations employing women physicians., PURPOSE: First, we identify current knowledge about U.S. women physician satisfaction, role challenges, and work tradeoffs. Gender theory is used to help interpret these workplace realities. Second, we use this information to identify talent management strategies health care organizations might consider to mitigate the realities and provide greater support for women physicians., METHODS: To facilitate our analysis, we conducted a narrative review of published research that includes analysis focused on U.S. women physicians for the time period 2006-2014. Applying ideas from gender theory, we extrapolated key findings from that research related to three issues: satisfaction, role challenges, and tradeoffs. Then we synthesized the findings to identify general talent management strategies that could address these dynamics proactively while enhancing recruitment and retention with respect to women physicians., FINDINGS: U.S. women physicians express strong levels of satisfaction, particularly with their careers, at the same time they continue to experience gender-based inequities, role challenges, and lack of work-life balance in their chosen specialty fields. Lack of suitable role models and appropriate mentoring for women physicians, in addition to barriers to career advancement, are also prevalent across different medical specialties., CONCLUSION: Similar to other occupations and industries, gender-based inequities and role strains are very real issues for women physicians. Health care organizations must acknowledge these issues and employ effective talent management strategies aimed at women doctors if they are to be viewed as an employer of choice by this increasingly important occupational cohort.",2016,/,Health care management review,41,3,189EP  - 199,620350128,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000069,25978004,#225,Hoff 2016,"",""

Women leaders in academic medicine: A chair's perspective,Jaglan S.; ,"Background: Since 1975, the medical field has seen a sixfold increase in female physicians. According to the AAMC in 2011-2012, women represented 37% of full-time medical school faculty, 43% of assistant professors, 20% of full professors, 14% of department chairs, and 12% of medical school deans. Despite this great increase, there is a ""trickling off"" effect of women in high-level leadership positions, especially as full professors, department chairs, and medical school deans. <ovid:br/>Objective(s): Assess the leadership culture in a prominent academic medical center and to gain a greater understanding of the perspectives that department chairs have on women in academic leadership positions. <ovid:br/>Method(s): Our study was conducted between May 2013-August 2013. We interviewed 18 of 25 clinical department chairs within our institution, a 72% response rate. Each interview was 20-40 minutes with standardized questions, including open-ended questions on their views on leadership characteristics, the barriers women face, why they face them, and possible solutions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and remained confidential. The department chairs were only excluded if they were unable to schedule an interview during that time. <ovid:br/>Result(s): The most cited barriers to women in leadership positions were Experience, Work-Life Balance, Self-Perception, and Specialty. Of our chairs, 89% discussed Work-Life Balance as the major barrier to women attaining leadership positions. In accordance, 39% felt that child-bearing years, or ""time lag"", is discriminatory against women. 28% felt that women tend to lack self-promotion/negotiation skills (Self-perception), which supports the need to empower young women and to develop an interest in leadership. Additionally, 60% of women specialize in internal medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, obstetricsgynecology, psychiatry, and anesthesiology, leading to lack of mentorship in other specialties. This lack of mentorship was voiced most strongly by the female department chairs. Of the interviews conducted, 100% believed that men and women are equally capable of being effective leaders in medicine and 41% reported that gender entered their thought process when hiring faculty or residents. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Our study emphasizes the need for institutionally-based programs to promote women leaders in medicine, to support those already in leadership positions and to foster the development of future female leaders. By instating a program dedicated to women in medicine, institutions are promoting gender diversity, which has been positively linked to financial performance. These programs should focus on reentry for those who take leave, mentorship, and addressing specific barriers women may face. These are key components to promote the success and progression of women in medical leadership positions and to improve institutional level leadership as a whole.

Gender and physician specialization and practice settings in Ecuador: a qualitative study,Bedoya-Vaca R.; ; Derose K.P.; Romero-Sandoval N.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing proportion of women in the medical profession is a worldwide phenomenon often called the ""feminization of medicine."" However, it is understudied in low and middle-income countries, particularly in Latin America., METHODS: Using a qualitative, descriptive design, we explored the influence of gender and other factors on physician career decision-making and experiences, including medical specialty and public vs. private practice, in Quito, Ecuador, through in-depth, semi-structured interviews (n = 31) in 2014. Theoretical sampling was used to obtain approximately equal numbers of women and men and a range of medical specialties and practice settings; data saturation was used to determine sample size. Transcripts were analyzed using content coding procedures to mark quotations related to major topics and sub-themes included in the interview guide and inductive (grounded theory) approaches to identify new themes and sub-themes., RESULTS: Gendered norms regarding women's primary role in childrearing, along with social class or economic resources, strongly influenced physicians' choice of medical specialty and practice settings. Women physicians, especially surgeons, have had to ""pay the price"" socially, often remaining single and/or childless, or ending up divorced; in addition, both women and men face limited opportunities for medical residency training in Ecuador, thus specialty is determined by economic resources and ""opportunity."" Women physicians often experience discrimination from patients, nurses, and, sometimes, other physicians, which has limited their mobility and ability to operate independently and in the private sector. The public sector, where patients cannot ""choose"" their doctors, offers women more opportunities for professional success and advancement, and the regular hours enable organizing work and family responsibilities. However, the public sector has generally much less flexibility than the private sector, making it more difficult to balance work and family responsibilities., CONCLUSION: Women may outnumber men in medicine in Ecuador and across many parts of the world, but a number of structural issues-economic, social, and cultural-must be addressed for women to establish themselves in a wide variety of medical specialties and practice settings and for countries to realize the benefit of the investments being made to train and employ them.",2016,/,BMC health services research,16,1,662,618374392,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1917-1,27855673,#228,Bedoya-Vaca 2016,"",""

Gender gap in medicine: Only one woman councilor in the Japan surgical society,Tomizawa Y.; ,"Japan ranks low in the global gender gap index. Academic promotion is difficult for women doctors, and the leaky pipeline of women doctors is evident in academic medicine. The Japan Surgical Society (JSS) has 2,874 (7.2% of total membership) female members as of April 2014. The total number of councilors in JSS has increased, but there is still only one female member on the Council. The fact that there are so few women in decision-making positions makes it challenging to fight for equality. The Japanese Association of Medical Science (JAMS) is an association with exclusive institutional membership comprising the major medical societies in Japan, and currently has a membership of 122 specialist medical societies. It is essential to have at least one female committee member in each committee of the JAMS, which would provide opportunities to establish career paths for women doctors, to make rules that suit the lifestyle of women doctors, and to improve work-life balance.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Tohoku University Medical Press.",2015,/,Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine,235,2,97EP  - 102,611994081,https://dx.doi.org/10.1620/tjem.235.97,25749180,#231,Tomizawa 2015,"",""
Women family physicians: A career in academic family medicine - An example from Turkey,Unluoclu I.; ; Saatci E.; Akpinar E.,"When the first universities opened in Europe in the 12<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> century, they were, with few exceptions, open for men only. It was not until the 19<ovid:sup>th</ovid:sup> century that most European countries opened their academic institutions to female students and female teachers. At present, women occupy approximately one third of the academic posts in Turkey. Medical field is the third preferred area for women in Turkey. It is supposed that 30% of all physicians and almost half of 100,000 academic personnel in Turkey are female. However, the percentage of women decreases as the rank increases. Of residents, 47% are women whereas 35% of assistant professors, 31.6% of associate professors and 27.4% of full professors is women. The first academic tenure in family medicine was in 1994. By 15 March 2012, there are 82 associate professors and 16 full professors in family medicine. Of 82 associate professors, 46% (38) and of 16 full professors, 25% (4) are women. Changing the environment of academic medicine could enhance career satisfaction and success for both women and men. Medical schools should carefully examine their environment for gender equity in promotion and compensation. Educators have an obligation to medical students and residents to develop their knowledge and skills, including those related to career development, for effectively practicing medicine. Best possible care in family medicine requires gender competent professionals who understand the cultural, social and political determinants of health and can respond effectivelyto them.<ovid:br/>Copyright &#xa9; Wydawnictwo Continuo.",2015,/,Family Medicine and Primary Care Review,17,1,48EP  - 53,604110754,,,#233,Unluoclu 2015,"",""
Inadequate Progress for Women in Academic Medicine: Findings from the National Faculty Study,Carr P.L.; ; Gunn C.M.; Kaplan S.A.; Raj A.; Freund K.M.,"Background: Women have entered academic medicine in significant numbers for 4 decades and now comprise 20% of full-time faculty. Despite this, women have not reached senior positions in parity with men. We sought to explore the gender climate in academic medicine as perceived by representatives to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Group on Women in Medicine and Science (GWIMS) and Group on Diversity and Inclusion (GDI). <ovid:br/>Method(s): We conducted a qualitative analysis of semistructured telephone interviews with GWIMS and GDI representatives and other senior leaders at 24 randomly selected medical schools of the 1995 National Faculty Study. All were in the continental United States, balanced for public/private status and AAMC geographic region. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and organized into content areas before an inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Themes that were expressed by multiple informants were studied for patterns of association. <ovid:br/>Result(s): Five themes were identified: (1) a perceived wide spectrum in gender climate; (2) lack of parity in rank and leadership by gender; (3) lack of retention of women in academic medicine (the ""leaky pipeline""); (4) lack of gender equity in compensation; and (5) a disproportionate burden of family responsibilities and work-life balance on women's career progression. <ovid:br/>Conclusion(s): Key informants described improvements in the climate of academic medicine for women as modest.

Gender and generational influences on the pediatric workforce and practice,Spector N.D.; ; Cull W.; Daniels S.R.; Gilhooly J.; Hall J.; Horn I.; Marshall S.G.; Schumacher D.J.; Sectish T.C.; Stanton B.F.,"In response to demographic and other trends that may affect the future of the field of pediatrics, the Federation of Pediatric Organizations formed 4 working groups to participate in a year 's worth of research and discussion preliminary to a Visioning Summit focusing on pediatric practice, research, and training over the next 2 decades. This article, prepared by members of the Gender and Generations Working Group, summarizes findings relevant to the 2 broad categories of demographic trends represented in the name of the group and explores the interface of these trends with advances in technology and social media and the impact this is likely to have on the field of pediatrics. Available data suggest that the trends in the proportions of men and women entering pediatrics are similar to those over the past few decades and that changes in the overall ratio of men and women will not substantially affect pediatric practice. However, although women may be as likely to succeed in academic medicine and research, fewer women than men enter research, thereby potentially decreasing the number of pediatric researchers as the proportion of women increases. Complex generational differences affect both the workforce and interactions in the workplace. Differences between the 4 generational groups comprising the pediatric workforce are likely to result in an evolution of the role of the pediatrician, particularly as it relates to aspects of work-life balance and the use of technology and social media.

"Woman clinical scholars: ""sometimes you need to climb out a window, and scale the fire ladder, to get to the place you want to be""",Kalet A.; ; Rockfeld J.; Bickell N.; Fletcher K.E.; Schwartz K.,"BACKGROUND: To effectively build the next generation of academic physicians, we will need to understand factors that enable fellowship-prepared women to thrive in academia. To describe and explore the complexity and challenges of creating work/ life satisfaction in academic medicine we studied woman graduates of the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program (CSP, Class of 1976-2011). <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): We surveyed every woman graduate of the CSP graduate up through 2011 (n=360) by both email and post. The survey instrument (12 prompts requiring open text responses) was designed to explore current work situation, personal definitions of success and accomplishments, job negotiations, career regrets or disappointments, predominant feelings about work life, and advice for others. All data was de-identified and 4 independent readers coded overlapping subsets of the data. A coding scheme fit to the data was refined through discussion and applied to the data by two analysts using DedooseTM qualitative analysis software. <ovid:br/>RESULT(S): After 5 reminders 104/360 (29 %) of the cohort responded, mean age 45 (range 32 to 65), 6 % single, 85 % partnered, and 8 % divorced/separated, 87 % have children (average number of children 2.15, range 1 to 5). Preliminary analysis revealed the following major theme categories: Work, Balance, Mentoring, Home/ Family, Managing Change, Flexibility, Negotiation, Collaboration, Definitions of Success, and Advice. Respondents endorsing being very satisfied were more likely to describe work as personally and locally meaningful, having the needed scheduling flexibility to care for family, egalitarian spousal support, mentoring and other supportive relationships at work and home and were conducting collaborative research on teams. Less common themes include: issues of self care or neglect, painful regrets, leaving academia, being childless by choice. Work hours, financial constraints and availability of mentoring were among the issues, which differed by clinical discipline. Strategies to manage work-life balance were specific to stage of career and age of children. Younger women emphasized both setting boundaries while home and working from home. Senior women described ""atypical"" paths through and away from academia with career transitions resulting from discordance among work, need for schedule flexibility and institutional values including gender based discrimination, spousal career changes, and/or need for better career-fit. The majority of these women were highly satisfied and passionate about their work, even those early career women uncertain the effort will be worthwhile. Remaining flexible and open to opportunities, mentoring, building teams to do multi-disciplinary collaborative research work, valuing supportive relationships and seeking ongoing meaningful work in later life were significant themes for experienced academic women. Detailed advice about how to survive tough times was shared. <ovid:br/>CONCLUSION(S): These CSP graduates are largely satisfied with and passionate about their work and family life and feel, proud and grateful to have pursued meaningful work despite the challenges and uncertain future. Thriving in academic medicine involved remaining flexible and managing change and chaos.

Mentoring and the career satisfaction of male and female academic medical faculty,Decastro R.; ; Griffith K.A.; Ubel P.A.; Stewart A.; Jagsi R.,"Purpose: To explore aspects of mentoring that might influence medical faculty career satisfaction and to discover whether there are gender differences. <ovid:br/>METHOD(S): In 2010-2011, the authors surveyed 1,708 clinician-researchers who received (in 2006-2009) National Institutes of Health K08 and K23 awards, which provided mentoring for career development. The authors compared, by gender, the development and nature of mentoring relationships, mentor characteristics, extent of mentoring in various mentor roles, and satisfaction with mentoring.

Although there are few gender differences in academic ability, some gender differences in occupational goals and interests persist, particularly in science and mathematics. These gender differences may be due to parental or cultural expectations, changes in developmental trends, stereotypes and discrimination, or gendered-expectations to achieve work-family balance.

Women in Academic Science: A Changing Landscape,"Ceci, SJ; Ginther, DK; Kahn, S; Williams, WM","Much has been written in the past two decades about women in academic science careers, but this literature is contradictory. Many analyses have revealed a level playing field, with men and women faring equally, whereas other analyses have suggested numerous areas' in which the playing field is not level. The only widely-agreed-upon conclusion is that women are underrepresented in college majors, graduate school programs, and the professoriate in those fields that are the most mathematically intensive, such as geoscience, engineering, economics, mathematics/computer science, and the physical sciences. In other scientific fields (psychology, life science, social science), women are found in much higher percentages.In this monograph, we undertake extensive life-course analyses comparing the trajectories of women and men in math-intensive fields with those of their counterparts in non-math-intensive fields in which women are close to parity with or even exceed the number of men. We begin by examining early-childhood differences in spatial processing and follow this through quantitative performance in middle childhood and adolescence, including high school coursework. We then focus on the transition of the sexes from high school to college major, then to graduate school, and, finally, to careers in academic science.The results of our myriad analyses reveal that early sex differences in spatial and mathematical reasoning need not stem from biological bases, that the gap between average female and male math ability is narrowing (suggesting strong environmental influences), and that sex differences in math ability at the right tail show variation over time and across nationalities, ethnicities, and other factors, indicating that the ratio of males to females at the right tail can and does change. We find that gender differences in attitudes toward and expectations about math careers and ability (controlling for actual ability) are evident by kindergarten and increase thereafter, leading to lower female propensities to major in math-intensive subjects in college but higher female propensities to major in non-math-intensive sciences, with overall science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at 50% female for more than a decade. Post-college, although men with majors in math-intensive subjects have historically chosen and completed PhDs in these fields more often than women, the gap has recently narrowed by two thirds; among non-math-intensive STEM majors, women are more likely than men to go into health and other people-related occupations instead of pursuing PhDs.Importantly, of those who obtain doctorates in math-intensive fields, men and women entering the professoriate have equivalent access to tenure-track academic jobs in science, and they persist and are remunerated at comparable rates with some caveats that we discuss. The transition from graduate programs to assistant professorships shows more pipeline leakage in the fields in which women are already very prevalent (psychology, life science, social science) than in the math-intensive fields in which they are underrepresented but in which the number of females holding assistant professorships is at least commensurate with (if not greater than) that of males. That is, invitations to interview for tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields as well as actual employment offers reveal that female PhD applicants fare at least as well as their male counterparts in math-intensive fields.Along these same lines, our analyses reveal that manuscript reviewing and grant funding are gender neutral: Male and female authors and principal investigators are equally likely to have their manuscripts accepted by journal editors and their grants funded, with only very occasional exceptions. There are no compelling sex differences in hours worked or average citations per publication, but there is an overall male advantage in productivity. We attempt to reconcile these results amid the disparate claims made regarding their causes, examining sex differences in citations, hours worked, and interests.We conclude by suggesting that although in the past, gender discrimination was an important cause of women's underrepresentation in scientific academic careers, this claim has continued to be invoked after it has ceased being a valid cause of women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields. Consequently, current barriers to women's full participation in mathematically intensive academic science fields are rooted in pre-college factors and the subsequent likelihood of majoring in these fields, and future research should focus on these barriers rather than misdirecting attention toward historical barriers that no longer account for women's underrepresentation in academic science.",2014,,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST,15,3,75-141,WOS:000344977700002,10.1177/1529100614541236,,#245,Ceci 2014,"",""

How these factors influence the gender gap in neurosurgery remains unclear. This analysis investigated gender differences in pediatric neurosurgeons in professional and nonprofessional activities and responsibilities. METHODS: A survey examining professional activities, work-life balance, family dynamics, career satisfaction, and workplace discrimination and harassment was administered to 495 pediatric neurosurgeons. Response rate was 49% (n = 241). RESULTS: One-third of the pediatric neurosurgical workforce is female. There were no gender differences in race/ethnicity, American Board of Neurological Surgery/American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery certification rates, or pediatric neurosurgery fellowship completion. No gender differences were found in operative caseload, weekly hours worked, or working after 8 pm or weekends. Women took call more frequently than men (P = .044). Men were more likely to work in academia (P = .004) and have salary subsidization from external sources (P = .026). Women were more likely to anticipate retirement by age 65 years (P = .044), were less happy with call commitments (P = .012), and worked more hours at home while off (P = .050). Women more frequently reported witnessing and experiencing racial discrimination (P = .008; P < .001), sexual harassment (P = .002, P < .001), and feeling less safe at work (P < .001). Men were more likely married (P = .042) with 1 (P = .004) or more children (P = .034). Women reported significantly greater responsibility for child and domestic care (P < .001). There were no gender differences in work-life balance, feeling supported at work, or having enough time to do things outside of work. CONCLUSION: Despite little difference in workload and professional responsibilities, women held more domestic responsibilities and experienced and witnessed more racial and sexual discrimination in the workplace.

Methods: This study is based on 21 biographical interviews to female physicians who are managers in Italian hospitals. The themes emerged by data analysis concerned the participants 'discrimination experiences in their hierarchical advancement, the evidences of a persistence of horizontal segregation in some medical specializations, the difficult to find a work-life balance and the effects of this difficult on the female physicians' health. Results: Our research confirmed a persistence of gender gap in the medical world, which disadvantages women in their career choices and in their hierarchical advancement and which appears in the form of invisible barriers impregnated of stereotypes and prejudices that are taken for granted by many men and women, especially those who have the power; these barriers make the female doctors 'health more vulnerable to the event of work-related stress.

Operational Constraints and Gender Biases: A Qualitative Analysis of Physician Parenting Experiences,"Lee, H; Burrows, HL; Singer, K; Brower, KJ; Bradford, CR; Spencley, B; Owens, L; Morgan, HK","Objective: Although parenting responsibilities are correlated with gender disparities in professional development and salary, the nature of parental challenges is not well characterized. The aims of this study were to (1) illuminate faculty physicians' experiences with parenting and (2) identify system challenges and opportunities for improvement.Materials and Methods: In October 2019, a survey about parenting was sent to all physician faculty at a large Midwest academic medical center. Qualitative analysis of free-text response to the survey item ""is there anything you wish to share about your experience of pregnancy or parenting as a physician"" was performed. Themes were inductively identified and developed from the responses in a team-based iterative approach.Results: Of 2069 total physician faculty, 1085 (52.4%) responded to the survey and 253 (23%) of the respondents provided free-text comments. From these comments, the authors identified three themes as sources of challenges for physician parents: operational constraints, gender biases, and nontraditional or nonheteronormative family structures. Operational factors pertained to lack of scheduling flexibility, childcare challenges, lactation, colleague coverage, and transparency of policies. Responses indicated that gender biases are encountered by all genders, and expectations built on assumptions of ""traditional"" gender roles and family structure are problematic for many physician parents.Conclusion: Addressing the challenges and opportunities identified in the study is critical to building a more supportive institutional culture around parenting and to increase gender parity in academic medicine.",2022,,WOMENS HEALTH REPORTS,3,1,297-306,WOS:000892383100037,10.1089/whr.2021.0099,,#252,Lee 2022,"",""
"Still a ""Stalled Revolution""?

This article also discusses efforts to ""unstall"" the gender revolution. Pop culture solutions on the individual-level and academic research on structural/cultural barriers often focus on women's access to historically ""masculine"" roles (e. g. representation in STEM fields). There is far less emphasis on men's involvement in historically ""feminine"" roles. Gender scholars examine hegemonic masculinity as the narrowly constrained expectations for men's ""appropriate"" behavior. While efforts to ""unstall"" the gender revolution focus largely on expanding women's opportunities, this article addresses why the gender revolution will remain incomplete and ""stalled"" without redefining hegemonic masculinity.

Fleeing the Ivory Tower: Gender Differences in the Turnover Experiences of Women Faculty,"Martinez, LR; O'Brien, KR; Hebl, MR","Purpose: Prior research has established that women and men faculty have different experiences in their professional and personal lives and that academic turnover can be costly and disruptive to home institutions. However, relatively little research has examined gender differences in the antecedent events that contributed to faculty members' voluntary turnover decisions. This study aims to fill this gap. Materials and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained in two ways: by directly contacting faculty members who had voluntarily left their positions through the human resource departments at six institutions and through more wide-scale snowball sampling. The surveys, administered via paper or web based, measured the extent to which participants' experiences with harassment/discrimination, family-related issues, and recruitment/retention offers impacted their decisions to leave. Qualitative data were coded by raters into numerical values, and mean differences based on gender were assessed for these and the quantitative data. Results: Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest that female academicians reported experiencing significantly more gender-based harassment/discrimination, were much more likely to cite family-related reasons for leaving, and reported receiving significantly fewer external job offers and internal retention offers than their male counterparts. Conclusions: Academic science departments should be keenly aware of and strive to reduce instances of harassment/discrimination against female academicians, offer more support for family-related issues and encourage faculty to take advantage of these programs, and conduct search and retention efforts fairly regardless of faculty gender.",2017,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,26,5,580-586,WOS:000401623900024,10.1089/jwh.2016.6023,,#260,Martinez 2017,"",""

Concurrently, the percentage of surgeons in dual-profession partnerships is increasing. We sought to evaluate the gender differences in professional advancement, work-life balance, and satisfaction at a large academic center.Materials and methods: All surgical trainees and faculty at a single academic medical center were surveyed. Collected variables included gender, academic rank, marital status, family size, division of household responsibilities, and career satisfaction. Student t-test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test were used to compare results.Results: There were 127 faculty and 116 trainee respondents (> 80% response rate). Respondents were mostly male (77% of faculty, 58% of trainees). Women were more likely than men to be married to a professional (90% versus 37%, for faculty; 82% versus 41% for trainees, P < 0.001 for both) who was working full time(P< 0.001) and were less likely to be on tenure track (P = 0.002).

In the quest for gender equity, medicine, with its abundance of highly educated and qualified women, should be leading the way. The sheer number of women who comprise the majority of pediatricians in the United States suggests this specialty has a unique opportunity to stand out as progressively equitable. Indeed, there has been much progress to celebrate for women in medicine and pediatrics. However, many challenges remain, and there are areas in which progress is too slow, stalled, or even regressing. The fair treatment of women pediatricians will require enhanced and simultaneous commitment from leaders in 4 key gatekeeper groups: academic medical centers, hospitals, health care organizations, and practices; medical societies; journals; and funding agencies.

"""Flying under the radar"": Postfeminism and teaching in academic science","Doerr, K","Neoliberal academia is marked by vertical and horizontal gender segregation, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is a particularly concerning case. Women with PhDs are underrepresented, and when they do participate, they are more likely than men to be in teaching-intensive roles. Beyond equality concerns, this is problematic because when women are interpreters rather than producers of disciplinary knowledge, the STEM enterprise remains gender-biased. Using data from a 2-year ethnography with physical science faculty in teaching-intensive roles, this paper argues that gender inequity is reproduced through postfeminist discourses of work-life balance. Participants who are mothers say they are flying under the radar at work. They self-surveille as they engage in both paid labor as university educators and unpaid carework at home. Importantly, when participants challenge hegemonic gender norms, they attract the radar's attention and are sanctioned.

This chapter focuses on the connection between the masculinist culture of organizations, how work is carried out, and workplaces are set up, illuminating the crucial role played by the built environment in maintaining gender equality. Infrastructure, spatial design, safety measures, amenities, and the biased culture often influence the obstacles to women's long-term success in the workplace. This chapter investigates and comprehends the constraints female employees encounter in Bangladesh during their work by scrutinizing the influence of the physical space and the biased socio-psychological environment. As women's long-term professional progress depends on how these elements are interrelated, improving the environment is the first step toward a fairer and more empowered work environment.

Understanding gender inequality and the role of the work/family interface in contemporary academia: An introduction,"Dubois-Shaik, F; Fusulier, B","This double special issue gathers a series of nuanced critically conceptual and case-study research showing that in the contemporary European context, despite regional differences in gender regimes, political and economic demands and organizational cultures, work/life balance policies and their translation into practice remains a highly ambiguous issue. Although work/life balance policies have undoubtedly entered the university institutional spaces, they are deterred by opposing institutional policy logics and particularly greedy' logics of the organizing of work that still aligns to outdated work-exclusive masculine organizational culture (outdated because men too are suffering the effects, and because the academic environment is feminized). Moreover, there are lingering gender stereotypes around the value and attribution of home and work duties, which are having a significant impact upon women's professional and private spheres and experiences in academic work. The gathered research shows how university institutions are still quite far from having addressed the core issues that undermine women's career advancement and their possibilities to access to academic membership and leadership, still obliging them (and their male counterparts) to align with a work and membership (selection and progression) logic and organization that does not take into consideration parenthood, family and personal spheres of life.",2017,,EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,16,2-3,99-105,WOS:000401913300001,10.1177/1474904117701143,,#278,Dubois-Shaik 2017,"",""
Women Physical Education Teacher Education Faculty's Experiences in Japan and the United States,"Tsuda, E; Ogiwara, T; Murai, R; Wyant, J; Watanabe, R; Chen, YJ","The purpose of this study was to explore women physical education teacher education faculty's experiences in Japan and the United States, using an exploratory descriptive case study design. The conceptual framework of the faculty's job satisfaction underpinned the study. A criterion sampling approach was employed to recruit participants. In total, seven Japanese and eight U.S. women faculty members took part in the study. Data were collected from a survey and a semistructured interview. The semistructured interviews served as the primary source of data. The survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the frequency of the responses was calculated. An inductive thematic analysis was employed to analyze the interview responses. Triangulation, member checking, and peer debriefing ensured the trustworthiness of the data. Relative to overall job satisfaction, the U.S. faculty tend to have higher satisfaction levels in teaching achievement, research expectations, and research productivity compared to Japanese faculty. Four themes were identified from the interview responses: (a) persisting social norms and stereotypes toward women, (b) women's representation matters, (c) juggling dual roles of being faculty and a mother, and (d) lack of support for mothers at work. This study provided the first evidence of women faculty members' experiences and perspectives in the field of physical education teacher education in Japan and the United States.

Gender Differences and Work-Family Conflicts among Emergency Physicians with Intention to Leave,"Wu, YF; Wang, PC; Chen, YC","Backgrounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among intention to leave, emergency physician clinical activities, work-family conflicts, and gender differences in emergency physicians (EPs). Methods. The survey instrument was a self-administered questionnaire containing basic demographic information and characteristics of clinical activities. The work-family conflicts were assessed by the Chinese version of the work-family conflict (WIF) scale. The questionnaires were mailed to board-certified EPs between January 2014 and August 2014. Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test the difference between subgroups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with intention to leave and gender differences. Results. The study included 222 respondents for analysis after exclusions. Compared with physicians not planning to leave, those planning to leave ED practice showed higher dissatisfaction with their clinical work hours (50.0% versus 31.4%, p = 0.035) and night/day shift ratio (52.9% versus 31.0%, p = 0.013) and tended to work with night/day shift ratio exceeding 40% (67.6% versus 45.7%, p = 0.019). Female physicians were more likely to leave ED practice (females versus males, 26.5% versus 10.1%, p = 0.008). A significantly higher level of WIF scale was noted in the group with intention to leave ED practice (3.7 +/- 0.6 versus 3.3 +/- 0.7, p = 0.001). Conclusions. Females and EPs with higher level of WIF scale were more likely to leave emergency clinical practice. Instead of the number of clinical practice hours, the satisfaction with the clinical work hours and night shift frequency were significantly associated with the intention to leave.",2018,,EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL,2018,,,WOS:000449938700001,10.1155/2018/3919147,,#280,Wu 2018,"",""
STRATEGIES OF ACADEMIC PARENTS TO MANAGE WORK-LIFE CONFLICT IN RESEARCH ABROAD,"Lubitow, A; Zippel, K","Purpose - This chapter identifies the challenges that faculty with children experience as they engage in international research. We explore how these faculty members manage the competing demands of international research work and parenthood.Methodology - Data includes qualitative interviews with 42 faculty members who are parents, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields from 23 Research 1 universities.Findings - The globalizing nature of research poses insufficiently recognized tensions between international travel and caregiving. Faculty reported three main strategies that enable them to manage work-family conflicts when work takes them abroad. These include: (1) opting out of international research; (2) modifying international travel; and (3) merging international research with caregiving.Research implications - Work-family conflicts identified at the national level are amplified for international research.Research limitations - Interview data are self-reports of what faculty members recalled and elected to share; actual behaviors may differ somewhat.Practical implications - This chapter provides insights that academic institutions might use to support faculty engaged in international research.Social implications - A failure to understand and support the unique needs of parents in international research settings may compromise active parenthood for faculty, while reinscribing and reinforcing existing gendered disparities in academia. The internationalization of STEM fields, when coupled with a lack of institutional support for parents, presents a mechanism that contributes to the ongoing underrepresentation of women in science and engineering.Originality - Although similar questions have been considered in national contexts, little research has explored work-family conflicts for parents in an international setting.",2014,,GENDER TRANSFORMATION IN THE ACADEMY,19,,63-84,WOS:000402721800005,10.1108/S1529-21262014000001900310.1108/S1529-2126201419,,#281,Lubitow 2014,"",""
Academic Gender Disparity in Orthopedic Surgery in Canadian Universities,"Yue, T; Khosa, F","IntroductionAcademic medicine is notorious for being ""male-dominated."" We hypothesized that there were significant and quantifiable levels of gender disparity in academic orthopedic surgery, and this article attempts to quantify the extent of the existing disparity. Also, we examined the research productivity of academic faculty in orthopedic surgery and its correlation with academic ranks and leadership positions.MethodsOur study design was cross-sectional in nature. We searched the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) to compile a list of medical schools that offer orthopedic surgery training for residency. A total of 713 academic orthopedic surgeons met our inclusion criteria. Of the 713 orthopedic surgeons, 518 had an H-index score available on Elsevier's Scopus (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The gender, academic rank, leadership position, and H-index were compared. Data analysis was done with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM, Armonk, NY). The binomial negative regression was used to compare the average H-index between men and women at each rank.ResultsOur study results reveal that academic orthopedic surgery in Canada is male-dominated, with men holding 87% of the academic positions. Female academic orthopedic surgeons held lower academic ranks, such as assistant professor or lecturer. Women orthopedic surgeons had lower H-index scores compared to their counterparts in ranks above the assistant professor. Our findings imply that research productivity and the ratio of average H-index scores comparing men to women (HM/HF) grow larger with each academic rank. At a 90% confidence level, women were less likely to hold leadership positions than men at an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 [90% confidence interval (CI): 0.29-0.925, p: 0.03]. There were no significant differences in Hindex between men and women for departmental leadership positions.ConclusionWomen were underrepresented in number, rank, and academic productivity (H-index).

Intention to Leave Emergency Medicine: Mid-career Women Are at Increased Risk,"Lall, MD; Perman, SM; Garg, N; Kohn, N; Whyte, K; Gips, A; Madsen, T; Baren, JM; Linden, J","Introduction: Burnout is prevalent among emergency physicians and may cause physicians to consider leaving the practice of emergency medicine (EM). This study sought to determine whether there is a gender difference in reporting burnout and seriously considering leaving the specialty of EM, and secondarily to explore the factors reported as contributing to burnout.Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the 2014 American Board of Emergency Medicine Longitudinal Survey of Emergency Physicians. We used multiple logistic regression to determine which factors were associated with reporting serious consideration of leaving EM, when stratified by years in practice and adjusting for individual, departmental, and institutional factors.Results: The response rate was 82%, (n = 868); 22.6% (194) were female and 77.4% (664) were males; and 83.9% (733) White. The mean age of men responding was significantly higher than women (52.7 +/- 11.9 vs. 44.9 +/- 10.4, p<0.001). Overall, there were no significant gender differences in reporting having had serious thoughts of leaving EM in either unmatched or age-matched analyses. More women reported that burnout was a significant problem, while men more often were equivocal as to whether it was a problem. When stratified by years in practice, mid-career women had a sevenfold increase in the odds ratio (OR) of seriously considered leaving EM, compared to men of similar years in practice (OR 7.07, 95% confidence interval, 2.45-20.39). Autonomy at work, control over working conditions, fair compensation, personal reward, and a sense of ownership were factors associated with a lower rate of reporting considering leaving EM.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the intention to leave EM is not more prevalent in women. However, mid-career women more often reported seriously considering leaving the specialty than mid-career men. Further research on the factors behind this finding in mid-career women in EM is needed.",2020,,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,21,5,1131-1139,WOS:000569586300018,10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47313,,#284,Lall 2020,"",""

"Gender, family and academic careers in Turkey","Inanc, H; Özcan, B","Turkey has a remarkably high proportion of female full professors in its universities and in scientific fields (STEM) that are traditionally dominated by men in other countries. This could reflect a great deal of occupational gender equality but there has been a debate whether this equality came at the expense of family life. With the expansion of academia in the late 1990s and the erosion of childcare availability, whether institutional or familial, more recent cohorts of female academics may be paying a greater family penalty than their predecessors. We investigate these conjectures using the Turkish Academic Career Survey (TAC) - an original retrospective life -history study conducted in 2007 with a representative sample of around 4500 academics. We focus on the relationship between career progression and the family transitions of academics and analyze whether this relationship varies by scientific field and if professors advanced in rank during different stages of higher education's expansion in Turkey. We find a considerable gender gap in family formation outcomes of Turkish academics in all fields. Furthermore, we find that female academics that completed their PhDs after 1999 were not considerably at a higher risk of postponing parenthood compared to those who obtained their PhD's before the higher education expansion occurred.

Methods Experts in the field of economics developed a questionnaire with scientific focus on the leaky pipeline among rheumatologists, which was distributed electronically by national scientific societies of EULAR countries and by individual contacts. We performed common factor analysis, univariate t-tests and multivariate regression analyses to appraise our dataset. Results A total of 311 hospital-based rheumatologists from 23/45 EULAR countries (52.7% females, 47.3% males) answered the questionnaire.

Does Gender of Administrator Matter? National Study Explores US University Administrators' Attitudes About Retaining Women Professors in STEM,"Williams, WM; Mahajan, A; Thoemmes, F; Barnett, SM; Vermeylen, F; Cash, BM; Ceci, SJ","Omnipresent calls for more women in university administration presume women will prioritize using resources and power to increase female representation, especially in STEM fields where women are most underrepresented. However, empirical evidence is lacking for systematic differences in female vs. male administrators' attitudes. Do female administrators agree on which strategies are best, and do men see things differently? We explored United States college and university administrators' opinions regarding strategies, policies, and structural changes in their organizations designed to increase women professors' representation and retention in STEM fields. A comprehensive review of past research yielded a database of potentially-effective, recommended policies. A survey based on these policies was sent to provosts, deans, associate deans, and department chairs of STEM fields at 96 public and private research universities across the U.S. These administrators were asked to rate the quality and feasibility of each strategy; 474 provided data, of which 334 contained complete numerical data used in the analyses. Our data revealed that female (vs. male) administrators believed the 44 strategies were higher in quality overall-but not higher in feasibility-with 9 strategies perceived differently by women and men, after imposing conservative statistical controls. There was broad general agreement on the relative-quality rankings of the 44 strategies. Women (vs. men) gave higher quality ratings to increasing the value of teaching, service, and administrative experience in tenure/promotion decisions, increasing flexibility of federal-grant funding to accommodate mothers, conducting gender-equity research, and supporting shared tenure lines enabling work-life balance. Women (vs. men) believed it was more feasible for men to stop the tenure clock for 1 year for childrearing and for universities to support requests for shared tenure lines, but less feasible for women to chair search committees. Our national survey thus supported the belief that placing women into administration creates greater endorsement of strategies to attract and retain women in STEM, although the effectiveness of these strategies was outside the scope of this research.

Stress and anxiety in orthodontic residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"Khoo, E; Saeed, SG; Chiu, HY; Quach, V; Janal, M; Stewart, K","Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had far-reaching effects on health care providers and health professional students; however, little is known about the factors related to stress and anxiety levels, specifically among orthodontic residents during this time. Methods: A 2-part questionnaire, which included modified stress and anxiety inventories, was disseminated electronically to U.S. orthodontic residents between June and July 2020. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: Overall, 261 participants responded (56% female), representing a response rate of 26.8%. Significant gender differences were found in 18 stress items, with female respondents expressing more stress than their male counterparts. Only 1 stress item (ie, fear of being unable to catch up if behind) varied as a function of the difference on the basis of respondents' stage in the program. First-year residents reported more stress in relation to this than more senior residents. Responses to all anxiety items but 1 item varied by gender, with females reporting higher scores. Residents in the middle stages of their program responded with higher anxiety scores with significant differences on 3 anxiety items. Conclusions: Although financial responsibilities and travel plans were the most stressful and anxiety-inducing items for orthodontic residents during the early aspect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, multiple items contributed to their stress and anxiety.

The Influence of Romantic Partners on Women in STEM Majors,"Barth, JM; Dunlap, S; Chappetta, K","It has been widely suggested that women are under-represented in STEM fields because careers in these fields are perceived as incompatible with other traditionally feminine roles and life goals such as helping others or maintaining a marriage and family. Although a number of studies of women in STEM have examined the importance of the communal goal of helping others, few studies have examined another communal goal, maintaining a romantic relationship. To address this gap, we designed a two-part study to explore the impact of romantic relationships on relationship and career goals of college STEM majors. First, a survey was conducted that examined the impact of relationship status on 713 male and 409 female college STEM majors' life goals and gender roles (82 % White). Although results indicated gender differences in goals and roles related to family and careers, interaction effects with relationship status that would suggest unique negative impacts on women's education or career goals were not found. Next, a subsample of 59 female STEM majors (81 % White) and their male romantic partners participated in a study examining their investments in and beliefs about careers, family, and the balance between the two. Findings suggest that successful female STEM majors may seek and find partners who are supportive of their educational and careers goals, as evidenced by the partners' investment and expectations for relationship and work roles. Overall, findings indicate that a supportive romantic partner may be a positive determining factor for women's success in STEM.",2016,,SEX ROLES,75,3-4,110-125,WOS:000379530500003,10.1007/s11199-016-0596-z,,#302,Barth 2016,"",""

Deferred Personal Life Decisions of Women Physicians,"Bering, J; Pflibsen, L; Eno, C; Radhakrishnan, P","Objective: Inadequate work-life balance can have significant implications regarding individual performance, retention, and on the future of the workforce in medicine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether women physicians defer personal life decisions in pursuit of their medical career. Materials and Methods: We conducted a survey study of women physicians ages 20-80 from various medical specialties using a combination of social media platforms and women physicians' professional listservs with 801 survey responses collected from May through November 2015. The primary endpoint was whether women physicians deferred personal life decisions in pursuit of their medical career. Secondary outcomes include types of decisions deferred and correlations with age, hours worked per week, specialty, number of children, and career satisfaction. Results: Respondents were categorized into deferred and nondeferred groups. Personal decision deferments were reported by 64% of respondents. Of these, 86% reported waiting to have children and 22% reported waiting to get married. Finally, while 85% of women in the nondeferment group would choose medicine again as a career, only 71% of women in the deferment group would do so (p<0.0001). Physicians who would choose medicine again cited reasons such as career satisfaction, positive patient interactions, and intellectual stimulation, whereas those who would not choose medicine again reported poor work-life balance, decreasing job satisfaction, and insurance/administrative burden. Conclusions: The results of this survey have significant implications on the future of the workforce in medicine. Overall, our analysis shows that 64% of women physicians defer important life decisions in pursuit of their medical career. With an increase in the number of women physicians entering the workforce, lack of support and deferred personal decisions have a potential negative impact on individual performance and retention.

Insights of Work-life Balance from Women's Perspective,"Sachdeva, S; Kaur, P; Aggarwal, L; Jain, T; Deswal, P","A rise in gender equality and women empowerment has led to women striving for financial independence with a wide variety of career choices. It is commonplace to witness women as accomplished academicians, educationalists, industrialists and entrepreneurs. This paper presents some insights into work-life balance from the perspective of women working in different sectors (education, industry and business). The study aims to exhibit an in-depth analysis of the challenges faced by women in their workplace, homes or society at large as well as how these challenges are being mitigated by the women from each sector. The methodology used in this study is as follows. Five women each were consulted from the sectors of technical education and IT industry along with five entrepreneurs before putting up the views in the current study. The findings reveal that overwhelmed workload, mental pressure and lack of concentration are major challenges during work-life balance. It has also been found that parenting, career-focusing and satisfaction (PCS) are three important parameters for a work-life balance for women in each sector. Based on the observations received from women participants across various sectors and rigorous analysis of literature study, a theorem named PCS has been proposed in the current research which states that it is difficult to achieve all three parameters simultaneously for maintaining a work-life balance. An analysis of experimental results from the existing literature is used to show that any woman can achieve excellence in at most two of the above three parameters. However, an effort can be made in this direction using the recommendations suggested in the study.",2022,,GENDER EQUITY: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES,,,427-440,WOS:000935765800045,10.1007/978-981-19-0460-8_45,,#307,Sachdeva 2022,"",""
"Children, care, career - a cross-sectional study on the risk of burnout among German hospital physicians at different career stages","Richter, A; Kostova, P; Harth, V; Wegner, R","Background: With the increasing number of female medical students physicians' need for work-life balanced hospital jobs rises at all career stages. The Working Time Act (Arbeitszeitgesetz, ArbZG), an implementation of the European Working Time Directive into German law in 2004, should have improved the general conditions for creating flexible work. Nevertheless, the vast majority of female physicians still report an incompatibility of work and family. So far, little is known about mothers working on leading positions in the medical field. The presented study focuses on gender differences in the level of emotional exhaustion between child-rearing junior and senior physicians and different predictors of burnout.Methods: Three years after the ArbZT-enactment, 994 physicians from the listed hospital physicians in the Medical Register of the city of Hamburg participated in the cross-sectional study and completed a 60-item questionnaire (return rate of 46,5%). The questionnaire included a 22-item version of the German translation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory whereat emotional exhaustion was interpreted as the crucial predictor of burnout. Results of an univariate covariance analysis and regression analyses are reported.Results: In the level of emotional exhaustion no gender differences were found between junior and senior physicians with children in the overall analysis. Support by the superior was the only overall predictor of burnout. Female senior physicians having children presented the highest risk of burnout. Only in this group parenting contributed significantly to the risk of burnout.Conclusions: Support by the superior and the relationship to colleagues are generally important predictors of burnout among hospital physicians. Parenthood only gets a crucial influence on psychomental health for female senior physicians. Still conservative role models are common in this group, thus dealing with the triple burden of work, leadership responsibility and child rearing seems to be a special female challenge.

THE NEW STEM FACULTY PROFILE: BALANCING FAMILY AND DUAL CAREERS,"Hill, PW; Holmes, MA; McQuillan, J","Purpose - This chapter contrasts ""ideal worker""with ""real worker""characteristics among STEM faculty in gendered organizations. The gap between the two reveals the need for academic institutions to revise the notion of and the policies for typical faculty members.Design - All STEM faculty at a Midwestern research intensive university were asked to participate in a mail and web-based survey to study faculty experiences within departments. The response rate was 70%. Faculty were then categorized by their employment, education, and parent status, and by the work status of their spouse/ partner, to assess how closely the faculty matched the ideal academic worker: a faculty member with a full-time home-maker partner.Findings - Only 13% of the surveyed STEM faculty resemble the ""ideal worker""by having a partner who is not employed and who ensures all family care giving. The vast majority of STEM faculty are men with an employed partner who is more likely to have a professional (33%) rather than a nonprofessional (22%) degree.Research limitations - Only one, public, research-intensive institution in the Midwest United States was surveyed and therefore findings cannot be generalized to faculty at other research intensive institutions or to other types of institutions.Practical implications - Rather than adding policies to attract women into academia, we find an urgent need make academic institutions rethink to match the reality of most faculty. Increasing flexibility in the academic workplace is not a ""women's issue""but a ""faculty issue.""Value - This paper provides evidence that supports institutional change to accommodate the new academic workers, most of whom are part of dual career couples.",2014,,GENDER TRANSFORMATION IN THE ACADEMY,19,,3-20,WOS:000402721800002,10.1108/S1529-21262014000001900110.1108/S1529-2126201419,,#312,Hill 2014,"",""

Lack of physician engagement promotes the opposite. This study sought to identify important facets contributing to decreased career satisfaction using a large national data set of practicing emergency physicians. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of the national Longitudinal Study of Emergency Physicians survey conducted by the American Board of Emergency Medicine. The survey was composed of 57 variables including career satisfaction as well as occupational and psychological variables potentially associated with career satisfaction. Factor analysis was used to determine the important latent variables. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to determine statistical significance among the latent variables with overall career satisfaction. Results A total of 863 participants were recorded. The overall mean career satisfaction rate was 3.9 on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 and 5 indicating ""least satisfied"" and ""most satisfied,"" respectively. Our analysis revealed 9 factors related to job satisfaction. Two latent factors, exhaustion/stress and administration/respect, were statistically significant. When comparing satisfaction scores between sex, there was a statistically significant difference with men reporting a higher satisfaction rate (P = 0.0092). Age was also statistically significant with overall satisfaction lower for younger physicians than older physicians. Conclusion Our study found that emergency physicians are overall satisfied with emergency medicine, although with variability depending on sex and age. In addition, we characterized job satisfaction into 9 factors that significantly contribute to job satisfaction.

Cooperatives in Education: Teacher Job Satisfaction and Gender Differences,"Martínez-León, I; Olmedo-Cifuentes, I; Arcas-Lario, N; Zapata-Conesa, J","ObjectivesCooperatives whose activity is undertaken in the field of education need to optimize their management to survive and achieve competitive advantage. As they are labor-intensive organizations that provide services with high intangibility (transformation knowledge, characteristics and individuals' behavior), their staff's job satisfaction is one way of achieving these advantages (reputation, strategic positioning, attracting talented employees, etc.). Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze how education cooperatives can achieve job satisfaction through certain human resources management practices (work-life balance culture and availability of work-life balance practices, hiring, training, performance assessment and compensation). The gender perspective is also considered in the analysis.MethodologyAn empirical study conducted with the data obtained from a sample of 101 teachers from education cooperatives in the Murcia Region (Spain) (5% response rate). Data were collected by a personal survey that included measures used in previous studies. They were all assessed with a 7-point Likert scale (1: totally disagree, and 7: totally agree) according to teachers' perception of the different variables.Teachers' job satisfaction, measured according to: professional satisfaction (with the school and learning activities), satisfaction with student achievement, teachers' experience in the educational center, and treatment received by the center.Work-life balance culture, divided into positive and negative perspectives. The positive one includes: talking about personal life at work, starting a family -expecting a child or adopting it-, leaving the workplace to care for children or dependent family members, and prolonging maternity/paternity leave. The negative work-life balance culture includes: maintaining a family structure that requires a lot of involvement, spending many hours at work on a daily basis, taking work home regularly, and prioritizing work over private life.Work-life balance practices, with measures adapted to the context (education cooperatives) to specifically ask about a reduced working day with a cut in salary, maternity/paternity leave longer than the legal minimum, leave of absence to care for either sick or dependent family members or sick or dependent children.Hiring, assessed according to teachers' perception of if: recruiting processes that are rigorous and formalized, teachers' continuity is high, and appropriate teachers are hired at each school level.The variable training, measured by considering if training actions are carried out according to the teaching staff's needs, training plans are tailored to the teaching staff, and the training suggestions made by the teaching staff are taken into account.Performance assessment, to consider if the objectives to be met are communicated to those responsible for achieving them, the performance and development of each teacher's activity are evaluated, and if the evaluation of teachers' performance is adequate.Finally, the variable compensation includes the perception of whether the performance evaluation is linked to the salary paid, the salary paid is independent of the teaching staff's performance, and salaries are at similar to those paid to public school teachers.The descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations of the variables are included, as is a hierarchical linear regression model to test the hypotheses. The general model obtained with all the sample data is also analyzed by taking into account gender as a selection variable.ResultsThe study results reveal that adequate training (beta=.478) and rigorous formalized hiring (beta=.336) are the most valued factors to generate job satisfaction among teachers of education cooperatives in the Murcia Region. However, some gender differences appear in the variables that generate job satisfaction, despite there being no significant differences between male and female teachers' perception of their job satisfaction.In particular, male teachers (31% of the sample) negatively perceive the effect of availability of work-life balance practices (beta=-. 238) and compensation (beta=-. 374) on their job satisfaction, while training has a positive impact (beta=.706). These variables explain 52.6% of the male teachers' job satisfaction variation. For the female teachers (69% of the sample), hiring (beta=.440), training (beta=.345) and work-life balance practices (beta=.233) have a positive effect on their perceived job satisfaction, and explain 63.8% of the variation in their job satisfaction.From these gender results, the most striking aspect is that the greater availability of work-life balance practices and linking pay to performance reduce male teachers' job satisfaction. One explanation could be that males consider that work-life balance practices only benefit women, and when female teachers use these measures, male teachers must face a heavier workload, which affects their level of satisfaction. The negative relationship between satisfaction and performance assessment may be a consequence of the service type (training), and the possible uncertainty and mistrust that a performance measure can generate because the methods to determine it are not the most suitable ones, or do not reflect all the work they do to perform their teaching activity.Females differ for the idea that hiring and work-life balance practices are a key influence on their job satisfaction. Perhaps the females in the Spanish studied region still assume the reproduction and care role of the family to a greater extent, and the tools that support their labor participation, such as work-life balance practices, possibly have a positive effect on their perceived satisfaction. Additionally, hiring is the most important factor that generates job satisfaction among females. Rigorous formalized processes where the most appropriate candidates are hired, with a high probability of continuity, are well assessed by females as a way to assure gender equality and to banish certain gender stereotypes, occupational segregation (horizontal and vertical) and the glass ceiling.In any case, both males and females agree that training is essential for their job satisfaction, perhaps because this will improve the education service that they provide, as well as their students performing better.Practical conclusions and original valueThis work offers guidelines to education cooperatives about the aspects that create more job satisfaction, and how to manage and optimize it according to each employee's gender.This work shows some gender differences among teachers of educational cooperatives in relation to the variables that generate their job satisfaction. These differences must be carefully analyzed by the management of cooperatives in an attempt to develop those human resource management policies and strategies that tend to favor high job satisfaction among male and female teachers given its effect on other variables, e.g. performance (better service provision, perception of higher quality), productivity or the cooperative's outcomes (attracting new customers, better internal and external reputation, etc.).In general, education cooperatives can increase job satisfaction by mainly offering a training program suited to teachers' needs that can be put into practice, if possible, in their working hours, and that does not require travel, to avoid work-life conflict problems. This should be complemented with formalized rigorous hiring processes that ensure having highly trained motivated staff. The different perception of work-life practices between males and females shows a clear need for more training and awareness about work-life balance issues and co-responsibility. Educational cooperatives should put the necessary resources (hiring temporary staff to cover possible reductions in days, leave, or absence) so teachers' satisfaction (and productivity) does not disturb those situations.The importance of education cooperatives, together with their labor-intensive character and the absence of studies that analyze the problems addressed herein, justify their relevance from both the academic and business points of view.",2018,,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,94,,31-60,WOS:000455955600003,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.94.12700,,#319,Martínez-León 2018,"",""

""Workplace resources"" in our study refers to the presence of career education in the workplace, promotion of gender equity, well-being consultation services on ""career and work,"" ""research,"" ""harassment,"" and/or ""mental health,"" as well as the presence of a role model in the workplace who has perceived good work-life balance.ResultsAmong 408 physician-researchers (75% male, mean age 37yrs), personal burnout scores were slightly higher in women than in men (mean score, 41.9 points vs. 36.7 points, difference, 5.2, 95% confidence interval, 0.5-9.9, p=0.029), but work-related and patient-related burnout scores did not differ significantly between genders. Over half of women (64%) and men (58%) had a mentor (p=0.374). In multivariable general linear regression models, personal burnout scores were higher for women (beta =4.98, p=0.045), and lower among those who had a mentor (beta=-5.82, p=0.010) and whose workplaces had well-being consultation services (beta=-0.79, p=0.022). Work-related burnout scores were lower among those with larger amounts of grant funding (beta=-4.70, p=0.013), a mentor (beta=-6.12, p=0.002), well-being consultation services (beta=-0.78, p=0.008) and a role model with a perceived good work-life balance (beta=-4.00, p=0.038). Patient-related burnout scores were higher among physician-scientists aged older than 37years (beta =6.25, p=0.002) and those who had board certification (beta =9.01, p=0.017), while these scores were lower among those had larger amounts of funding (beta=-5.01, p=0.006) or a mentor (beta=-5.35, p=0.006).ConclusionsWorkplace resources and mentorship appear to be associated with lower levels of psychological burnout for both men and women early career physician-scientists.",2020,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,20,1,,WOS:000540032200001,10.1186/s12909-020-02072-x,,#322,Perumalswami 2020,"",""
Institutionalised patriarchy and work-life balance (WLB) challenges for female medical doctors: the case of Nigeria,"Nwagbara, U","Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine how institutionalised patriarchy triggers work-life-balance (WLB) challenges for Nigerian female medical doctors. It is focused on Nigeria to understand how its unique institutional context poses WLB challenges. Design/methodology/approach Relying on exploratory qualitative approach based on 41 semi-structured interviews with female medical doctors in Nigeria and informed by institutional theory (IT), this study explores how patriarchal institutions create, maintain and transmit male dominance, exploitation and inequality in the family, workplace and larger society. Findings The findings of this study show that patriarchy exists not only in family but also in all structures and institutions that allow for control of women by men and further inequality and exploitation of women. It was also found that in contrast to research in the west, WLB challenges stemming from Nigeria's patriarchal institutions are significantly different because of the peculiar institutional frameworks framing them. Also, WLB challenges for female physicians while common to female doctors in western countries are more intense in developing countries, given their unique sociocultural and institutional realities. Research limitations/implications The implications of this study are that WLB challenges of female doctors are not fundamentally driven by individual choices but by broader contextual issues, which create and sustain such challenges. Further studies can be undertaken in private hospitals including quantitative approaches. Originality/value This research thus contributes to both institutional theory and WLB discourse from the perspective of developing countries.",2021,,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,40,3,355-369,WOS:000592509800001,10.1108/EDI-11-2019-0273,,#323,Nwagbara 2021,"",""
Turnover Intentions in the STEM Fields: The Role of Departmental Factors,"Minnotte, KL; Pedersen, DE","The underrepresentation of women faculty in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) remains a persistent feature of academia, with turnover being a contributing factor. The departmental context is likely implicated in the decision to stay or leave, as it is one of the key defining features of faculty members' work experiences. Using the job-demands resources theoretical approach, this study examines how four facets of university departments - department climate, department chair support, perceived injustice, and scholarly isolation - are related to turnover intentions among STEM tenure-system faculty, along with whether these relationships differ by gender. Data are from STEM tenure-system faculty at a mid-sized university located in the upper Midwest (N = 117 faculty members). The findings indicate each facet of the department is related to STEM faculty members' turnover intentions, regardless of gender.

Women in science: The persistence of traditional gender roles.

However, albeit the number of female scientists has increased, true gender equality has yet to be achieved. When examining the reasons for this, we have to consider the interconnection between the expectations surrounding gender and what it means to work in the scientific profession, operating at individual, interactional, and institutional levels. This paper presents the results (and methods) of a survey exploring work-life interfaces from a gender-sensitive perspective.Our survey focused on the researchers and professors working in the medicine and engineering departments of the University of Pisa, where the gradient of female exclusion is most pronounced. The results allow for an interpretation of the leaky pipeline' (macro level), through a gender-sensitive analysis of gender-based social obligations and those associated with the scientific profession (micro perspective), by integrating said reading through a description of the dynamics of continuous negotiation in private and public life (university) (meso level).

Little is known, however, about how young women in STEM reason about future work-family conflict. The current study examines work-family conflict expectations among undergraduate and graduate women in STEM. Participants (N = 156) responded to open- and closed-ended survey questions about work-family conflict and academic attitudes. Qualitative analyses revealed two orientations relative to work-family conflict. Women with a challenge orientation anticipated work and family strain, whereas women with an opportunity orientation anticipated that balancing work and family would enhance their lives. Women differed in the strategies they planned to employ to resolve future work-family conflict and in their levels of quantitative constructs such as STEM identity.

"""Not all care is love"": The impact of love labour and care on the career trajectories of doctorate holders","Hjálmsdóttir, A; Rafnsdóttir, GL","Feminist scholars have argued that care and, by extension, care work, is the foundation of every society, as most social practices and economies rely on it. However, despite the importance of loving and caring, these activities often go unnoticed. This article studies the impact of having to provide care and love on the career trajectories of men and women doctorate holders working within and outside academia in Iceland, a country that has consistently topped the Gender Gap Index since 2009. The findings are based on interviews with 32 doctorate holders. By treating love labour and care as theoretical tools, the analysis revealed that the women interviewees perceived themselves to be responsible for most of their intimate love relationships and nurturing in their families. This is problematic, as love labour is not as easily outsourced as care work. Furthermore, the results showed that men were more likely to occupy certain care roles than to provide love labour. This affords them more time and mental space than is the case for women to establish their careers. While the men viewed this gendered division of labour as a matter of personal choice, the women felt that their options were limited, and experienced feelings of guilt.",2025,,FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY,,,,WOS:001393705700001,10.1177/09593535241307443,,#329,Hjálmsdóttir 2025,"",""

Digitalisation as a Prospect for Work-Life Balance and Inclusion: A Natural Experiment in German Hospitals,"Schongen, S","Digitalisation has a wide range of impacts on the workplace, such as enabling new work models with flexible work sched-ules, changing work content, or increasing workplace control. These changes directly affect not only individuals' work but also their private lives. Scholars theorise that digitalisation either enables or impedes workers' ability to maximise their work-life balance, which in turn fosters or inhibits the social inclusion of some societal groups and reduces or reproduces social inequalities. Focusing on the German healthcare sector, I explore the impact of using networked digital technologies on work-life balance, and whether it influences gender and educational inequalities. Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered. To assess the relationship between digitalisation and work-life balance, I use survey data from hospital employees on the use of networked digital technologies and individual outcomes. The research is designed as a natural experiment. The treatment group comprises employees at a university hospital equipped with cutting-edge networked digital tech-nologies (N = 1,117); the control group comprises employees at several church-owned hospitals (N = 415) with a level of digitalisation corresponding to the average for the sector.

Speciality preferences in Dutch medical students influenced by their anticipation on family responsibilities,"Alers, M; Pepping, T; Bor, H; Verdonk, P; Hamberg, K; Lagro-Janssen, A","Physician gender is associated with differences in the male-to-female ratio between specialities and with preferred working hours. We explored how graduating students' sex or full-time or part-time preference influences their speciality choice, taking work-life issues into account. Graduating medical students at Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands participated in a survey (2008-2012) on career considerations. Logistic regression tested the influence of sex or working hour preference on speciality choice and whether work-life issues mediate. Of the responding students (N = 1,050, response rate 83, 73.3 % women), men preferred full-time work, whereas women equally opted for part time. More men chose surgery, more women family medicine. A full-time preference was associated with a preference for surgery, internal medicine and neurology, a part-time preference with psychiatry and family medicine. Both male and female students anticipated that foremost the career of women will be negatively influenced by family life. A full-time preference was associated with an expectation of equality in career opportunities or with a less ambitious partner whose career would affect family life. This increased the likelihood of a choice for surgery and reduced the preference for family medicine among female students. Gender specifically plays an important role in female graduates' speciality choice making, through considerations on career prospects and family responsibilities.",2014,,PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION,3,6,443-454,WOS:000443138900005,10.1007/s40037-014-0149-5,,#344,Alers 2014,"",""
The changing career trajectories of new parents in STEM,"Cech, EA; Blair-Loy, M","The gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields has remained constant for decades and increases the farther up the STEM career pipeline one looks. Why does the underrepresentation of women endure? This study investigated the role of parenthood as a mechanism of gender-differentiated attrition from STEM employment. Using a nationally representative 8-year longitudinal sample of US STEM professionals, we examined the career trajectories of new parents after the birth or adoption of their first child. We found substantial attrition of new mothers: 43% of women leave full-time STEM employment after their first child. New mothers are more likely than new fathers to leave STEM, to switch to part-time work, and to exit the labor force. These gender differences hold irrespective of variation by discipline, race, and other demographic factors. However, parenthood is not just a ""mother's problem""; 23% of new fathers also leave STEM after their first child. Suggesting the difficulty of combining STEM work with caregiving responsibilities generally, new parents are more likely to leave full-time STEM jobs than otherwise similar childless peers and even new parents who remain employed full time are more likely than their childless peers to exit STEM for work elsewhere. These results have implications for policymakers and STEM workforce scholars; whereas parenthood is an important mechanism of women's attrition, both women and men leave at surprisingly high rates after having children. Given that most people become parents during their working lives, STEM fields must do more to retain professionals with children.",2019,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,116,10,4182-4187,WOS:000460242100043,10.1073/pnas.1810862116,,#345,Cech 2019,"",""
"Female specialists in intensive care medicine: job satisfaction, challenges and work-life balance","Hawker, FH","Objective: Women are under-represented in the intensive care medicine (ICM) specialist workforce. I aimed to better understand the challenges these women face so they can be considered in the training and support of ICM specialists.Design and participants: All female Fellows of the College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM) of Australia and New Zealand were surveyed using an online questionnaire. The study was approved by the Cabrini Human Research Ethics Committee. Thirty respondents with children volunteered to complete a second questionnaire.Main outcome measures: I surveyed demographic and workforce data and women's experiences in the ICM specialist workforce in the first survey, and experiences with child-rearing in the second survey.Results: The response rate was 80.3% (127/158). The median age bracket was 40-45 years, and 118 respondents were practising ICM, 85 full-time in a tertiary intensive care unit. Eighteen were ICU directors and 23 were CICM-appointed supervisors of training. Sixty-five women were mothers, and 70% returned to full-time work after their maternity leave. Child care was most commonly undertaken by family members or a nanny. Overall, 81 were satisfied with their experiences, but 37% felt they had been disadvantaged because of their sex. Fewer women with leadership roles felt disadvantaged. Their major challenges included the on-call work affecting child-rearing and family life, sexism in the workplace and difficulties with academic advancement.Conclusion: The participation and satisfaction rates of women working in the ICM specialist workforce are encouraging.

Stemming the 'Leaky Pipeline': an investigation of the relationship between work-family conflict and women's career progression in academic medicine,"James-McCarthy, K; Brooks-McCarthy, A; Walker, DM","Background Even though women outnumber men enrolled in medical school, making up 59% of entrants in the UK, they are significantly under-represented in academic medicine and senior positions. In the UK, 28.6% of academics overall are women. In the USA, while 51% of instructors are women, only 20% make it through the 'leaky pipeline' to become professors. One attributable factor is work-family conflict. The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between work-family conflict and women's career progression in academic medicine, and to provide a model to inform and change perceptions and practice in order to improve the 'leaky pipeline'. Methods A systematic literature search was performed to identify qualitative studies which investigated this relationship. Studies were critically appraised, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Themes identified in the data were used to develop a model to build on the understanding of this issue. Findings The findings of this research highlighted two main themes, one related to perceptions of gender (intrinsic or extrinsic), the way it impacts on work-family conflict and its relationship to women's career progression. The second theme relates to structures which hinder or support women's ability to have work-life balance. A model was developed that represents the inter-relationship between these factors.

Exploring Attractiveness of the Basic Sciences for Female Physicians,"Yamazaki, Y; Fukushima, S; Kozono, Y; Uka, T; Marui, E","In Japan, traditional gender roles of women, especially the role of motherhood, may cause early career resignations in female physicians and a shortage of female researchers. Besides this gender issue, a general physician shortage is affecting basic science fields. Our previous study suggested that female physicians could be good candidates for the basic sciences because such work offers good work-life balance. However, the attractiveness for female physicians of working in the basic sciences, including work-life balance, is not known. In a 2012 nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire survey, female physicians holding tenured positions in the basic sciences at Japan's medical schools were asked an open-ended question about positive aspects of basic sciences that clinical medicine lacks, and we analyzed 58 respondents' comments. Qualitative analysis using the Kawakita Jiro method revealed four positive aspects: research attractiveness, priority on research productivity, a healthy work-life balance, and exemption from clinical duties. The most consistent positive aspect was research attractiveness, which was heightened by medical knowledge and clinical experience. The other aspects were double-edged swords; for example, while the priority on research productivity resulted in less gender segregation, it sometimes created tough competition, and while exemption from clinical duties contributed to a healthy work-life balance, it sometimes lowered motivation as a physician and provided unstable income. Overall, if female physicians lack an intrinsic interest in research and seek good work-life balance, they may drop out of research fields. Respecting and cultivating students' research interest is critical to alleviating the physician shortage in the basic sciences.",2018,,TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,244,1,7-14,WOS:000424732000002,10.1620/tjem.244.7,,#350,Yamazaki 2018,"",""
Current perceptions and working time models of female urologists in Germany: results of a large-scale survey,"Weinberger, S; Welte, MN; Knipper, S; Siech, C; Greiser, EM; Wiemer, L; Mueller, K; Bellut, L; Herlemann, A; Schoenburg, S; Walach, MT","Purpose Female urologists are distinctly underrepresented in leading positions. The reasons behind this inequity remain unclear, with some suggesting factors such as family responsibilities, part-time work and insufficient mentorship. This study aimed to explore and characterize the working conditions of female urologists in Germany, with a focus on factors influencing the working time model.Methods A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 1343 female members of the German Society of Urology between February and March 2022. The survey consisted of 43 questions covering the categories demographics, occupation situation, satisfaction at work, family situation, career aspects and research activity.Results Of the 487 female German urologists who participated in the survey, 167 (34.3%) worked part-time. Doctors in training were significantly less likely to work part-time than colleagues who had completed their specialist training (p < 0.001). Only 10% of female doctors in training reported working part-time. Similarly, having children (p < 0.001) and engaging in scientific activities (p = 0.03) were independent factors influencing part-time work, with children increasing the likelihood of working part-time as expected, while scientifically active female urologists were more likely to work full-time.Conclusion This study provides the largest survey on the situation of female urologists in German-speaking countries to date. Part-time work during specialist training is rare, while more than 50% of female urologists with children work part-time.

GENDER IMBALANCE IN THE ACADEMY: OBJECTIVE STATISTICS AND SUBJECTIVE MEANINGS,"Tarakanovskaya, K","The article reveals the problems of work-life balance through the prism of statistical data of the educational and scientific sphere, and semantic constructs of gender imbalance through the concept of life and work balance. Statistical data demonstrate the gender gap with the advancement of the academic career ladder, and subjective meanings reveal that women who are engaged in science at the university are not inclined to declare a complete lack of opportunities for combining personal (family) life and motherhood, in fact, allow such a situation, but with some clauses. The possibility of combining personal life and academic career is reflected, but with certain reservations. They associate their identity primarily with the role of a mother, and in professional terms, more often with the role of a teacher, rather than a supervisor. At the same time, they note the vulnerable position of women in terms of career growth rates in the academic sphere. This is also reflected in the intra-university statistics of the distribution of the teaching staff by the availability of academic degrees. The case in this article shows that among men, professors and associate professors are more common (their careers are moving faster), while women are more likely to occupy the positions of a lecturer/senior lecturer. When choosing a family, women choose a career as a teacher, which allows them to optimize the time spent on work and household duties. Academic sphere puts additional pressure on women, demanding maximum scientific productivity, without actually providing any support from the intra-university social policy. The study showed that there are no formal restrictions for women in building an academic career, but there are implicit gender barriers due to both institutional characteristics and the normative type of family, motherhood and fatherhood.",2022,,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES,20,1,53-66,WOS:000929011900005,10.17323/727-0634-2022-20-1-53-66,,#353,Tarakanovskaya 2022,"",""
Physician job satisfaction related to actual and preferred job size,"Schmit Jongbloed, LJ; Cohen-Schotanus, J; Borleffs, JCC; Stewart, RE; Schonrock-Adema, J","Background: Job satisfaction is essential for physicians' well-being and patient care. The work ethic of long days and hard work that has been advocated for decades is acknowledged as a threat for physicians' job satisfaction, well-being, and patient safety. Our aim was to determine the actual and preferred job size of physicians and to investigate how these and the differences between them influence physicians' job satisfaction.Method: Data were retrieved from a larger, longitudinal study among physicians starting medical training at Groningen University in 1982/83/92/93 (N = 597). Data from 506 participants (85%) were available for this study. We used regression analysis to investigate the influence of job size on physicians' job satisfaction (13 aspects) and ANOVA to examine differences in job satisfaction between physicians wishing to retain, reduce or increase job size.Results: The majority of the respondents (57%) had an actual job size less than 1.0 FTE. More than 80% of all respondents preferred not to work full-time in the future. Respondents' average actual and preferred job sizes were.85 FTE and .81 FTE, respectively. On average, respondents who wished to work less (35% of respondents) preferred a job size reduction of 0.18 FTE and those who wished to work more (12%) preferred an increase in job size of 0.16 FTE. Job size influenced satisfaction with balance work-private hours most (beta = -.351). Physicians who preferred larger job sizes were - compared to the other groups of physicians - least satisfied with professional accomplishments.Conclusions: A considerable group of physicians reported a gap between actual and preferred job size.

No Room for Balancing: Mothers and Professors in Czech Maternity Hospitals,"Smídová, I","The paper analyses the complex issue of work-life balance in the medical setting of Czech maternity hospitals. The issue of work-life balance has not been dealt with adequately; the organisation of professional careers in medicine is understood in terms of making sacrifices for the profession. However, analysis of the everyday lives of members of the profession provides insight into the practices and strategies that are adopted for coping with demanding work and gender prejudices, and the striving to create a satisfactory personal life. The article targets the structural mechanisms that reproduce Czech hospital gender regimes and their effects on work-life balance according to the individual coping strategies of the actors involved. These are conceptually framed using the symbolic system of the gender universe (Harding, 1987) and the theory of gendered organisations (Acker, 1990). The empirical data used in the analysis comes from qualitative research (2011-2014) into Czech reproductive medicine, specifically obstetrics. It is primarily based on in-depth interviews with senior physicians, although other data sources were also utilised. Physicians' own reflections of the current status quo in Czech hospitals are critically assessed and framed in a structural context with reference to the broader social mechanisms that re/produce gender in/equality in the labour market.",2016,,INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS,2,3,42-60,WOS:000407649100003,10.17356/ieejsp.v2i3.186,,#356,Smídová 2016,"",""
Work-life balance in Europe: institutional contexts and individual factors,"Stoilova, R; Ilieva-Trichkova, P; Bieri, F","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how individual and macro-level factors shape the work-life balance of young men and women across European countries. Design/methodology/approach The paper combines macro-level data from the official statistics with individual-level data from the Work, Family and Wellbeing (2010/2011) module of the European Social Survey. The study uses multilevel modelling to explore the factors which shape the work-life balance of men and women aged 15-34 across 24 European countries. Findings The findings show both differences and similarities between young men and women in how education shapes work-life balance. Higher education increases the likelihood of considering work-life balance as important in work selection for men, while lower education decreases the odds of considering this balance for women. More education is associated with lower acceptance of the traditional norm, for both men and women, and less time spent on housework. Higher share of family benefits decreases the importance of work-life balance, more so for men than for women. Work-life balance is more important for men living in conservative, Mediterranean and post-socialist welfare regimes compared to those from social-democratic regimes. Social implications - The policy implications are to more closely consider education in the transformation of gender-sensitive norms during earlier stages of child socialization and to design more holistic policy measures which address the multitude of barriers individuals from poor families and ethnic/migrant background face. Originality/value The study contributes to existing literature by applying the capability approach to the empirical investigation of work-life balance. The analytical model contains three dimensions - norms about paid/unpaid work, considering work-life balance in the choice of employment and time spent on unpaid work.

The increasing number of women in medicine, particularly in the field of urology, raises questions about the compatibility of family and career, especially concerning the work environment and working time models. ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to capture the impact of motherhood on the professional lives of female physicians and scientists in the field of urology in Germany. Specific challenges in this surgical specialty and the compatibility of family and career will be highlighted. MethodsThe working group ""Female Physicians and Scientists in Urology"" of the German Society of Urology (DGU) surveyed its 1343 female members regarding demographic data, professional status, and aspects of work-life balance. ResultsAmong 487 female urologists in Germany, 53.4% had children. Mothers tended to be older, less frequently in training, less often in inpatient settings, and less frequently engaged in surgical activities. Notably, the proportion of full-time working mothers (36.2%) was significantly lower compared to female urologists without children (92.4%). Among female urologists with children, 32.3% reported having changed their workplace because of their children, while 10.7% indicated that their responsibilities had changed at least once after pregnancy. Additionally, 76.9% of mothers had reduced their weekly working hours due to family commitments. Multivariate analysis showed an influence of motherhood on professional status and parttime work. ConclusionThe fact that starting a family for women in urology in Germany is associated with a reduction in working hours and the end of clinical careers suggests a need for optimizing the compatibility of family and career in Germany. The increasing feminization of the medical profession exacerbates the existing shortage of skilled workers due to the exit of mothers from professional life.

However, there is no clear consensus on the terms, definitions, or measures used in physician work-personal intersection (WPI) research. In this scoping review, the authors aimed to describe the terms and definitions used by researchers to describe physician WPI, summarize the measurement tools used, and formulate a conceptual model of WPI that can inform future research.MethodThe authors searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that investigated U.S. practicing physicians' WPI and measured WPI as an outcome from January 1990 to March 2022. The authors applied thematic analysis to all WPI terms, definitions, and survey questions or prompts in the included studies to create a conceptual model of physician WPI.ResultsUltimately, 102 studies were included in the final analysis. The most commonly used WPI terms were work-life balance, work-life integration, and work-home or work-life conflict(s). There was no consistency in the definition of any terms across studies.

Objective: Our objective was to perform a 10-year follow-up descriptive assessment of the availability of flexible work-life policies for faculty in medical schools in the Big Ten Conference. Design: In this descriptive study, a modified objective scoring system was used to evaluate the flexibility of faculty work-life policies at 13 medical schools in the Big Ten Conference. Policy information was obtained from institutional websites and verified with the human resources offices. Scores from the 2011 study and 2020 were compared. Results: Michigan State and Ohio State Universities offered the most flexible policies (score 17.75/22) with the University of Michigan following (score 16.75/22). The largest delta scores, indicating more flexible policies in the past decade, were at University of Michigan (6) and University of Minnesota (5.25). Policies for parental leave and part-time faculty varied widely. Most schools earned an additional point in the newly added category of ""flexible scheduling and return-to-work policies.'

Professional fulfillment and parenting work-life balance in female physicians in Basic Sciences and medical research: a nationwide cross-sectional survey of all 80 medical schools in Japan,"Yamazaki, Y; Uka, T; Marui, E","Background: In Japan, the field of Basic Sciences encompasses clinical, academic, and translational research, as well as the teaching of medical sciences, with both an MD and PhD typically required. In this study, it was hypothesized that the characteristics of a Basic Sciences career path could offer the professional advancement and personal fulfillment that many female medical doctors would find advantageous. Moreover, encouraging interest in Basic Sciences could help stem shortages that Japan is experiencing in medical fields, as noted in the three principal contributing factors: premature resignation of female clinicians, an imbalance of female physicians engaged in research, and a shortage of medical doctors in the Basic Sciences. This study examines the professional and personal fulfillment expressed by Japanese female medical doctors who hold positions in Basic Sciences. Topics include career advancement, interest in medical research, and greater flexibility for parenting.Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was distributed at all 80 medical schools in Japan, directed to 228 female medical doctors whose academic rank was assistant professor or higher in departments of Basic Sciences in 2012. Chi-square tests and the binary logistic regression model were used to investigate the impact of parenthood on career satisfaction, academic rank, salary, etc.Results: The survey response rate of female physicians in Basic Sciences was 54.0%. Regardless of parental status, one in three respondents cited research interest as their rationale for entering Basic Sciences, well over twice other motivations. A majority had clinical experience, with clinical duties maintained part-time by about half of respondents and particularly parents. Only one third expressed afterthoughts about relinquishing full-time clinical practice, with physicians who were parents expressing stronger regrets. Parental status had little effect on academic rank and income within the Basic Sciences,Conclusion: Scientific curiosity and a desire to improve community health are hallmarks of those choosing a challenging career in medicine. Therefore, it is unsurprising that interest in research is the primary motivation for a female medical doctor to choose a career in Basic Sciences. Additionally, as with many young professionals with families, female doctors seek balance in professional and private lives.

"The Burnout in Canadian Pathology Initiative Pathologist Burnout Prevalence, Drivers, and Existing Mitigation Strategies","Keith, J","Context.-Burnout affects 44% of physicians, negatively impacts physicians and the patient care that they provide, and can be assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Forces contributing to physician burnout have been identified and grouped into 7 dimensions. Burnout within pathology has not been well studied. Objective.-To identify the prevalence of burnout within Canadian pathology, drivers of burnout important in pathology, and pathologist burnout mitigation strategies at an individual and departmental level.Design.-An electronic survey was disseminated by participating departmental chiefs and the Canadian Asso-ciation of Pathologists. Survey content included the Maslach Burnout Inventory and 3 free-text questions, including: ""What do you find most stressful about your work?""and ""What is working for you, at an individual or departmental level, to mitigate against burnout?""Com-parative statistics were performed by using Pearson v2. Significant relationships were sought between pathologistburnout and potential drivers, using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Responses to the qualitative questions were themed and mapped onto the 7 dimensions of burnout.Results.-Four hundred twenty-seven pathologists par-ticipated in the survey from all 10 Canadian provinces. The prevalence of burnout in Canadian pathology was 58% (246 respondents), and there were significant differences by gender and years in practice. Drivers of pathologist burnout included workload and chronic work-related pain. The most frequently reported effective departmental strategy to mitigate against burnout mapped to ""organiza-tional culture,""and the approach that most individual pathologists have taken to mitigate against burnout involves work-life integration.Conclusions.-Burnout within Canadian laboratory medicine is prevalent, and workload is a major driver.

Going to University at thirty-something: difficulties and facilitating factors,"Rodrigo, MLJ; Lepe, EM","The aims of this paper are, firstly, to analyze inequality, based on gender and age, as regards the participation of the non-traditional learners in higher education (HE), and secondly, to identify the main barriers and facilitating factors for this group in undertaking HE. The methodology combines secondary analysis of educational statistics and a case study on two degrees at the Universidad de Sevilla, which are characterized by a wider feminization and age heterogeneity. Results show that gender with age and life-cycle concerns means a central factor of inequality in access and academic progress at HE. Main difficulties met by older learners, and in particular by female students, are connected with study-work-life balance problems. Information and communications technologies are presented as the most important factor addressed to overcome these limitations.

Organisational barriers to and facilitators for female surgeons' career progression: a systematic review,"Hirayama, M; Fernando, S","Objective: To identify organizational barriers to and facilitators for female surgeons' career progression.Design: Systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies relating to organizational barriers to and facilitators for female Surgeons' career progression. After the quality assessment of the peer-reviewed journal articles, twelve articles were selected for full review. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes in these selected articles.Setting: The studies solely focused on organizational factors linked to female physicians' career progression in surgical specialties.Partcipants: Female surgeons.Main outcome measures: Organizational barriers and facilitatorsResults: Twelve peer-reviewed journal articles were included in the study which focused on barriers to female surgeons' career progression, ways of facilitating female surgeons' career progression, and female surgeons' job satisfaction.Conclusion: The major organisational factors contributing to the lack of career progression for female surgeons are (1) organizational culture which promotes rigid career structure that is inclined to support male surgeons than female surgeons and also male domination in which male surgeons feel superior to female surgeons (2) work family conflict whereby women feel that they have to make a family sacrifice by being women; they experience the difficulty in securing a work-life balance in the masculine career structure in surgical specialties. This implies that policy makers and healthcare organizations need to pay significant attention to organizational facilitators for female surgeons' career progression such as flexible career pathways and work patterns, a variety of different viable career progressions, more family-friendly working conditions, and the promotion of female mentors and role models in surgical specialties to support female surgeons in dealing with the organizational barriers in the male-dominated organizational culture and the lifestyle issues as well.",2018,,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE,111,9,324-334,WOS:000444978600006,10.1177/0141076818790661,,#368,Hirayama 2018,"",""
Flexibility in Faculty Work-Life Policies at Medical Schools in the Big Ten Conference: A Ten-Year Follow-up Study,"Wagner, EA; Jansen, JH; DeLuna, H; Anderson, K; Doehring, MC; Welch, JL","Background: Flexible work-life policies for medical school faculty are necessary to support career progress, advancement, retention, and job satisfaction.Objective: Our objective was to perform a 10-year follow-up descriptive assessment of the availability of flexible work-life policies for faculty in medical schools in the Big Ten Conference.Design: In this descriptive study, a modified objective scoring system was used to evaluate the flexibility of faculty work-life policies at 13 medical schools in the Big Ten Conference. Policy information was obtained from institutional websites and verified with the human resources offices. Scores from the 2011 study and 2020 were compared.Results: Michigan State and Ohio State Universities offered the most flexible policies (score 17.75/22) with the Universities of Maryland and Minnesota following (score 16/22). The largest delta scores, indicating more flexible policies in the past decade, were at University of Minnesota (5.25) and University of Michigan (5). Policies for parental leave and part-time faculty varied widely. Most schools earned an additional point in the newly added category of ""flexible scheduling and return-to-work policies."" Nearly every institution reported dedicated lactation spaces and improved childcare options.Limitations: Limitations included missing policy data and interpretation bias in reviewing the policy websites, unavailable baseline data for schools that joined the Big Ten after the 2011 study, and unavailable baseline data for the additional category of return-to-work policies.Conclusions: While progress has been made, every institution should challenge themselves to review flexibility in work-life policies for faculty. It is important to advance a healthy competition with the goal to achieve more forward-thinking policies that improve retention, recruitment, and advancement of faculty. Big Ten institutions can continue to advance their policies by providing greater ease of access to options, further expansion of parental leave and childcare support, and offering more flexible policies for part-time faculty.",2022,,WOMENS HEALTH REPORTS,3,1,67-77,WOS:000892383100010,10.1089/whr.2021.0070,,#369,Wagner 2022,"",""
Do Family Responsibilities and a Clinical Versus Research Faculty Position Affect Satisfaction with Career and Work-Life Balance for Medical School Faculty?,"Beckett, L; Nettiksimmons, J; Howell, LP; Villablanca, AC","Background: Balancing career and family obligations poses challenges to medical school faculty and contributes to dissatisfaction and attrition from academics. We examined the relationship between family setting and responsibilities, rank, and career and work-life satisfaction for faculty in a large U.S. medical school. Methods: Baseline faculty surveys were analyzed from the first year of a 4-year National Institutes of Health-funded study to evaluate awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and use of family friendly policies and career satisfaction. The study focus was on the impact of family responsibilities and characteristics of the faculty position (rank, clinical vs. nonclinical, and academic series) in multivariate comparisons between primary predictors and outcomes of interest. Results: Both clinical and family responsibilities for children under 18 play a major and interacting role in satisfaction with career and work-life balance. Clinical faculty respondents without children at home reported significantly greater career satisfaction and better work-life balance than their nonclinical counterparts. Nonclinical faculty respondents with children reported greater satisfaction and better balance than counterparts without family responsibilities. However, the advantage in career satisfaction and work-life balance for clinical faculty respondents disappeared for those with responsibility for young children. No gender-based differences were noted in the results or across faculty rank for respondents; however, for women, reaching associate professor resulted in greater career satisfaction. Conclusion: This study suggests that both work-related factors and family responsibilities influence satisfaction with career and work-life balance, but the predictors appear to interact in complex and nuanced ways.

What female surgeons wish for!,"Berger-Groch, J; Beck, P; Ostendorf, S; Rösch, RM","Background: Surgical specialties have a recruitment problem. A magnification of the problem is often seen in the ""feminization"" of medicine but the causes are multifactorial. Female physicians of the association ""Die Chirurginnen e. V."" want to raise enthusiasm for their profession and strengthen the affinity for a surgical specialty by increasing the visibility and networking of female surgeons. The aim of this article is to present the results of a survey among female surgeons and to discuss them in the focus of the current shortage of personnel. Methodology: An anonymized online survey was conducted internally within the association (""Die Chirurginnen e. V."") in October 2022. The survey contained a total of 57 questions and was divided into 7 sections (demographic data, questions about wishes in professional life, private life, social life, towards professional associations, politics and the association). Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. Results: A total of 358 female surgeons participated in the survey. This represented a response rate of 25.5% of association members (as of October 2022: n= 1406). The mean age was 39.25 years (+/- 8.06 years; range 25-65 years), 37% (n= 133) were in the specialty of orthopedic and trauma surgery and 26% (n= 93) were in the specialty of visceral surgery. The remainder were distributed across a variety of different surgical specialties. The desire for change was preferentially in the area of continuing surgical education, the implementation of working time models, and the organization of the personal workday (operating room time, administrative tasks, time for patients, bureaucracy). Discussion: Motivated and dedicated surgeons are needed to counteract the already existing and increasingly severe shortage of manpower. In recent decades, the proportion of female students and physicians has been increasing, so the needs for recruitment must be increasingly considered. The disparity between men and women at the management level must be gradually resolved. In addition, alternative working models for both genders need to be established in daily practice.

The focal article by Gabriel et al. provides a valuable overview on how department heads and other faculty members can support female scholars to navigate the complex demands of pregnancy, motherhood, and childcare in academia. However, we argue that these issues are rooted in wider academic and societal trends, and therefore need to be considered from a broader perspective. The focal article implies that work–life balance policy changes, combined with the goodwill and allyship of heads of departments and academic co-workers, will provide the much-needed solutions. Considering that many European countries have decent national regulations regarding maternity and parental leave in place, we make the case that, although policies are necessary for creating bearable situations and do work, they are not enough. The focal article’s suggestions for supporting female scholars focus on individual level strategies within organizations, as the political system in the US does not provide decent regulations that protect their well-being and work–life balance.

Gender discrepancies related to pediatrician work-life balance and household responsibilities,"Starmer, Amy J.; Frintner, Mary Pat; Matos, Kenneth; Somberg, Chloe; Freed, Gary; Byrne, Bobbi J.","Background: Physicians must balance career and home responsibilities, yet previous studies on work-life balance are focused primarily on work-based tasks. We examined gender discrepancies and factors related to household responsibilities and work-life balance among pediatricians. Methods: We used 2015 data from the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study, a longitudinal study of early-career pediatricians. χ² tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the effects of gender on household responsibilities, satisfaction, and work-life balance attainment. We formally reviewed responses from 2 open-ended questions on work-life balance challenges and strategies for common themes. Results: Seventy-two percent of participants completed the survey (1293 of 1801). Women were more likely than men to report having primary responsibility for 13 of 16 household responsibilities, such as cleaning, cooking, and routine care of children (all P < .001). All gender differences except budget management remained significant when controlling for part-time work status and spouse or partner work status (P < .05). Women were less satisfied with their share of responsibilities relative to others (52% vs 62%; P < .001), and few women and men report being very successful at achieving balance between their job and other life areas (15% vs 19%, respectively; P = .05). Open-ended responses (n = 1145) revealed many barriers to achieving work-life balance. Strategies to increase work-life balance included reducing work hours, outsourcing household-related work, and adjustments to personal responsibilities and relationships. Conclusions: Female pediatricians spend more time on household responsibilities than male pediatricians, and gender is a key factor associated with work-life balance satisfaction.

How ‘flexible’ are careers in the anticipated life course of young people?,"McDonald, Paula K.","Bridging literature that addresses the work–family interface and the changing nature of careers, this article examines, from a life course perspective, the extent to which, and why, young people anticipate careers as ‘flexible’. Drawing on 123 interviews with men and women engaged in different post-secondary education pathways in Australia, the study draws attention to the role of gender and to some extent class in shaping careers in a network of social relations. Three dimensions of flexible careers are examined: temporal, that is, through imagined possibilities in various stages of early adulthood; structural, including opportunities and constraints afforded by different industry sectors and workplaces; and relational, in terms of household-level role negotiations. The findings revealed that women continue to adapt their career goals to accommodate care, but that both men’s and women’s careers are shaped by contingencies including household income, home ownership, access to flexible work and ideological expectations of market/family work roles. These contextual dynamics directly impact on decisions in the present. The article underscores the need for an expanded research focus on work and care from a life course perspective in order to promote career flexibility in ways that align with young people’s broader aspirations for gender equality.

Problems with family/career balance, age- and gender-based discrimination and harassment, salary inequity, and professional isolation persisted throughout their careers, but diminished in frequency for senior women. Conclusions: Issues faced by younger women physicians do not disappear with age or seniority. To recruit and support female physicians, issues such as balancing family/work responsibilities, combating harassment and bias, and promoting healthy work environments must be addressed throughout their entire careers.

"Re: 'Academic productivity differences by gender and child age in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic' by Krukowski et al","Katz, Nicole B.; Bryan, Katherine M.; Jumreornvong, Oranicha; Sarno, Danielle L.; Ulep, Robin D.; Englander, Meridith J.","Comments on an article by R. A. Krukowski et al. (see record [rid]2021-25286-010[/rid]). The authors assessed the impact of gender and parental status on academic productivity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their self-reported survey of 284 Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) faculty members revealed that women reported providing significantly more childcare than men. In addition, parents with children ages 0–5 years at home during the pandemic reported submitting fewer senior- and coauthored articles and grants and working significantly fewer work hours per week compared with pre-pandemic times. As the authors poignantly noted, given both the aforementioned findings and that chosen reproductive years often overlap with the early career stage of scientific careers, early career women with young children may be disproportionately adversely impacted by the pandemic. This study’s findings are an important piece in the larger conversation surrounding the fertility of female professionals. Supporting women professionals with young children by creating equitable work environments is essential, as the long-term effects of women attrition from academia may be stark.The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that practices can successfully change rapidly when deemed necessary, and the findings of Krukowski et al. illustrate the necessity for swift implementation of parental policies to prevent furthering gender inequities in academia.

Review of Do babies matter? Gender and family in the ivory tower,"Britton, Dana M.","Reviews the book, Do Babies Matter? Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower by Mary Ann Mason, Nicholas H. Wolfinger, and Marc Goulden (see record [rid]2013-27872-000[/rid]). The book argues that the most important factor impeding women’s careers in STEM, and the academy more generally, is the difficulty women face in balancing work and family. The book is divided into six chapters. Four capture stages of the academic life cycle: graduate school and postdoctoral experiences, getting a job, obtaining tenure, and promotion to full professor through retirement. The utility of this book lies in its value as a resource. Mason and her coauthors present convincing data on how heterosexual marriage and family formation matter for women in the academy and particularly for women in STEM. This book would be an excellent resource for women faculty and graduate students and would work well as a text in a course on gender and work. I find that students are often completely unaware that the university is a workplace like any other, with equally (and sometimes more) vexing patterns of gender discrimination. It would also serve as an excellent primer for university department chairs and administrators on the problems faced by faculty mothers and on the solutions that might make our institutions more family friendly.

The study was carried out in relational screening model. The research population consists of people who work as primary school teachers, Turkish language teachers and administrators in Turkey and Northern Cyprus in the 2021-2022 academic year. The sample consisted of a total of 1059 people, 836 of whom were teachers and 223 of whom were administrators, selected using random sampling method. The data of the study were collected through an online questionnaire that included the Personal Information Form and the Work-Life Balance Scale. The data collected within the scope of the study were evaluated with quantitative analysis methods using the SPSS-26 software. In this context, frequency analysis, descriptive statistics methods, independent groups t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD test were used. As a result of the study, it was observed that the participants were able to maintain work-life balance at a moderate level. In general, work-life balance does not differ significantly according to gender, marital status, having children and status (p>0.05), but the participants aged 51 and above have a significantly higher work-life balance than the participants aged 22-30 (p<0.05), and, results according to sub-dimensions are presented in the study.",2023,,Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET,22,3,21-30,2901458185; EJ1401561,,,#396,Vaiz 2023,"",""
Work Life Balance among Female School Teachers [K-12] Delivering Online Curriculum in Noida [India] during COVID: Empirical Study,"Rawal, Debyani Mukherjee","Job satisfaction is a vital factor regarding turnover rates, especially among women. Work life balance today, especially in times of COVID where home and work place have transgressed boundaries is an imperative precursor for the well-being of an individual. A satisfying job well-integrated into life, balances the overall mental and emotional quotient of working women particularly in the current pandemic in which the workplace is posing a new and unlike set of challenges and problems for women. Research suggests that work place problems faced by the Indian women are mostly long working hours, less recognition of work, lack of motivation and stress related issues, but the new normal of working remotely from home now is altogether an unexpected work scenario. With respect to emerging nations, problems of work life balance among women in the education sector are not well researched. Increased women employment has led to a swelling attention from academia and industry on WLB. With greater access to better educational opportunities, increasing number of women are entering the workforce, and shifting from being home-makers to the organized work force, thereby necessitating an urgent need to examine this phenomenon. Carrying on with online classes remotely has become the order of the day, and it is becoming stressful when both school and personal life operate from the same space.

Career-Life Balance for Women of Color: Experiences in Science and Engineering Academia,"Kachchaf, Rachel; Ko, Lily; Hodari, Apriel; Ong, Maria","The National Science Foundation recently recognized that career-life balance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) may present some unique challenges for women of color compared with their White and/or male counterparts, thus negatively impacting retention and advancement for a minority demographic that has long been underrepresented in STEM (National Science Foundation, 2011). However, there is a dearth of literature on this topic. This article advances our understanding of the nature of these challenges by analyzing career-life balance issues for three underrepresented minority women and the impact of these issues on their career trajectories. We explore the experiences of these women, at different stages of pursuing STEM academia, as they encounter career-life balance issues. Using the approach of narrative inquiry, we describe the interplay between domestic realities (e.g., social life, elder care, pregnancy) and the ""ideal worker norm,"" a prevalent gendered standard within STEM of pure dedication to scientific work. Using the lens of ""cumulative disadvantage"" we examine how the intersection of racial/ethnic and gender identities generated a set of experiences for each participant that positioned her outside that norm, resulting in significant obstacles (e.g., exclusion from professional networks, lack of support, questioning of competence). We describe how continual tension with the ideal worker norm impacted these women's career trajectories, illustrate how their experiences of career-life balance may be different from those who more closely embody the norm, and detail issues that need to be addressed to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women of color in STEM academia.",2015,,Journal of Diversity in Higher Education,8,3,175-191,1773219524; EJ1072074,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0039068,,#399,Kachchaf 2015,"",""

Their views of STEM research being less family-friendly were more pronounced on issues of parental leaves and caring for children than finding a spouse/partner and landing two jobs in the same locality. To provide role models of work-life balance in STEM professions, we convened panels of dual-career couples who described how they worked together to raise their children while advancing their scientific careers. Our selection of panelists and topics of discussion were based on findings of social science research on work-life balance.

Work and Family Balance in Top Diplomacy: The Case of the Czech Republic,"Fellegi, Zuzana; Kočí, Kateřina; Benešová, Klára","While female representation in the top diplomatic circles was almost nonexistent during the Czechoslovak era, the number of female diplomats in the Czech Republic has steadily increased since the fall of the state-socialist regime.

This study examines the main challenges that influence the careers of top diplomats using quantitative and qualitative data, including official statistics and documents of the Czech MFA and interviews with top diplomats and officials. The results indicate that work-family conflicts are the main challenge for all diplomats.

"""For Passion or for Future Family?"" Exploring Factors Influencing Career and Family Choices of Female Medical Students and Residents","Kwon, Eugena","Over the last decade, a significant change in medical school applications has occurred, with more than 50 % of applicants being female. Despite the significant increase in the number of women entering the medical profession, there is evidence that a gendered hierarchy persists. Female medical students are more likely than their male colleagues to enter and practice in less prestigious medical specializations and are less likely to enter more prestigious fields such as surgery. This paper assesses two competing explanations for female medical students' specialty choices. Does women's choice appear to reflect their preference for family and their gender role socialization; or rather the structural barriers and constraints that women still experience in male-dominant fields? Drawing from qualitative data collected from 15 female medical students and residents in Ontario, Canada--this study explores whether Canadian female students and residents anticipate having a difficult time combining career and family life, and how these expectations shape their specialty choice. The findings suggest that structural barriers within the medical field deter women from pursuing certain specializations.",2017,,Gender Issues,34,2,186-200,1892910752,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12147-016-9168-3,,#408,Kwon 2017,"",""
"Why Having a Family-Supportive Culture, Not Just Policies, Matters to Male and Female Job Seekers: An Examination of Work-Family Conflict, Values, and Self-Interest","Wayne, Julie Holliday; Casper, Wendy J","A common strategy to recruit job seekers, particularly women, is to develop and market a family-supportive workplace. We conducted two studies to investigate whether family-supportive policies and/or culture influenced organizational attractiveness, whether gender differences exist, and three theoretically based reasons why they might exist: (a) women anticipating or experiencing greater work-to-family conflict, (b) women having stronger family values, and (c) women expecting to benefit more from family-supportive practices than do men. In Study 1, 195 undergraduate students rated their attraction to a firm using a 3 (Type of Policy: dependent care assistance, flexible work arrangements, control) x 3 (Work-Family Culture: supportive, unsupportive, control) x 2 (Participant Gender) between-subjects design. A supportive work-family culture was associated with higher ratings of organizational attractiveness than was an unsupportive culture, and the effect was stronger for women. The effect of culture on organizational attractiveness was partially mediated by anticipated work-family conflict, but this mediation did not explain gender differences. In Study 2, we surveyed 255 job-seeking and working adults about the importance of family-supportive policies and culture to job choice. Participants rated a family-supportive culture as more important than policies to job choice, and women valued culture more than did men. The gender difference was explained by women's stronger belief that they would benefit from a family-supportive culture rather than differences in values or work-family conflict. Results suggest that organizations that develop and market a family-supportive culture, rather than only policies, are more appealing to job seekers, especially women.",2016,,Sex Roles,75,9-10,459-475,1840619059,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0645-7,,#409,Wayne 2016,"",""
"Contributions of Perfectionism and Social Support to the Prediction of Work-Family Conflict among Women Academics in Oyo State, Nigeria","Akanbi, Samuel Toyin","The current study observed the predictive influence of perfectionism and social support on Work-Family Conflict (WFC) among women academics. A correlational method was employed for the study, one hundred and sixty-eight women academics in tertiary institutions in Oyo State were engaged in the study through a purposive random sampling technique. Three major psychological instruments were adopted for data gathering: Work-Family Conflict Scale (a = .87); Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (a = .78), and Almost Perfect Scale (α= .84). Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) and multiple regression statistics were used to analyse data. The findings showed that a combination of the independent variables jointly accounted for about 39% of the total variance in WFC (F^sub (4, 167)^ = 26.183, P < 0.01). Based on the degree of magnitude of each predictor variables in predicting WFC, the study showed that Social Support (β= -.365; t= -5.659, p < 0.01), Discrepancy (β = .268, t = 4.234 p<), High Standard (β =-.273, t =-4.430, p < 0.01), and Order (β =-.148, t =-2.350, p = .02) in that order significantly predicted WFC.

Striving to achieve it all: men and work-family-life balance in Sweden and the UK,"Raiden, Ani Birgit; Raisanen, Christine","Although there is a vast literature on issues of work-life balance, most of the research is grounded on the traditional view of work-life balance as a female-oriented entitlement. So far little attention has been paid to how men balance their work-life situations, especially the 'new men' who are keen to share the family care. We contribute to filling this gap by critically examining how male academics in construction-related departments at universities in Sweden and the UK construct their relationships with family and work. Narrative analysis was applied on in-depth interviews with seven academics from each country, who were at different phases in their careers. Three core narratives emerged from the data: family connected with partner; work as key priority; and desire to pursue personal projects, all of which competed for the narrators' sparse time. The narrative that by far received most space and most storylines in all the interviews was 'work as priority', implying that in spite of gender equality policies and campaigns, work-life balance remains a female-oriented concern. Both Swedish and British men in our sample found juggling family and life most challenging. This work-family-life triad left many feeling that they had no time to do a good job in any sphere and in Sweden in particular combination pressure was intense. Curiously, despite these tensions and increasing demands for many of our respondents work remains a positive construct, possibly because of the strong conceptual identification of 'self' as an academic. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",2013,,Construction Management and Economics,31,8,899-913,,10.1080/01446193.2013.802364,,#412,Raiden 2013,"",""
