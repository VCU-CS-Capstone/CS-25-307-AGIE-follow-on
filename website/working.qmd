Our team prefers to create presentations and documents using google docs.  Here are links to our working documents.

## Links to working draft documents

These links point to our key working and drafting documents.  Eventually, we'll convert these drafts into PDF, store
them in our *./deliverables* folder, list them in our *Project Deliverables* section of this page.
